This week, representatives of both the White House and the State Department said the US was planning one more military aid package to Ukraine - but that it had limited ability to send more help after that unless Congress acted. \nThe US setback was followed by Hungary's blocking of the EU's €50bn ($55bn; £43bn) financial aid deal last week. EU leaders, however, said Ukraine would not be left without support.\nUkraine is facing an ammunition shortage as it continues to fight occupying Russian forces, following Moscow's full-scale invasion in February 2022.\nKyiv's counter-offensive ground to a halt at the start of winter and there are fears that the Russians could simply outgun Ukraine.\nOlena Zelenska, Ukraine's first lady, warned in a BBC interview earlier this month that Ukrainians were in \"mortal danger\" of being left to die without further Western support.\nRussia President Vladimir Putin said this week that Moscow would continue its invasion, vowing that all his goals would be achieved.\nThe Kremlin leader also said that 617,000 Russian soldiers were currently taking part in what Moscow describes as its \"special military operation\". But he admitted that the armed forces had problems with air defence systems and communication, and needed to increase the production of drones.\nPresident Zelensky's end-of-year news conference was held in the Ukrainian capital on Tuesday, with the time and venue being kept secret from the general public. Invited Ukrainian and foreign media had been given the details in their confirmation letters.\nAppearing in his trademark military-style clothes, the Ukrainian leader was asked a wide range of questions during the two-hour event.\nHe revealed that Ukraine's top military commanders had \"proposed to mobilise an additional 450,000-500,000 individuals\" for the country's war effort.\nHe said this was a \"very serious number\" and he needed more in-depth discussion before committing to the plan.\n\"I need specifics: what will happen to the million-strong army of Ukraine, what will happen to those guys who have been defending our state for two years? We have issues of rotation and holidays. It should be a comprehensive plan.\"\nBut he ruled out any proposals to mobilise women.\nWhen asked by the BBC's Jessica Parker about whether Ukraine could be on the cusp of starting to lose the war, Mr Zelensky was firm. \"No,\" was the answer.\nIt's the answer you would expect, but he's not alone in expressing this kind of determination, our correspondent in Kyiv says. Many people she has met will not countenance anything other than beating back their Russian invaders, she adds.  \nDuring the briefing, Mr Zelensky also said that:\nDuring the whole event, the Ukrainian president sought to strike a confident note - but sometimes he appeared to be tense and tetchy when pressed over reports of corruption among Ukrainian government officials and lawmakers."}

Late on Tuesday, the US Deputy Ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, was asked by the BBC whether the US supported the draft resolution and he said: \"We're still working on the text with other players and I don't want to get ahead of where we are at this point. So let's just see how the discussions go this afternoon.\"\nDiplomats say the main sticking points are how to frame calls for a cessation of hostilities and the proposal for a UN mechanism to inspect aid going into Gaza. The US, along with Israel, opposes a ceasefire because they say it would benefit Hamas. Washington vetoed a previous Security Council resolution demanding one. The UK abstained, but every other member supported it. And Israel, according to one Security Council diplomat, is pressuring the US to veto this resolution as well, out of fear that a UN mechanism to monitor aid would prevent them from controlling deliveries in Gaza.\nWhen US state department spokesperson Matt Miller was asked whether Israel had asked the US to veto it, he said they had been in discussions with their ally, as well as other countries in the region, and they would ultimately make their own determination about what the best course of action was depending on what the final resolution stated. The current draft has already been watered down and now calls for a suspension of hostilities, rather than a sustainable cessation of hostilities, but it still includes a phrase calling for \"urgent steps\" towards a sustainable cessation of hostilities.\nThe UAE's Ambassador to the UN, Lana Nusseibeh, said the priority and focus of the resolution were to have a real impact on the ground with a scaling-up of access, the opening of all land, sea and air crossing points, and ensuring Egypt has the support it needed from the UN in the form of a mechanism to streamline the process of monitoring aid. But overriding all of that, she said, was ensuring that humanitarian workers could deliver aid safely and were protected by the normal rules of de-confliction.\nBut the Israeli government is under growing international pressure to agree to a ceasefire because of the mounting civilian casualties in Gaza.\nIt is also facing pressure at home for a deal that would see more hostages freed, after Israeli soldiers mistakenly killed three Israeli men who had been held captive in Gaza last week.\nGaza has been devastated by the war, which was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 taken hostage.\nSince then, more than 19,600 people have been killed in Gaza, about 70% of them women and children, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nIt reported that about 100 Palestinians had been killed in Israeli air strikes on Tuesday.\nAhead of the Security Council meeting, UN aid workers in Geneva could not hide their despair at the failure of the international community to put an end to the conflict and tackle the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza.\nUnicef spokesman James Elder, who recently returned from the territory, told reporters that \"every single child is enduring these 10 weeks of hell and not one of them can escape\".\nHe lamented that \"not even lip service\" had been paid to requirements, under international law, to safeguard medical facilities, food and water.\nOnly eight of Gaza's 36 hospitals are still partially functioning, according to the World Health Organization. They are overwhelmed by casualties and facing critical shortages of medical supplies and fuel for generators, as well as providing shelter for thousands of displaced people.\nWHO spokeswoman Dr Margaret Harris said her colleagues in Gaza had run out of \"words to describe the horror\" they were witnessing. They were not even able to walk through emergency wards at \"for fear of stepping on people\" lying on the floor \"in severe pain\" and asking for food and water, she added."}

But a conviction for assaulting his girlfriend has left his career in tatters and mounting questions over where Marvel goes next.\nMajors was due to be at the heart of movies that Marvel is pinning its hopes on to turn its fortunes around - and that were expected to cement his status in Hollywood's A-list.\nHis first appearance as supervillain Kang the Conqueror was praised by many as the best thing about Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, which got otherwise mixed reviews and box office results when it came out in February.\n\"Magnetic Jonathan Majors is the saving grace of Marvel's baffling, illogical latest outing,\" said the Observer.\n\"You're on edge every moment he's onscreen\", wrote the Hollywood Reporter. Time Out added: \"There's a lot more Majors to come in future Marvel films and he's really the only thing here that makes a continued story look even vaguely enticing.\"\nHowever, Majors has now been dropped from two planned Avengers movies after being found guilty of two charges of assault and harassment relating to an altercation with then-girlfriend Grace Jabbari in New York in March. He was found not guilty of two further charges.\nMajors' career had been on the rise since he broke through in acclaimed 2019 drama The Last Black Man in San Francisco, before going on to star in Netflix western The Harder They Fall.\nHe also appeared in Spike Lee's war drama film Da 5 Bloods, earned an Emmy nomination for HBO's Lovecraft Country, and played Michael B Jordan's adversary in boxing sequel Creed III earlier this year.\nAnd he was hotly tipped for an Oscar nomination after playing an amateur bodybuilder in another drama, Magazine Dreams, following its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year - but its release was delayed after his arrest.\nMarvel Studios recruited the actor to play variants of the mighty multiverse-spanning Kang in Disney+ series Loki, and he made his big-screen Marvel debut in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.\nThose who stayed for the credits will have seen how that film teased future storylines for Kang - or many versions of Kang.\n\"Kang was the new 'big bad' that they were setting up for the MCU after Thanos,\" explains Alvin Addo-Quaye, who runs Big A movie and pop culture reviews on TikTok. \"They were really setting him up for the future Avengers movies.\"\nThe name of Majors' character is even in the title of Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, which is slated for release in 2026; and he was due to have a major part in Avengers: Secret Wars, which is scheduled for 2027.\n\"Marvel had more riding on Jonathan Majors than perhaps any other actor,\" according to the Associated Press's film writer Jake Coyle. \"Now it's parting ways with him, and throwing years of plans for its cinematic universe in disarray.\"\nRolling Stone magazine's Alan Sepinwall wrote: \"It's not tenable to build the next phase of a mega-billions franchise around an actor whose criminal history will dominate the press cycle for each film.\"\nEven before the verdict, there were already reports that Marvel did not \"see a path to how they move forward\" with Majors.\nWhile Majors maintained his innocence, Ms Jabbari's testimony - along with text messages revealing a previous injury and Majors calling himself a \"monster\", and audio of him talking of his \"temper\" and that he was a \"great man\" - meant his reputation had suffered serious damage.\nMarvel's decision to dump him comes as the studio is seeking to re-establish itself as the all-conquering blockbuster machine following a string of lukewarm performances.\nThe studio's latest release, The Marvels, recorded its lowest box office opening, and once-enthusiastic audiences have been diagnosed with a condition dubbed \"superhero fatigue\".\nSo the company could take Majors' departure as a moment to overhaul its plans and kick-start a change in direction.\nAvengers: The Kang Dynasty has not started filming and lost director Destin Daniel Cretton last month, with Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness writer Michael Waldron recently coming on board to rework the story.\nThe film could move away from the Kang character and pivot to a different antagonist, with other supervillain storylines such as Doctor Doom yet to be explored in the MCU.\nHowever, Marvel may not be so willing to part from the Kang storyline quite so easily, with half a decade's worth of projects based around the character.\nThat leaves them with the option to replace Majors with a different actor - which is not unprecedented in the Marvel universe.\nMark Ruffalo took over as Bruce Banner and The Hulk after Edward Norton left the MCU citing creative differences; and Don Cheadle stepped in as Colonel James Rhodes after Terrance Howard left the cast because of pay disputes.\n\"Their options are recast, or leave what they have done and and introduce a new villain, but that's going to take a lot of time,\" Addo-Quaye says.\n\"I personally would prefer recast. Even though we've only seen Jonathan Majors play Kang and the various different versions of Kang, I would still be fine for another actor to take on the role because you can you can suspend your disbelief.\n\"It's a comic book movie at the end of the day. I think doing a new villain is too much of a long haul.\"\nFor Majors himself, the solution is perhaps less simple.\nThese were misdemeanour charges, and he faces up to a year in jail or probation when he's sentenced in February.\nOther actors have come back from similar situations after time and repentance, with independent films more likely to offer him a route than big studios.\nOne of Hollywood's most promising talents is unlikely to return to the same heights, and he is the only one to blame."}

Since late October, the region around Reykjavik has been experiencing an increase in earthquake activity. \nThe eruption can be seen from Reykjavik, which is about 42km north-east of Grindavik.\nAn eyewitness in the capital told the BBC that half of the sky in the direction of the town was \"lit up in red\" from the eruption, and smoke could be seen billowing into the air.\nOn Tuesday, British tourists Amrit and Peter, a married couple in their 20s, took selfies with the bright orange lava in the background.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Peter said: \"We are not scared at all, the Icelandic authorities are handling this well and keep giving us information. We feel totally safe.\" \nIn 2010, a volcanic eruption caused an ash plume to rise several kilometres into the atmosphere, leading to several days of air travel disruption in Europe.\nVolcanologist Dr Evgenia Ilyinskaya told the BBC that there would not be the same level of disruption as 2010, as these volcanoes in south-west Iceland were \"physically not able to generate the same ash clouds\". \nSpeaking from Iceland, Dr Ilyinskaya, associate professor of volcanology at Leeds University, said local people had been both \"fearing and waiting for\" the volcano to erupt.\nShe added that authorities were preparing for potential lava flows that could destroy homes and infrastructure, including the Blue Lagoon, a popular tourist destination. \n\"At the moment it seems not to be threatening, although it remains to be seen,\" she said.\nThe Icelandic Met Office said at 12:30 GMT on Tuesday that the power of the eruption was decreasing, but that gases from the volcano could still reach Reykjavik. \nAoalheiour Halldorsdottir, who lives in Sandgeroi - about 20km from Grindavik - said she had seen the eruption from her home. \n\"It was crazy to see it with my own eyes. We have had volcano explosions before, but this was the first time I got really scared,\" she told BBC News. \n\"We're used to volcanoes [erupting], but this was crazy.\" \nShe said there was some \"panic\" on Monday night, and that she had bought extra supplies of water, but that things had largely returned to normal on Tuesday. \n\"I'm at work now and I can still see it. I can see the lights in the sky,\" she said. \nHans Vera was evacuated from Grindavik last month, but hoped before Monday's eruption to return home for Christmas. \nBut he said: \"I don't see that in the future they will let people get close to Grindavik - so we are back in the waiting game.\" \nIceland's foreign minister, Bjarni Benediktsson said on X, formerly Twitter, that \"there are no disruptions to flights to and from Iceland, and international flight corridors remain open\". \n\"The jets [of lava] are quite high, so it appears to be a powerful eruption at the beginning,\" he said.\nImages and videos posted on social media showed lava bursting from the volcano just an hour after an earthquake swarm - a series of seismic events - was detected.\nPolice have warned people to stay away from the area.\nThe length of the crack in the volcano is about 3.5km, with the lava flowing at a rate of around 100 to 200 cubic metres per second, the Met Office said, adding that this was many times more than recent eruptions on the Reykjanes peninsula. \nIceland's Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir said defences recently constructed would have a positive effect.\nShe said her thoughts were with the local community and she was hoping for the best despite the \"significant event\".\nPresident Gudni Johannesson said safeguarding lives was the main priority but that every effort would be made to protect structures too.\nAre you in Iceland?

It is bookended by the Bab al-Mandab Strait - also known as the Gate of Tears - in the south near the coast of Yemen and the Suez Canal in the north.\nHouthis have declared their backing for Hamas in its war with the Israelis and the rebels based in Yemen said they were targeting vessels which they believe are heading for Israel.\nHowever, some firms, such as Investor Chemical Tankers, whose Swan Atlantic vessel was attacked on Monday, said that its ship had no links to Israel.\nShipping firms have reported vessels coming under attack from drones and missiles.\n\"The ballistic missiles are really the tough one. This is the first time we've ever seen ships hit by this type of weapon,\" Sal Mercogliano, a naval historian at Campbell University, told the BBC.\n\"It's a very difficult type of missile to shoot down.\"\nDespite the launch of the international operation to ensure safe passage through the Red Sea, Maersk said it was not clear when it would resume journeys along the route, and would assess things on a case-by-case basis.\nIt said while it was pleased to hear of efforts to improve security in the area, \"at this time it remains difficult to determine\" when it would return to the Red Sea route.\nMeanwhile, Hapag-Lloyd, a German firm whose Al Jasrah vessel was attacked last Friday, said that while it welcomed the new task force, the company needed 100% assurance the Red Sea was safe for ships to return.\nThe alternative route, around the Cape of Good Hope, adds about 3,500 nautical miles to the journey.\nHapag-Lloyd's head of corporate communications Nils Haupt told the BBC: \"We go from the eastern Med to Singapore. Normally it takes 13 days through the [Suez] Canal - without using the canal that will be 31 days.\"\nAttacks on ships have intensified in recent days. Investor Chemical Tankers said its Swan Atlantic tanker was hit by an \"unidentified object\" on Monday, while Maersk described the situation as \"alarming\" on Friday after a \"near-miss\" incident involving Maersk Gibraltar and another attack on a container ship.\nOil giant BP said on Monday that it would temporarily pause all shipments of crude through the route. Rival energy giant Shell has yet to comment.\nAt the moment, changes to the oil price have been minimal. Prices rose 1% on Monday, but on Tuesday they were little changed with benchmark Brent crude trading at around $78 a barrel.\nAs petrol is derived from oil, increases in the price of crude usually feed through to higher costs at the pump.\nBut Simon Williams, the RAC motoring group's fuel spokesman, said while tankers avoiding the Red Sea had the \"potential to push up the oil price, the barrel is still below $80, $15 lower than it was at the end of September\". \"Talk of this immediately affecting fuel prices is unhelpful as we are still waiting for retailers to fully pass on the savings from much lower wholesale costs. We don't want to give them a reason not to continuing cutting their prices, especially at the most expensive time of the year,\" he added.\nMr Williams argued current petrol prices at £1.42 should be around 10p cheaper on average. \"This means even if the Red Sea situation worsens, there is no reason for the biggest retailers to push up prices as fuel is still overpriced,\" he added.\nRichard Meade, editor-in-chief of shipping newspaper Lloyd's List, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"What is going to be very interesting is if the tankers continue to reroute.\n\"That's a much more finely balanced market that could have serious implications for the global supply chain.\"\nBut rerouting will affect more than just oil. Mr Meade said 12% of global trade was taken through the Red Sea, which is about $1 trillion worth of goods a year.\n\"We've seen most of the main container carriers - these are the ones that carry finished goods, TVs, electronics, trainers - they have almost exclusively started rerouting,\" he said.\nHapag-Lloyd told the BBC that it will have rerouted 25 ships by the end of the year, costing it tens of millions of dollars as the ships were booked before the attacks. However, it said new orders would \"probably\" see a rise in costs.\n\"This industry is keeping world trade alive and attacks on merchant shipping are unacceptable,\" said Mr Haupt.\nMarco Forgiona, from the Institute of Export and International Trade, told the BBC that rerouting would increase fuel and insurance costs for shipping, \"and then you've got the issue that the ships are in the wrong place, the containers are in the wrong place and you get the potential for congestion at the ports and further delays\".\nHowever, Mr Haupt said that while he expected to see congestion at some ports in a few weeks, \"I don't think it will be as tough as we have seen it during Covid.\n\"Yes we will see some disruption and we might see delays, but I would not expect this to be a total disruption of the supply chain.\"\nS&P Global Market Intelligence said that nearly 15% of goods imported into Europe, the Middle East and North Africa were shipped from Asia and the Gulf by sea. That includes 21.5% of refined oil and more than 13% of crude oil.\nA rise in oil prices can lead to higher inflation, which measures the pace of price rises. Inflation has been falling in the UK and is currently 4.6%.\nNew figures out on Wednesday will show whether it has continued to drop but, at the current level, it is still more than twice the Bank of England's 2% target. The Bank has, until recent months, been raising interest rates to cool inflation."}

They were shot, strangled or stabbed to death.\nShortly before the jury in Paris retired to consider her role in the crimes, Olivier expressed regret and asked for forgiveness from her victims' families.\nShe told the court: \"I regret everything I did and I ask for forgiveness from the families of the victims, while knowing that it is unforgivable.\"\nDuring sentencing on Tuesday, the court was told Estelle Mouzin was coming home from school at 6pm, but that she never made it.\nHer body has never been found.\nOlivier was questioned for hundreds of hours in 2019, and accepted Fourniret had left for France, looking for a young girl to rape.\nThe court heard she knew he had \"gone hunting\".\nDuring sentencing, President of the court Didier Safar said: \"This is about the extreme gravity of the facts that contributed to the death of two young women, and a nine-year-old girl, in inhumane circumstances.\n\"Monique Olivier had no empathy for her victims, who she dehumanised.\"\nMost of Fourniret's victims were killed in the Ardennes region of northern France and in Belgium.\nLanguages student Miss Parrish had moved from Newnham-on-Severn in Gloucestershire, to Auxerre in France in 1990 for part of her university course.\nBut after posting an advert offering English lessons, she was murdered by Fourniret.\nHer body was found in the Yonne River on 17 May. She had been raped, beaten and strangled.\nMr Seban said he hoped this trial would start a new chapter in French justice, adding: \"For the Parrish family, it has been hard.\n\"They've waited more than 30 years for this trial. They led the charge, coming every year to Auxerre to show their drive to get this done.\n\"Their dignity throughout… there hasn't been an angry word, a cry or a desire of vengeance.

But among those who want to get in his way are wealthy mining magnate Moïse Katumbi and former oil executive Martin Fayulu, who believes that he won the last election in 2018, the result of which was questioned by several international observers.\nBut the peaceful transfer of power, the first in the country's history, following that poll became a source of optimism that the country had turned a corner.\nAs before, in this election there is only one round of voting and the winner will be the candidate with the most votes. The large number of challengers to Mr Tshisekedi could work to his advantage, as it may divide opposition support.\nVoters are also choosing parliamentary, provincial and municipal representatives - with about 100,000 candidates in total - in this huge country, which stretches some 2,000km (1,400 miles) west to east.\nIn order to help get voting materials to the more than 175,000 polling booths, the electoral commission has enlisted the help of UN peacekeepers.\nIn the east, insecurity has dominated the run-up to the polls.\nDozens of armed groups have been competing to control parts of the region.\nThe presence of a UN peacekeeping force, an East African regional force and Congolese soldiers has not quelled the violence, which has resulted in millions being forced form their homes. Many of those have not been able to register to vote, in what some criticised as a chaotic registration process.\nThere are some places where voting will not be able to take place at all because of rebel activity.\nThe perennial insecurity in the eastern provinces of Ituri, Nord Kivu and Sud Kivu has been a major campaign issue, with presidential candidates making lofty promises to end it.\nPolitical violence in the run-up to the polls has also been a source of concern.\nOn the eve of the vote, the European Union said it was worried about \"the hate speech, violence and incidents that have marked the last few days\". There have been some deadly incidents, causing Mr Katumbi to briefly suspend his campaign.\nPolls should be open for 11 hours from 06:00 local time (04:00 GMT in Goma; 05:00 GMT in Kinshasa). The electoral commission is expected to announce provisional results on 31 December."}

Historians believe members travelled through villages searching for troublemakers, including suspected sorcerers.\nThe 19th-Century wooden mask was probably acquired \"in unknown circumstances\" around 1917 by René-Victor Edward Maurice Fournier, a French colonial governor and the plaintiff's grandfather.\nIt was held in the family's possession until it was sold to the dealer. It was later resold at auction to an unknown buyer. \nThe couple had gone to court to claim a share of the proceeds of the sale, alleging the dealer had misled them about the true value of the mask. \nThe dealer denied knowing that it was so valuable and said he had demonstrated goodwill by offering the couple €300,000, the mask's initial valuation.\nHis lawyer argued that the couple had failed to research the item's true worth before selling it. \"When you've got such an item at home, you should be a bit more curious before giving it up,\" Patricia Pijot told French media.\nThe judge ruled in favour of the dealer and said the couple had failed to exercise due diligence in evaluating the \"historical and artistic\" value of the mask.\nThe offer was retracted after the couple sued.\nFrédéric Mansat Jaffré, lawyer for the couple, said: \"The judge has created a precedent... You or I will now need to ask a professional before then going to see another professional.\"\nGabon had separately requested that the sale of the mask be halted on the grounds that it rightfully belonged to the country. But the court also rejected that argument.\nThe West African country was a French colony at the time Fournier acquired the mask.\nTens of thousands of works of African art are held outside the continent. Most were removed during the colonial era, sometimes under disputed circumstances. \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has previously called for the restitution of African art. \n\"I cannot accept that a large part of the cultural heritage of several African countries is in France,\" he said in 2017."}

Now Wichian is back in Thailand, living in a small room in an industrial suburb south of Bangkok with his wife Malai.\nWhile he survived, three young Israeli men he met in captivity did not. They were mistakenly shot dead by Israeli soldiers.\nWichian had gone to Israel only in late September, driven like so many Thais from the poor north-east of the country to find better-paid work on Israeli farms. After nine days he was moved to an avocado orchard on the Kfar Aza kibbutz. He woke up on 7 October, his first morning there, to the sound of gunfire.\nHis fellow Thai workers assured him it was normal. But as the shooting got louder towards midday, they decided to lock themselves in one of the buildings. Before they could do that gunmen burst in, one holding a hand grenade. They started beating the Thais with their rifle butts.\n\"I crouched down like this and shouted 'Thailand, Thailand, Thailand', he said, showing how he pulled his arms over his head. \"But they kept beating me. All I could do was keep my face down. One guy stamped on me with his feet. I crawled under the bed to hide. I tried to text my wife to say I was being taken, but they dragged me out by my leg.\"\nWichian was eventually taken down into tunnels deep under Gaza, and would be kept there for 51 days. His was a lonely ordeal, because he was the only Thai, and he speaks no English, so could only communicate through drawings and hand gestures.\nConditions were grim. The hostages were fed just once a day; sometimes this was no more than a piece of bread and a dried date.\n\"When I was distressed they would come and talk to me, to calm me down, but I could not understand them. The only way I got by was by thinking of the faces of my children, my wife and my mother.\n\"When there was nothing else to do, I'd just sit against the wall and meditate. I kept thinking about the same thing over and over, which was that I had to survive.\"\nHe remembers the other hostages who were with him in the tunnels; three young Israeli men - Yotam, Sammy and Alon - who remained in captivity after his release, only to be shot dead by nervous Israeli soldiers as they came out, waving a white cloth, last Friday.\nHe had just seen the news, with their photographs, when we arrived to interview him.\n\"Every day my foreign friends and I tried to support each other. We would shake hands and do fist bumps. They would cheer me up by hugging me and clapping my shoulder. But we could only communicate by using our hands.\"\nHe found out that Yotam was a drummer, and Sammy loved riding his motorbike, and worked in a chicken farm. Wichian tried to teach them some Thai words. Wichian said two of the Israelis were in the tunnel with him from day one. The third joined them on 9 October.\nHe says he was treated leniently by his captors, but that in their first weeks underground two of the Israelis were sometimes beaten with electric cables.\n\"We were always hungry. We could only sip our water. A large bottle had to last four to five days, a smaller bottler for two days.\"\nHe really suffered from not being able to wash. They were allowed to sleep in the day, not at night. They were always damp - nothing dried in the tunnels.\nHe kept himself busy by trying to clean their living area. He even helped the Hamas guards move rubble that came into the tunnel after it was struck by a bomb.\nAfter a month the four hostages were moved to a new tunnel. \"At around 7pm they brought us up. But as soon as I saw it, my heart wanted to run back down to the tunnel.\n\"You could see bright lights everywhere from the aerial fighting. I heard drones flying all over the place, and the sound of gunfire. We had to run for 20 minutes, trying to avoid the drones.\"\nWichian says his captors encouraged him to count the days on a calendar, and even brought him a clock, because he kept asking them the time.\nThe end of his ordeal came suddenly. \"They came pointing to me and saying 'you, you go home, Thailand'.\" He saw daylight for the first time in 51 days, and was handed over to the Red Cross and driven over the border to Egypt.\n\"All the time I was down there I never shed a tear. But once I came up, and saw the two other released Thais, I hugged them and cried. We had a group hug and sat down with tears filling our eyes, asking ourselves how we could have survived.\n\"When I got back to Thailand they gave me a new name. They called me 'the survivor' and 'Mr Plenty of Fortune'.\"\nHowever, he still needs to pay back the substantial debt he incurred - around 230,000 Thai baht ($6,570; £5,180) - to cover the cost of his trip to Israel. He never had the chance to earn any money there.\nSo, like his wife, Wichian is taking a job in a factory. The salary is low - just 800 baht a day. They cannot save much. Their two children are living with their grandparents in their home province of Buri Ram.\nWichian sometimes has trouble sleeping, and wakes up calling for his mother. But, he says, he would go back to Israel, just for the chance to earn, and save, a little more."}

Israel's military described the footage as a \"criminal terror video\".\n\"It testifies to Hamas' cruelty towards innocent, very elderly civilians who are in need of medical care,\" said Daniel Hagari, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).\n\"The world must act in order to deliver medical aid and check on the state of the hostages. We are morally obliged to make every and all efforts in order to bring the hostages back home,\" the spokesman added.\nThe footage was released on the Telegram messaging app.\nThe hostages taken in October are believed to be held by Hamas and allied Palestinian groups.\nPrisoners of war and hostages are protected under international humanitarian law and so the BBC does not broadcast the full details of material which may have been filmed under duress.\nA spokesperson for Kibbutz Nir Oz, where the men were abducted from, urged US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, who is currently visiting Israel, to secure their release.\n\"We appreciate any sign of life from the hostages, but time is running out,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"The immediate release of all those abducted, through any potential negotiation avenue, is urgently required.\n\"Each passing day exacerbates their situation. Recent events sadly illustrate that the hostages' situation is deteriorating with each passing day, particularly for older individuals.\"\nAn estimated 240 hostages were taken to Gaza during Hamas's 7 October attacks that killed about 1,200 in southern Israel.\nIsrael has launched a massive retaliatory operation it says is aimed at destroying Hamas. More than 18,000 people have been killed in Gaza since, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, with hundreds of thousands displaced.\nDuring a six-day ceasefire at the end of November, 105 hostages were released in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails.\nOn Friday, three Israeli hostages mistakenly killed by Israeli soldiers in Gaza were shot dead while holding a white cloth, an Israeli military official said.\nThe hostages - Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 22, and Alon Shamriz, 26 - were killed in the Shejaiya neighbourhood of Gaza City.\nAccording to an Israeli military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the men emerged shirtless from a building, with one carrying a stick with a white cloth.\nOne of the soldiers, the official added, felt threatened, as the men were at a distance of tens of metres, declared them \"terrorists\" and opened fire. Two were immediately killed while the third, wounded, returned to the building.\nA cry for help was heard in Hebrew and the battalion commander ordered the troops to cease fire. The wounded hostage later re-emerged, and was shot and killed, the official said.\nIt is not clear if the hostages had been abandoned by their captors or escaped.\nAn IDF official said the case was \"against our rules of engagement\" and an investigation was happening at the \"highest level\".\nFamilies of the remaining hostages have urged the Israeli government to reach a new truce for at least some of the captives to be freed.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has deflected the calls, insisting \"military pressure is necessary both for the return of the hostages and for victory\".\nSpeaking to reporters on Monday, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby addressed rumours of a possible new hostage deal, and said talks were not at a point where an agreement was imminent."}

That includes 21.5% of refined oil and more than 13% of crude oil.\n\"Consumer goods will face the largest impact, though current disruptions are occurring during the off-peak shipping season,\" said Chris Rogers from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nOn Monday, one of the world's largest shipping firms said it would no longer carry Israeli cargo via the Red Sea.\nIn an update seen by the BBC, Evergreen Line, said: \"For the safety of ships and crew, Evergreen Line has decided to temporarily stop accepting Israeli cargo with immediate effect, and has instructed its container ships to suspend navigation through the Red Sea until further notice.\"\nThe Houthi rebels are targeting ships travelling through the Bab al-Mandab Strait - also known as the Gate of Tears - which is a channel 20 miles (32km) wide, and known for being perilous to navigate.\nThe rebels have declared their support for Hamas and have said they are targeting ships travelling to Israel, using drones and rockets against foreign-owned vessels.\nInstead of using the Bab al-Mandab Strait, ships will now have to take a longer route navigating around southern Africa, potentially adding about 10 days to the journey and costing millions of dollars.\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza following the 7 October attacks by Hamas that killed 1,200 people. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said more than 18,700 have been killed since the start of the war.\nIt is not clear if all the ships Houthi rebels have attacked were actually heading to Israel.\nIn the most recent reported assault, the owner of the MT Swan Atlantic said the ship was hit by an \"unidentified object\" on Monday while in the Red Sea off Yemen despite there being no links to Israel.\nInventor Chemical Tankers said: \"For the record, there is no Israeli link in the ownership (Norwegian), technical management (Singapore) of the vessel nor in any parts of the logistical chain for the cargo transported.\"\nAttacks on ships have intensified in recent days, leading to shipping firms suspending travel through the strait which sits between Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula and Djibouti and Eritrea on the African coast.\nIt is the route by which ships can reach the Suez Canal from the south - itself a major shipping lane.\nMaersk, the world's second-biggest shipping firm, described the situation as \"alarming\" on Friday after a \"near-miss\" incident involving Maersk Gibraltar and another attack on a container ship.\nIt was followed by Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), the world's largest shipping group, which said it would also divert its ships from the area.\nIts container ship, MSC PALATIUM III, was attacked on Friday as it was transiting the Red Sea. There were no injuries to the crew, but the ship has been taken out of service.\nCMA-CGM has also stopped shipments through the region, and Reuters has reported that Belgian oil tanker firm Euronav and Norway-based tanker group Frontline would both avoid Red Sea routes.\nOn Monday, Inventor Chemical Tankers confirmed that the MT Swan Atlantic was targeted while travelling from France to Réunion Island in the Indian Ocean.\nThe company said there were no injuries to its Indian crew, adding that the \"crew and the ship are now assisted by the US navy and will be brought to safety under protection by naval forces\".\nGermany's Hapag-Lloyd said it was re-routing several ships via the Cape of Good Hope, until passage through the Red Sea \"will be safe again for vessels and their crews\".\nEvergreen Line said that any container ships on longer journeys between Asia and the Mediterranean, Europe or the east coast of the US would also be diverted around the Cape of Good Hope.\nPeter Sand, chief analyst at freight rate data company Xeneta, said shipping firms would now be contacting customers to let them know that cargo was being delayed, adding that there was \"definitely a price to pay for a situation like this\".\nHe said the industry would also face knock-on effects such as higher insurance premiums, but he said that it was in a much better position to deal with an unfolding crisis than it was when the huge Ever Given ship blocked the Suez Canal in 2021, with Covid-related supply chain issues having eased up.\nSue Terpilowski of the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport also pointed out that in addition to extra fuel costs and time, the war-risk insurance costs are going up \"exponentially\", with customers facing higher prices being passed on to them too.\nAdditional reporting by Vivienne Nunis."}

The pain of taxes dominate everyday conversations, especially as the cost-of-living is rising.\nThey also say the taxes are only helping to fund extravagance in government rather than improve public services.\nThis perception has grown, especially after Kenya's Controller of Budget - an independent office that oversees the usage of public funds - recently raised concern over the high taxes amid \"wasteful\" spending, including on domestic and international travel by government officials.\nPresident Ruto, who has made over 40 trips abroad in about a year, has defended his travelling, saying he was seeking foreign investments and job opportunities for Kenyans.\nIn about the same time, 70,000 private-sector jobs have been lost amid a drastic rise in operating costs, and the closure of some businesses, according to the latest report by the Federation of Kenyan Employers (FKE).\nIt warns of the risk of more job losses, pointing out that 40% of employers are still considering scaling down their operations.\nFKE has called for the government to review taxes, but businessmen complain that the government is not listening.\nEconomist Ken Gichinga says Kenya has been discouraging business by placing a heavy tax burden on companies that are supposed to create jobs, make profits and boost government finances.\nIn the end, some firms relocate to other countries, people who were thinking of opening a small business like a restaurant drop the idea, while existing businesses are forced to go into the informal sector to avoid paying taxes - something that has already started happening.\nMike Muriuki, the director of a 10-year-old company that distributes and markets LPG gas cylinders, tells the BBC that tax hikes are suffocating his business.\nHe says ordinary people have no money to buy cooking gas - that has made his business shrink over the past year from orders of 700 cylinders daily to just about 200.\nMr Muriuki says this has forced him to lay off more than 70% of his workers, leaving him with just about 20.\nFor many small and medium-sized businesses like his, Mr Muriuki says, the impact of the taxes have been very burdensome - and the conduct of tax collectors has bordered on \"harassment\" in some cases.\nLast month, a Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) unit with paramilitary training visited one of his premises in Kiambu county, which borders the capital, Nairobi.\nThe tax agency's unit was deployed in September to enforce tax compliance.\nAt his premises, Mr Muriuki says, the tax officers asked for his sales and income records, including from mobile money transactions, as well as his tax returns. They also took pictures of the shop.\nIt was \"scary\", he tells the BBC.\n\"The manner they did it [can] put a lot of fear in businesspeople… People think these guys are coming to arrest us,\" Mr Muriuki adds.\nHe says people are \"now trying to find ways to hide what they are collecting\", including resorting to hard cash and directing mobile money payments to personal numbers rather than to business till accounts.\nAn owner of an auto spare parts shop in downtown Nairobi says he had stopped using his business till number amid higher transaction costs.\nThe gradual shift in the mode of payments has been the subject of recent social media discussion in Kenya, although data from the largest telecoms company Safaricom still shows a rise in mobile money transactions up to September.\nSince July, there has been a tax increase on monthly salaries from a maximum of 30% to 35%, a new 1.5% housing tax, a 2.75% hospital insurance fund levy, a 3% turnover (gross sales) tax on small businesses and a doubling of taxes on fuel to 16% - among other taxes.\nSome of the taxes, amid a rising cost of living, led to deadly street protests earlier in the year.\nThere has also been a steep increase in costs for obtaining identity cards, passports, birth, marriage and death documents.\nThe owner of a tour company founded in 2017 that mostly deals in outdoor adventure tells the BBC he is exasperated by the unfriendly business environment that he now finds himself in.\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity as he fears reprisals, he says higher taxes have reduced the ability of people to spend on things like travel, adding that everyone in the tourism sector is feeling the heat, but in different ways.\nFor him, the rapid decline of the value of the Kenyan shilling, even against currencies in the East African market, has made it impossible for him to plan in advance.\nHe complains that the Kenya Wildlife Service has decided to more than quadruple entrance fees to parks, yet \"there is no [extra] value that is being given\".\n\"Tourists ask me: 'What is happening in your country?',\" he tells the BBC, adding that Kenya is destroying its tourism market as people can get better deals in neighbouring Tanzania and Rwanda.\nIn the last couple of months, he has not organised any local tours - and has moved into other sectors, including farming, to survive.\nKRA, in a report on 11 December, says it has maintained an upward revenue growth since July, but it was below its annual target, as the increase in the price of oil had driven down demand for imports.\nIt acknowledged that demand for domestic goods and services had reduced, while also citing increase in lending rates and a reduction in banks' profitability.\nA fortnight ago, the treasury minister told MPs the country was finding it difficult to get money to pay civil servants' salaries as well as to give MPs' money for their constituency projects, which means there will be less development.\nWith such a gloomy picture, many Kenyans are hoping that Mr Ruto will offer them relief and climb down, just as Zaccheaus eventually did when he climbed down a tree after Jesus called him.\nYou may be interested in:"}

They weren't nurturing - it was the opposite of that.\"\nShe describes feeling like \"a bear trapped in a cage\" being pushed into \"even more hysterical states\".\nDetails of organisations offering information and support with eating disorders, mental health, or feelings of despair are available at BBC Action Line\nSiân's parents removed her from the school in 2019. Rick Mort told the BBC his daughter had been a shell of the person she once was. \n\"She was a very bubbly, confident, enthusiastic and talented girl when she went in. And she came out a wreck,\" he said.  \nSiân doesn't blame the school for developing an eating disorder, but does blame it for the way it was handled.\n\"Eating disorders are one of the most prevalent issues at ballet schools, and Elmhurst is supposed to be one of the best in the world - but they didn't seem to have any idea how to deal with mine,\" she says. \nElmhurst told the BBC it did not accept many of the assertions made.\nIt said no evidence had been found that staff had breached their position of trust and that they had \"acted in good faith to safeguard the health and well-being of the child concerned\".\nThe school said it could not comment on the details of the case given the duties of confidentiality involved.\nMadeleine Cunnah, 18, says her time at the London Vocational Ballet School (LVBS) left her close to suicide. \n\"One teacher would say things to me that were awful,\" says Madeleine who joined in 2017 age 11 and stayed at the school until she was 14. \n\"You sound like an elephant when you land, maybe if you were lighter, you would land lighter.\n\"You look like a bodybuilder.\"\nThe school has about 50 pupils and its mission statement is to prepare \"future stars\" for upper ballet school training. \nMadeleine says staff told her not to apply to go on to the prestigious Royal Ballet School, telling her: \"You won't get in because of your body shape.\"\nShe developed anorexia. \nShe blames LVBS for \"manipulating\" her \"young vulnerable mind\". \n\"Because when I [first] went to that school, I didn't think there was anything wrong with my body.\"\nShe says she believes the industry \"wants functioning anorexics who don't complain\". She says she didn't feel empowered to speak out while at the school and feared it would jeopardise her career.  \nStudies have shown ballet dancers are about three times more likely to have eating disorders than the general population. \nMadeleine won a place at Royal Ballet in 2021 when she was in the grip of her anorexia, which escalated she says, because the competitive environment among the students there normalised eating disorders. \n\"I knew I had to quit ballet or I was going to die,\" she says.  \nMadeleine hasn't danced since.\n\"It's left a deeply ingrained sense of worthlessness in me, which I fear will stay with me the rest of my life.\"  \nThe LVBS said it had no records of any complaints made by Madeleine or her family - and that it held material suggesting she'd had a positive experience overall at the school. \nIt added that an Ofsted report in 2017 concluded the school's work in promoting pupil development and welfare was \"outstanding\". \nSapphire Sumpter, 22, describes a teacher who would dig her nails into her flesh and say: \"I don't want to see your lunch.\" \nShe attended LVBS, then known as the YDA, until 2017 and developed an eating disorder within weeks of starting at the school, age 13. \nShe describes being regularly humiliated by certain staff, and says she was told she had \"deformed\" shoulders and would never be accepted into an upper school. \nThe former student says she was congratulated when she lost lots of weight as a result of developing pneumonia. \n\"Weight loss was always congratulated, even though we were all already thin.\"\nAbout the same time she says she suffered a serious injury in class, but wasn't allowed to see the physiotherapist or take a break from training.\nShe went on to train at Rambert School, but left classical ballet behind and is now a contemporary dancer and choreographer.\n\"It has taken me years to repair my relationship with my body and undo the physical and emotional damage from my time [at LVBS],\" she says. \nLVBS disputed Sapphire's claims, and said it held \"significant evidence to the contrary\" but could not discuss private information. \nIt said: \"We are very sorry to hear that a former pupil has suffered from ill health but the details presented to us by the BBC simply do not correspond with our own records. The welfare of our students is our highest priority.\" \nThe school again referred to its Ofsted inspection, which it said found that \"pupils are happy [and] are kept safe\" and that \"there is a strong, caring and nurturing ethos.\"\nJoe Tidswell, 25, says he was body-shamed about his physique by a ballet teacher at Elmhurst, contributing to him developing bulimia nervosa. \nHe says another staff member made \"completely inappropriate\" comments to his girlfriend about their sex life.\n\"This staff member would also intimidate girls who were suffering from eating disorders by calling them out of class to be weighed,\" he says.  \nHe graduated from the school in 2019 and describes it as a \"damaging environment for young people with mental health issues\".\nHe remains \"outraged\" at the bullying he says he witnessed from staff and experienced and believes some of the teachers were \"traumatised dancers themselves\".\n\"Some teachers didn't seem to have any idea how much their comments can stick in a young person's mind, sometimes for years,\" says Joe, who is now at medical school. \n\"When parents send their child to one of these [ballet] schools, they need to know what they're getting themselves into.\" \nElmhurst says it was not made aware of any complaints by Joe during his time there.\nIt added: \"The promotion of good physical and mental health is an absolute priority at Elmhurst Ballet School and we will always act immediately whenever issues are identified.\" \nThe school says it now employs a mental health nurse specialising in disordered eating and a \"further registered mental health nurse and a counsellor to ensure our students have all the support they need.\"\nFollowing an inspection in October, the school has been rated \"Outstanding\" by Ofsted. The inspection report states: \"Staff at all levels are highly skilled and knowledgeable.\"\nIn addition to the people who have contacted the BBC, Dino Nocivelli from Leigh Day solicitors says he has spoken to 180 former dancers who all say they have experienced bullying and body-shaming from staff at their old ballet schools.\nHe says his clients attended 12 different schools, including Elmhurst, the Royal Ballet School and LVBS. They are alleging mistreatment and calling for a formal inquiry into ballet schools. \nMr Nocivelli said: \"We need a culture change, but this can only be achieved when ballet accepts there is a problem and that it has to change.\"\nAdditional reporting by Hayley Hassall"}

Critics said the move hurt low-income Indians and hobbled India's sprawling informal economy where people mainly dealt in cash. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has consistently defended the move, saying that the currency ban had \"helped reduce black money (undeclared wealth), increase tax compliance and formalisation and given a boost to transparency\".\nBut seven years later, cash continues to hold ground, casting renewed doubt on the necessity of the controversial currency ban. According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), cash in circulation in the economy grew by over 16.6% in 2020-21 compared with average annual growth rate of 12.7% over the previous decade. The currency in circulation as a share of GDP - a common way to explain cash use in a country - peaked at over 14% in 2020-21, and moderated to 13% in 2021-22.\nAt the same time, digital transactions are also soaring, driven by expanding smartphone and debit card usage, and widespread delivery of welfare benefits.\nThis surge is led by the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), a platform facilitating seamless and near-instant account-to-account transfers through fintech apps. Last year, UPI transactions surpassed a trillion dollars, equivalent to a third of India's GDP. Powered by a remarkable 89 million transactions, India accounted for 46% of all global digital payments, according to ACI Worldwide and Global Data 2023.\nThe simultaneous growth of both cash and digital payments is widely referred to as a \"currency demand\" paradox. \"Since cash and digital modes are generally expected to substitute each other, the simultaneous rise in both seems counterintuitive,\" according to the RBI's latest annual report.\nWithdrawals from cash machines have diminished and cash velocity - the rate at which consumers and businesses exchange money in an economy - has slowed.\nBut for most Indians, cash continues to be a valuable \"precautionary\" financial saving - households stock cash for emergency purposes - and a store of value. The share of big denomination currency - 500 and 2,000-rupee notes - together accounted for more than 87% of the total value of banknotes in circulation as of 31 March, according to RBI. (In May, the highest denomination 2,000-rupee banknote, curiously introduced after the 2016 currency ban, was withdrawn by the central bank.)\nA pre-pandemic study found that cash held sway for minor purchases and digital means were preferred for larger transactions. A recent survey by LocalCircles, a community social media platform, found that most respondents preferred using cash for groceries, dining out, takeouts, hiring help, personal services, and home repairs.\nFalling interest rates on bank deposits, a large informal and rural economy, and expanded direct benefit cash transfers during the pandemic, may have contributed to the increased preference for cash, according to an RBI paper.\nThen there's politics and real estate.\nUnaccounted-for cash continues to pour into campaign coffers of political parties during elections. (Income tax officials recently found a staggering 3.5bn rupees - equivalent to $42m (£33m) - from premises linked to an opposition MP.) In 2018, Mr Modi's government introduced electoral bonds - time-limited and interest-free bonds in fixed denominations - ostensibly to flush out illicit cash and make political financing more transparent. Critics believe it has done the opposite - they say the bonds are cloaked in secrecy.\nThe bulk of the \"black money\" continues to be held in real estate. In its November survey, LocalCircles found that 76% of respondents who bought real estate in India in the last seven years used cash, with 15% paying more than half of the amount in cash. Only 24% indicated that they did not have to pay cash as against 30% of respondents two years ago. The significance of cash transactions in real estate is closely tied to developers' reliance on the support and favour of elected politicians, as a study by Devesh Kapur and Milan Vaishnav found.\nTo be sure, India is not an exception in experiencing concurrent growth in both digital currency and physical cash.\nIn a 2021 report, the European Central Bank spoke of a phenomenon called the \"paradox of banknotes\", noting that \"in recent years, the demand for euro banknotes has constantly increased while the use of banknotes for retail transactions seems to have decreased\". Despite the anticipated decline due to ongoing digitisation in retail payments, the report notes an unexpected trend: the demand for cash has not waned. In fact, the number of euro banknotes in circulation has consistently risen since 2007. Sweden, the most cashless society in the world, is a notable outlier.\nMeanwhile, for most Indians, cash will continue to remain the cornerstone of their daily existence. \"Most of my customers still pay fares in cash,\" says Atul Sharma, an auto-rickshaw driver in Delhi. \"Cash will never go away\".\nBBC News India is now on YouTube.

The 2010 eruption occurred under a glacier, which is not the case this time.\nProf Matthew Watson, Professor of Volcanoes and Climate at the University of Bristol, said \"it is unlikely, but not impossible'' that there may be some impact on air travel.\n''This type of eruption doesn't generally produce much ash, which is what tends to ground planes,'' he said. \nThe  Eyjafjallajökull eruption led to large amounts of water interacting with molten rock causing an explosive reaction - like water being put into a chip pan, but immensely more powerful.\nThe explosions of 2010 led to the molten rock being turned into ash and glassy particles, which scientists feared would damage jet engines. The issue was compounded by the fact that the ash cloud flew straight into the part of an air current known as the jet stream that spread it across western Europe.\nThe dangers posed by the eruption on Iceland's Reykjanes peninsula are local, according to volcanologist Dr Sam Mitchell of Bristol University. \n\"It is completely valid for people to think back to 2010 and the impact caused across Europe, especially to air travel,\" he said.\n\"The difference this time is that the volcano is not erupting explosively with water. So people should not worry about the airspace over Europe because the current eruption is nothing like what happened with Eyjafjallajökull.\"\nDr Mitchell said that the greatest risk to people living locally was from volcanic fumes which, although not dangerous, would be uncomfortable, especially to those with respiratory problems.\nDr Matt Genge, Senior Lecturer in Earth and Planetary Science at Imperial College London, said that it was unclear how the  Reykjanes eruption would progress.\n''The eruption rate at these fractures is large, at a hundred cubic metres of lava per second,\" he said. \"The lava appears to be hot and fluid making the lava flows very mobile and dangerous to approach.\"\nHe said that whether the eruption posed a threat to the Blue Lagoon thermal tourist attraction and to the town of Grindavik depended very much on topography. \n\"Lava flows downhill until it cools sufficiently to stop, there is little that can be done to divert it,\" he said. \nHe said the eruption may continue to expand along the fissure, extending the area that the lava can envelope.\nFollow Pallab on X, formally known as Twitter."}

That includes 21.5% of refined oil and more than 13% of crude oil.\nBut it is not just about oil. Container ships carry all sorts of consumer goods seen in the shops including TVs, clothes, trainers and sports equipment.\nIt is inevitable that supply chains will be affected due to ships being diverted away from the Red Sea, but consumer goods \"will face the largest impact\", according to Chris Rogers, head of supply chain research at S&P Global Market Intelligence, though he does note the current disruption has occurred \"during the off-peak shipping season\".\nDelays to products reaching shops can be expected, with container ship journeys expected to take at least 10 days longer due to the Cape of Good Hope route adding about 3,500 nautical miles.\nThe extra distance will also cost companies more. Shipping rates have risen 4% in the past week and those costs could be passed on by businesses to customers.\nHowever, rates still remain much lower than last year, and are far below the levels seen in 2021, when freight charges soared in line with demand as Covid restrictions were eased.\nThere are also fears the disruption could push up oil prices.\nA rise in oil prices, a key ingredient in car fuel, can lead to higher prices at the pumps and also drive higher inflation. Inflation, which measures the pace of price rises, has been falling in the UK and is currently 4.6%.\nWhen it comes to shipments of LNG being disrupted, even if wholesale energy prices rise, any increases would not feed through to domestic bills until April 2024 at the earliest.\nThis is because the energy price cap, which limits the amount suppliers can charge, has already been set for January. \nIs moving freight by sea the only option? Mr Rogers says transporting goods by rail instead would require \"crossing Russia\", which is under economic sanctions due to invading Ukraine, while \"trucking from the Gulf to Israel may only offset around 3% of shipping\".\nThe attacks have led the US to launch an international naval operation to protect ships in the Red Sea route, and countries including the UK, Canada, France, Bahrain, Norway and Spain have joined.\nUS defence secretary Lloyd Austin held a virtual meeting with ministers from more than 40 countries on Tuesday, and called on more nations to contribute to efforts to keep shipping safe in the region.\nBut some shipping companies are reluctant to immediately start using the route again despite increased security. \nMaersk and Hapag-Lloyd, which have both have ships that have been attacked by Houthi rebels, welcomed the extra measures but said it is difficult to determine when they would go back to using the Red Sea, meaning there could be disruption for some time."}

The share of big denomination currency - 500 and 2,000-rupee notes - together accounted for more than 87% of the total value of banknotes in circulation as of 31 March, according to RBI. (In May, the highest denomination 2,000-rupee banknote, curiously introduced after the 2016 currency ban, was withdrawn by the central bank.)\nA pre-pandemic study found that cash held sway for minor purchases and digital means were preferred for larger transactions. A recent survey by LocalCircles, a community social media platform, found that most respondents preferred using cash for groceries, dining out, takeouts, hiring help, personal services, and home repairs.\nFalling interest rates on bank deposits, a large informal and rural economy, and expanded direct benefit cash transfers during the pandemic, may have contributed to the increased preference for cash, according to an RBI paper.\nThen there's politics and real estate.\nUnaccounted-for cash continues to pour into campaign coffers of political parties during elections. (Income tax officials recently found a staggering 3.5bn rupees - equivalent to $42m (£33m) - from premises linked to an opposition MP.) In 2018, Mr Modi's government introduced electoral bonds - time-limited and interest-free bonds in fixed denominations - ostensibly to flush out illicit cash and make political financing more transparent. Critics believe it has done the opposite - they say the bonds are cloaked in secrecy.\nThe bulk of the \"black money\" continues to be held in real estate. In its November survey, LocalCircles found that 76% of respondents who bought real estate in India in the last seven years used cash, with 15% paying more than half of the amount in cash. Only 24% indicated that they did not have to pay cash as against 30% of respondents two years ago. The significance of cash transactions in real estate is closely tied to developers' reliance on the support and favour of elected politicians, as a study by Devesh Kapur and Milan Vaishnav found.\nTo be sure, India is not an exception in experiencing concurrent growth in both digital currency and physical cash.\nIn a 2021 report, the European Central Bank spoke of a phenomenon called the \"paradox of banknotes\", noting that \"in recent years, the demand for euro banknotes has constantly increased while the use of banknotes for retail transactions seems to have decreased\". Despite the anticipated decline due to ongoing digitisation in retail payments, the report notes an unexpected trend: the demand for cash has not waned. In fact, the number of euro banknotes in circulation has consistently risen since 2007. Sweden, the most cashless society in the world, is a notable outlier.\nMeanwhile, for most Indians, cash will continue to remain the cornerstone of their daily existence. \"Most of my customers still pay fares in cash,\" says Atul Sharma, an auto-rickshaw driver in Delhi. \"Cash will never go away\".\nBBC News India is now on YouTube.

We are mindful of the magnitude and weight of the questions now before us.\n\"We are likewise mindful of our solemn duty to apply the law, without fear or favor, and without being swayed by public reaction to the decisions that the law mandates we reach.\"\nThe decision reverses an earlier one from a Colorado judge, who ruled that the 14th Amendment's insurrection ban did not apply to presidents because the section does not explicitly name them.\nThat same lower court judge also found that Mr Trump had participated in an insurrection in the 2021 US Capitol riot. His supporters stormed Congress on that day while lawmakers were certifying President Joe Biden's election victory.\nThe Colorado Supreme Court's decision does not go into effect until at least 4 January 2024. That is the eve of the deadline for the state to print its presidential primary ballots.\nIn a statement, Steven Cheung, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, called the ruling \"completely flawed\" and lambasted the justices, who were all appointed by Democratic governors.\n\"Democrat Party leaders are in a state of paranoia over the growing, dominant lead President Trump has amassed in the polls,\" Mr Cheung said.\n\"They have lost faith in the failed Biden presidency and are now doing everything they can to stop the American voters from throwing them out of office next November.\"\nMr Cheung added that Mr Trump's legal team would \"swiftly file an appeal\" to the US Supreme Court, where conservatives hold a 6 to 3 majority.\nRepresentatives for Mr Biden's re-election campaign declined to comment on the Colorado ruling. But a senior Democrat affiliated with the campaign told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that the decision would help Democrats by supporting their argument that the US Capitol riot was an attempted insurrection.\nThe source said it would also aid Democrats in showcasing \"the stark differences\" between Mr Trump and Mr Biden.\nRepublican lawmakers condemned the decision, including House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, who called it \"a thinly veiled partisan attack\".\n\"Regardless of political affiliation, every citizen registered to vote should not be denied the right to support our former president and the individual who is the leader in every poll of the Republican primary,\" he said.\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), the group that brought the case, welcomed the ruling.\n\"It is not only historic and justified, but is necessary to protect the future of democracy in our country,\" the group's president, Noah Bookbinder, said in a statement.\nSimilar lawsuits in New Hampshire, Minnesota and Michigan have failed.\nThe 14th Amendment was ratified after the American Civil War. Section 3 was intended to block secessionists from returning to previous government roles once southern states re-joined the Union.\nIt was used against Confederate president Jefferson Davis and his vice-president Alexander Stephens, both of whom had served in Congress. It has seldom been invoked since.\nMr Trump lost the state of Colorado by a wide margin in the last presidential election. But if courts in more competitive states followed suit on Tuesday's ruling, Mr Trump's White House bid could face serious problems.\nDuring a one-week trial in Colorado last month, the former president's lawyers argued he should not be disqualified because he did not bear responsibility for the US Capitol riot.\nBut in its Tuesday ruling, the Colorado Supreme Court majority disagreed.\nThey said Mr Trump's messages before the riot were \"a call to his supporters to fight and… his supporters responded to that call\".\nCarlos Samour, one of three justices who dissented, argued the government could not \"deprive someone of the right to hold public office without due process of law\".\n\"Even if we are convinced that a candidate committed horrible acts in the past - dare I say, engaged in insurrection - there must be procedural due process before we can declare that individual disqualified from holding public office,\" he wrote.\nMr Trump is facing four criminal cases, including one federal and one state case in Georgia related to his alleged election subversion efforts."}

They were shot, strangled or stabbed to death.\nShortly before the jury in Paris retired to consider her role in the crimes, Olivier expressed regret and asked for forgiveness from her victims' families.\nShe told the court: \"I regret everything I did and I ask for forgiveness from the families of the victims, while knowing that it is unforgivable.\"\nDuring sentencing on Tuesday, the court was told Estelle Mouzin was coming home from school at 6pm, but that she never made it.\nHer body has never been found.\nOlivier was questioned for hundreds of hours in 2019, and accepted Fourniret had left for France, looking for a young girl to rape.\nThe court heard she knew he had \"gone hunting\".\nDuring sentencing, President of the court Didier Safar said: \"This is about the extreme gravity of the facts that contributed to the death of two young women, and a nine-year-old girl, in inhumane circumstances.\n\"Monique Olivier had no empathy for her victims, who she dehumanised.\"\nMost of Fourniret's victims were killed in the Ardennes region of northern France and in Belgium.\nLanguages student Miss Parrish had moved from Newnham-on-Severn in Gloucestershire, to Auxerre in France in 1990 for part of her university course.\nBut after posting an advert offering English lessons, she was murdered by Fourniret.\nHer body was found in the Yonne River on 17 May. She had been raped, beaten and strangled.\nMr Seban said he hoped this trial would start a new chapter in French justice, adding: \"For the Parrish family, it has been hard.\n\"They've waited more than 30 years for this trial. They led the charge, coming every year to Auxerre to show their drive to get this done.\n\"Their dignity throughout… there hasn't been an angry word, a cry or a desire of vengeance. It's been a desire for justice.\"\nMr Parrish said: \"After this last obstacle in our struggle to gain an element of justice for Joanna, we can remember our daughter and sister with a smile on our faces.\"\nEstelle's father Eric Mouzin said: \"The suffering of all the victims must have a purpose against the evil we've seen.\"\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.

This week, representatives of both the White House and the State Department said the US was planning one more military aid package to Ukraine - but that it had limited ability to send more help after that unless Congress acted. \nThe US setback was followed by Hungary's blocking of the EU's €50bn ($55bn; £43bn) financial aid deal last week.

But he admitted that the armed forces had problems with air defence systems and communication, and needed to increase the production of drones.\nPresident Zelensky's end-of-year news conference was held in the Ukrainian capital on Tuesday, with the time and venue being kept secret from the general public. Invited Ukrainian and foreign media had been given the details in their confirmation letters.\nAppearing in his trademark military-style clothes, the Ukrainian leader was asked a wide range of questions during the two-hour event.\nHe revealed that Ukraine's top military commanders had \"proposed to mobilise an additional 450,000-500,000 individuals\" for the country's war effort.\nHe said this was a \"very serious number\" and he needed more in-depth discussion before committing to the plan.\n\"I need specifics: what will happen to the million-strong army of Ukraine, what will happen to those guys who have been defending our state for two years? We have issues of rotation and holidays. It should be a comprehensive plan.\"\nBut he ruled out any proposals to mobilise women.\nWhen asked by the BBC's Jessica Parker about whether Ukraine could be on the cusp of starting to lose the war, Mr Zelensky was firm. \"No,\" was the answer.\nIt's the answer you would expect, but he's not alone in expressing this kind of determination, our correspondent in Kyiv says. Many people she has met will not countenance anything other than beating back their Russian invaders, she adds.  \nDuring the briefing, Mr Zelensky also said that:\nDuring the whole event, the Ukrainian president sought to strike a confident note - but sometimes he appeared to be tense and tetchy when pressed over reports of corruption among Ukrainian government officials and lawmakers."}

It was later resold at auction to an unknown buyer. \nThe couple had gone to court to claim a share of the proceeds of the sale, alleging the dealer had misled them about the true value of the mask. \nThe dealer denied knowing that it was so valuable and said he had demonstrated goodwill by offering the couple €300,000, the mask's initial valuation.\nHis lawyer argued that the couple had failed to research the item's true worth before selling it. \"When you've got such an item at home, you should be a bit more curious before giving it up,\" Patricia Pijot told French media.\nThe judge ruled in favour of the dealer and said the couple had failed to exercise due diligence in evaluating the \"historical and artistic\" value of the mask.\nThe offer was retracted after the couple sued.\nFrédéric Mansat Jaffré, lawyer for the couple, said: \"The judge has created a precedent...

He was buried by himself without any personal possessions in a ditch, so there was little to go on to establish his identity.\nDr Marina Silva of the Ancient Genomics Laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute, in London, extracted and decoded Offord's ancient DNA from a tiny bone taken from his inner ear, which was the best preserved part of the entire skeleton. \n\"This is not like testing the DNA of someone who is alive,\" she explained. \n\"The DNA is very fragmented and damaged. However, we were able to (decode) enough of it.\n\"The first thing we saw was that genetically he was very different to the other Romano-British individuals studied so far.\" \nThe latest ancient DNA analysis methods are now able to flesh out the human stories behind events that, until recently, have been reconstructed only by documents and archaeological evidence.\nThese largely tell the tales of the wealthy and powerful.\nThe latest research is a detective story which uses cutting edge forensic science to unravel the mystery of an ordinary person - a  young man buried in a ditch in Cambridgeshire between 126 and 228 AD, during the Roman occupation of Britain.\nAt first, archaeologists thought Offord to be an unremarkable discovery of a local man. But DNA analysis at Dr Silva's lab showed that he was from the furthest reaches of the Roman Empire, an area that is currently southern Russia, Armenia, and Ukraine.\nThe analysis showed him to be a Sarmatian, who are Iranian-speaking people, renowned for their horse-riding skills.\nSo how did he end up in a sleepy backwater of the empire so far from home?\nTo find the answers, a team from the archaeology department of Durham University used another exciting analysis technique to examine his fossilised teeth, which have chemical traces of what he ate. \nTeeth develop over time, so just like tree rings, each layer records a snapshot of the chemicals that surrounded them at that moment in time.\nThe analysis showed that until the age of six he ate millets and sorghum grains, known scientifically as C4 crops, which are plentiful in the region where Sarmatians were known to have lived. \nBut over time, analysis showed a gradual decrease in his consumption of these grains and more wheat, found in western Europe, according to Prof Janet Montgomery.\n\"The (analysis) tells us that he, and not his ancestors, made the journey to Britain. As he grew up, he migrated west, and these plants disappeared from his diet.\" \nHistorical records indicate that Offord could have been a cavalry man's son, or possibly his slave. They show that around the time he lived, a unit of the Sarmatian cavalry incorporated into the Roman army was posted to Britain.\nThe DNA evidence confirms this picture, according to Dr Alex Smith of MOLA Headland Infrastructure, the company that led the excavation.\n\"This is the first biological evidence,\" he told BBC News.\n\"The availability of these DNA and chemical analysis techniques means that we can now ask different questions and look at how societies formed, their make-up and how they evolved in the Roman period. \n\"It suggests that there was much greater movement, not just in the cities but also the countryside.\"\nDr Pontus Skoglund, who heads the ancient genomics laboratory at the Crick, told BBC News that the new technology is transforming our understanding of the past.\n\"The main impact of ancient DNA to date has been improving our understanding of the Stone and Bronze Ages, but with better techniques, we are also starting to transform our understanding of the Roman and later periods.\"\nThe details have been published in the journal, Current Biology.\nFollow Pallab on X, formally known as Twitter."}

Since late October, the region around Reykjavik has been experiencing an increase in earthquake activity. \nThe eruption can be seen from Reykjavik, which is about 42km north-east of Grindavik.\nAn eyewitness in the capital told the BBC that half of the sky in the direction of the town was \"lit up in red\" from the eruption, and smoke could be seen billowing into the air.\nOn Tuesday, British tourists Amrit and Peter, a married couple in their 20s, took selfies with the bright orange lava in the background.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Peter said: \"We are not scared at all, the Icelandic authorities are handling this well and keep giving us information. We feel totally safe.\" \nIn 2010, a volcanic eruption caused an ash plume to rise several kilometres into the atmosphere, leading to several days of air travel disruption in Europe.\nVolcanologist Dr Evgenia Ilyinskaya told the BBC that there would not be the same level of disruption as 2010, as these volcanoes in south-west Iceland were \"physically not able to generate the same ash clouds\". \nSpeaking from Iceland, Dr Ilyinskaya, associate professor of volcanology at Leeds University, said local people had been both \"fearing and waiting for\" the volcano to erupt.\nShe added that authorities were preparing for potential lava flows that could destroy homes and infrastructure, including the Blue Lagoon, a popular tourist destination. \n\"At the moment it seems not to be threatening, although it remains to be seen,\" she said.\nThe Icelandic Met Office said at 12:30 GMT on Tuesday that the power of the eruption was decreasing, but that gases from the volcano could still reach Reykjavik. \nAoalheiour Halldorsdottir, who lives in Sandgeroi - about 20km from Grindavik - said she had seen the eruption from her home. \n\"It was crazy to see it with my own eyes. We have had volcano explosions before, but this was the first time I got really scared,\" she told BBC News. \n\"We're used to volcanoes [erupting], but this was crazy.\" \nShe said there was some \"panic\" on Monday night, and that she had bought extra supplies of water, but that things had largely returned to normal on Tuesday. \n\"I'm at work now and I can still see it. I can see the lights in the sky,\" she said. \nHans Vera was evacuated from Grindavik last month, but hoped before Monday's eruption to return home for Christmas. \nBut he said: \"I don't see that in the future they will let people get close to Grindavik - so we are back in the waiting game.\" \nIceland's foreign minister, Bjarni Benediktsson said on X, formerly Twitter, that \"there are no disruptions to flights to and from Iceland, and international flight corridors remain open\". \n\"The jets [of lava] are quite high, so it appears to be a powerful eruption at the beginning,\" he said.\nImages and videos posted on social media showed lava bursting from the volcano just an hour after an earthquake swarm - a series of seismic events - was detected.\nPolice have warned people to stay away from the area.\nThe length of the crack in the volcano is about 3.5km, with the lava flowing at a rate of around 100 to 200 cubic metres per second, the Met Office said, adding that this was many times more than recent eruptions on the Reykjanes peninsula. \nIceland's Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir said defences recently constructed would have a positive effect.\nShe said her thoughts were with the local community and she was hoping for the best despite the \"significant event\".\nPresident Gudni Johannesson said safeguarding lives was the main priority but that every effort would be made to protect structures too.\nAre you in Iceland?

He was found not guilty of two further charges.\nMajors' career had been on the rise since he broke through in acclaimed 2019 drama The Last Black Man in San Francisco, before going on to star in Netflix western The Harder They Fall.\nHe also appeared in Spike Lee's war drama film Da 5 Bloods, earned an Emmy nomination for HBO's Lovecraft Country, and played Michael B Jordan's adversary in boxing sequel Creed III earlier this year.\nAnd he was hotly tipped for an Oscar nomination after playing an amateur bodybuilder in another drama, Magazine Dreams, following its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year - but its release was delayed after his arrest.\nMarvel Studios recruited the actor to play variants of the mighty multiverse-spanning Kang in Disney+ series Loki, and he made his big-screen Marvel debut in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.\nThose who stayed for the credits will have seen how that film teased future storylines for Kang - or many versions of Kang.\n\"Kang was the new 'big bad' that they were setting up for the MCU after Thanos,\" explains Alvin Addo-Quaye, who runs Big A movie and pop culture reviews on TikTok. \"They were really setting him up for the future Avengers movies.\"\nThe name of Majors' character is even in the title of Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, which is slated for release in 2026; and he was due to have a major part in Avengers: Secret Wars, which is scheduled for 2027.\n\"Marvel had more riding on Jonathan Majors than perhaps any other actor,\" according to the Associated Press's film writer Jake Coyle. \"Now it's parting ways with him, and throwing years of plans for its cinematic universe in disarray.\"\nRolling Stone magazine's Alan Sepinwall wrote: \"It's not tenable to build the next phase of a mega-billions franchise around an actor whose criminal history will dominate the press cycle for each film.\"\nEven before the verdict, there were already reports that Marvel did not \"see a path to how they move forward\" with Majors.\nWhile Majors maintained his innocence, Ms Jabbari's testimony - along with text messages revealing a previous injury and Majors calling himself a \"monster\", and audio of him talking of his \"temper\" and that he was a \"great man\" - meant his reputation had suffered serious damage.\nMarvel's decision to dump him comes as the studio is seeking to re-establish itself as the all-conquering blockbuster machine following a string of lukewarm performances.\nThe studio's latest release, The Marvels, recorded its lowest box office opening, and once-enthusiastic audiences have been diagnosed with a condition dubbed \"superhero fatigue\".\nSo the company could take Majors' departure as a moment to overhaul its plans and kick-start a change in direction.\nAvengers: The Kang Dynasty has not started filming and lost director Destin Daniel Cretton last month, with Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness writer Michael Waldron recently coming on board to rework the story.\nThe film could move away from the Kang character and pivot to a different antagonist, with other supervillain storylines such as Doctor Doom yet to be explored in the MCU.\nHowever, Marvel may not be so willing to part from the Kang storyline quite so easily, with half a decade's worth of projects based around the character.\nThat leaves them with the option to replace Majors with a different actor - which is not unprecedented in the Marvel universe.\nMark Ruffalo took over as Bruce Banner and The Hulk after Edward Norton left the MCU citing creative differences; and Don Cheadle stepped in as Colonel James Rhodes after Terrance Howard left the cast because of pay disputes.\n\"Their options are recast, or leave what they have done and and introduce a new villain, but that's going to take a lot of time,\" Addo-Quaye says.\n\"I personally would prefer recast. Even though we've only seen Jonathan Majors play Kang and the various different versions of Kang, I would still be fine for another actor to take on the role because you can you can suspend your disbelief.\n\"It's a comic book movie at the end of the day. I think doing a new villain is too much of a long haul.\"\nFor Majors himself, the solution is perhaps less simple.\nThese were misdemeanour charges, and he faces up to a year in jail or probation when he's sentenced in February.\nOther actors have come back from similar situations after time and repentance, with independent films more likely to offer him a route than big studios.\nOne of Hollywood's most promising talents is unlikely to return to the same heights, and he is the only one to blame."}
