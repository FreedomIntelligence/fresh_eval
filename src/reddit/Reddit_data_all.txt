Title: Girlfriend left
Content: First time posting, in a bit of a horrendous situation and I need advice. I’ve been with my girlfriend for nearly 7 years, well I was. She left saying she felt like she didn’t want to be close to me or kiss me etc, a bit of background on it, this was not an ongoing thing, it was in my eyes a very swift change and she even admits that herself, I think she has been suffering from mental issues which I don’t really want to get into as it’s her business, she also came off the pill after being on it for a decade non stop, this situation coincides with her coming off it. We have a beautiful relationship and I love her more than anything on earth, I never seen this coming and neither did she so she says. We have travelled the world together, lived in a caravan while travelling and rarely even argued or anything like that, we have always had a blissful relationship full of love and fxck all issues if I’m honest. She’s extremely upset over this as am I obviously. I want to do whatever I can to move through this, I will fight for her until I truly know it’s done, I’m not ready to walk away from her, I won’t do it unless she says she is done. I just need advice, because In my opinion I think coming off the pill has completely destroyed her hormones. She has not been the same person since coming off it, I think she now has rocd towards our relationship and she is such a soft person that she cannot escape it or handle it. I’m not sure what else to say , I know in the core of my body we are meant to be together, we would always talk almost daily about the kids we will have, getting married, our lives together, but now she says she pretty much sees me as a friend. I am honestly at my wits end. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated. Don’t be afraid to be honest. I can handle it, I just don’t want to accept that this could happen so quick, after so long. It doesn’t make sense to me.

Title: Streak ends with new Watch?
Content: Hey there,

unfortunately I‘ve found a lot of different opinions for this, so I wanted to ask ya‘ll for help.

My beloved Series 4 may have just given up, so I‘d Switch so a SE.
My buddy had the same issue like a year ago and his streak would’ve ended but he found a way to continue it, but for that the Watch has to be on, which is an issue for my case.

But there were people on here saying the streak just continues - so was there an Update for this? Can I just buy a new Watch?

Wouldn’t want to end my streak of 1300+ days

Thank you in advance

Title: Hard Rock Band Seeks Vocalist (Madison, WI)
Content: APHELION is a hard rock band based in Madison, WI. We are currently seeking a VOCALIST to complete our line up. This is a serious, goal-orientated project with a professional attitude.

We seek a like-minded, reliable, and skilled individual who can front the band at a professional level. Preferred range would be a baritone who can handle clean and harsh vocals. We desire someone who requires minimal production and sounds good live. It would be appreciated if you could provide audio samples of yourself in advance.

Our debut album 𝘊𝘩𝘢𝘴𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘚𝘶𝘯 was released in January 2020. The lead single, "I've Lost the Moon" went to rock radio and received airplay worldwide. Due to the Covid pandemic shutting down the industry, all plans to perform were postponed. In the summer of 2020, we parted ways with our singer who was a PR reliability on social media.

We rehearse in a private, climate-controlled and keyed-entry studio near the Beltline on Park Street. New songs are currently being demoed as well.

The band utilizes a closed In-Ear Monitor System. Housed in an Odyssey brand combo rack, it features a PreSonus mixer, six individual in-ear monitor channels on Xtuga IEM systems, two Shure GLX-D/SM58 wireless vocal mics, and a Tech 21 SansAmp with Korg tuner for the bass rig. The guitars run into this via dual Line 6 floor processor pedals. We also have three NUX wireless guitar systems. Generic in-ear monitor headphones are provided, or you may bring your own (recommended).
