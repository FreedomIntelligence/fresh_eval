The former president is claiming he is immune from prosecution because he was acting in his official capacity as president before and during the riot.\nIn court filings, Mr Smith argued the Supreme Court should consider the case because it presented \"a fundamental question at the heart of our democracy: whether a former president is absolutely immune\" from being prosecuted for federal crimes allegedly committed while in the White House.\n\"The United States recognizes that this is an extraordinary request,\" he added. \"This is an extraordinary case.\"\nIn a post on his social media site, Truth Social, Mr Trump said the Supreme Court had rejected a \"desperate attempt to short circuit our Great Constitution\", adding that he was \"entitled to Presidential Immunity\".\nMr Trump's lawyers had argued the request to expedite the trial was politically motivated, claiming in court filings that it was part of an effort to \"ensure that President Trump - the leading Republican candidate for President, and the greatest electoral threat to President Biden - will face a months-long criminal trial at the height of his presidential campaign\".\nThe ruling means the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit will have to hear the case before it can be appealed to the Supreme Court. It is expected that the US's highest court will eventually have to issue a ruling.\nThe appeals process may delay the start date of the trial, however, which prosecutors had hoped to hold before the election.\nThe concern for prosecutors is that the closer it gets to election day, the more mired in politics the case becomes. And if Mr Trump's attorneys succeed in pushing the date past the election the trial could be delayed indefinitely.\nThe possibility also looms that, with pressure from a newly inaugurated President Trump, a delayed case could be dropped entirely.\n\"Trump's delay strategy appears to be working,\" Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia, told the BBC.\n\"All of [this] will consume time, and, thus, complicate efforts to start the trial before Judge Chutkan on the early March date.\"\nThe appeal comes after Judge Chutkan had previously rejected Mr Trump's immunity claims, writing in a ruling that the former president's \"four-year service as Commander in Chief did not bestow on him the divine right of kings to evade the criminal accountability that governs his fellow citizens\".\nIn the meantime, however, arguments are set to be heard in the case in DC Circuit Court on 9 January.\nMr Trump currently faces dozens of criminal charges across four cases, including two related to his alleged election subversion efforts.\nFriday's decision by the high court suggests that its nine justices are reluctant to insert themselves into Mr Trump's ongoing legal drama if at all possible.\nThat may hint at how the court handles some of the numerous high-profile legal challenges involving Mr Trump that will end up on the court's doorstep in the coming months.\nThe former president faces other charges in Florida, also brought by Mr Smith, for his handling of classified documents.\nThe decision on Friday also comes after the Colorado Supreme Court ruled earlier this week that Mr Trump could no longer appear on the state's 2024 Republican primary ballot because of a constitutional insurrection clause.\nThe justices ruled Mr Trump was ineligible as a candidate because of his actions related to the Capitol riots.\nThe former president has appealed that case to the US Supreme Court."}

She's worked on this production line since 1978. \nShe effortlessly blows glass baubles using a gas burner fixed to her desk. It's a welcome source of heat in these cold, industrial surroundings. \nAfter years of shrinking output, this factory stopped completely when Russian forces occupied this area for a month soon after the start of the country's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. \n\"It was very scary when tanks drove down the street,\" Henya, another worker, explains. \"We couldn't go outside. We had no information, we were cut off from the world. It was terrible.\"\nAnd yet, despite only a third of the team having returned, decorations are still being made. Small pieces of Christmas cheer are carefully built and sent out around the country. \nAnd what is Henya's wish for Ukrainians living under Russian occupation this Christmas?\n\"You have to believe, hope - and liberation will happen, it will be like that.\" \nHenya works on the more artistic part of the process: she and her colleagues caringly hand paint each individual bauble. \nYou immediately notice a military theme. Miniature soldiers, MIG fighter jets, even a Ukrainian tractor pulling a Russian tank - all hang from a shelf, destined for a Christmas tree. \n\"I think that everyone who will take a look at such a bauble will hope for the victory of our country sooner,\" says Tamila with a defiant tone now typical here in Ukraine.\nUkraine and Russia share countless cultural ties, and they will always have to live next to each other. Yet the former's identity is only being strengthened by the latter's aggression. \nFewer places know that aggression better than the town of Bucha, a couple of miles from the decoration factory. \nAs the Russian advance towards Kyiv slowed last year, invading troops were accused of killing more than 500 civilians in one of the worst atrocities of the war so far. \nSome of their names appear on a silver memorial next to the Church of St Andrew. As its golden domes glisten in the winter sunshine, you can still see where grass has struggled to regrow. \nIt was here that a mass grave appeared during Russia's occupation. The bodies of those who died could only be exhumed after they retreated. \n\"Unfortunately for many people in the world, Ukraine is linked to Russia. And Ukraine is always viewed in the context of being a neighbour of Russia,\" explains Father Andriy in the candlelit crypt of St Andrew's. \n\"But I think that we are more a neighbour of Europe,\" he says. \"And the fact that we've now changed the calendar is not shifting away from Russia. It is us returning back to Europe, where we belong.\"\nGiven Russia will always be close by, I ask whether he could ever forgive the invading country for what it's done to his homeland.\n\"God forgives a sinner, but only those who repent. We do not see yet that the Russians are trying to repent for their sins and mistakes, so I think it's too early to talk about forgiveness.\"\nFor Ukraine, any Russian repentance must start with an end of its ongoing invasion. There is still no sign of that happening.\nAdditional reporting by Hanna Chornous, Vicky Riddell and Anastasiia Levchenko"}

Islamic Jihad, a smaller group in the Gaza Strip, is among those known to also be holding Israeli hostages.\nThe Hamas statement puts the Israeli government in a very difficult position. \nIt has said it thinks the best way to get the release of hostages is military pressure on Hamas and by staging rescue operations.\nBut so far that approach has not really worked. Only one hostage - Ori Megidish - has actually been rescued. \nThe government is also under huge pressure from the relatives of the hostages still being held, with some telling it the strategy of force is not working.\nHamas is putting pressure on Israel to stop the war altogether but without any guarantee that the group is going to stop its armed actions.\nSo the Israeli government is extremely reluctant to stop fighting until it feels it has completely degraded Hamas capability and it has not done that yet.\nThis will be a huge disappointment for the people of Gaza, who are desperate for this war to stop.\nEarly on Friday, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry put the overall death toll there since 7 October at 20,057, including at least 8,000 children and 6,200 women.\nWhen Hamas and their allies broke through the heavily guarded perimeter with Israel on 7 October they killed 1,200 people."}

On Wednesday a convoy carrying aid from Jordan crossed into Gaza via Israel for the first time since the start of the war.\nHowaida Al-Daramali, a Palestinian woman who has been displaced to Khan Younis and who is also helping find shelter for other displaced families, said the limited aid being delivered \"only goes to one or two places\" and most people in Gaza were not receiving anything.\n\"We want this aid to be accompanied by teams who will be responsible for distributing it especially since the situation here is very difficult. Many people broke into the Red Crescent warehouses and looted them,\" she told the BBC.\nMeanwhile some families who were getting aid because they were in UN-run shelters were selling what they did not need at inflated prices, Ms al-Daramali said.\n\"Even with cash, there are no goods in the supermarket and no suppliers. We can buy only from people who receive aid and sell it at the school gates, which are dangerous places for us to reach,\" she said.\nPeople in Khan Younis were \"psychologically and economically devastated\", she said.\nThe UN Security Council is meanwhile trying to agree on a vote calling for more aid to get into Gaza. The vote has been delayed for several days over the wording of the text. \nThe US has expressed support for the latest draft resolution after earlier voicing \"widespread concerns\" with an earlier version that called for a ceasefire - something the US is against, saying it would only benefit Hamas. \nThe new draft aims to create a mechanism to accelerate aid but makes clear it would involve relevant parties such as Israel. \nIt also calls for all available routes to be used for deliveries but does not seek an immediate end to the fighting. \nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, US Ambassador to the UN, described it as a \"very strong resolution that is fully supported by the Arab group\".\nMeanwhile, the fighting in and around Gaza continues. Hamas authorities on Thursday accused Israel of attacking the Rafah crossing - killing four people, including the director of the recently reopened Kerem Shalom crossing. Israel's military has not commented on the reported incident. \nTalks had been taking place in Egypt to reach a new truce - similar to the week-long pause in fighting last month that saw hostages released.\nBut on Thursday they suffered a setback when Hamas said it would not agree to a release of some hostages in exchange for a partial ceasefire.\nIt said Palestinian groups had rejected the prospect of more hostages being released until Israel agrees to end the war. Israel has repeatedly rejected a permanent ceasefire with Hamas, saying it aims to destroy the group.\nMore than 240 Israeli hostages were captured on 7 October when Hamas broke through the fortified perimeter with Israel, killing 1,200 people. A total of 110 hostages were released in the truce last month.\nEarlier this week, Hamas said the number of people killed in Gaza in 10 weeks of fighting had passed 20,000."}

After a backlash, the paper removed the article from its website, saying on X (formerly Twitter) that the report \"was based on faulty sourcing\". \nA few weeks earlier, a video of Israeli siblings Rotem Mathias, 16, and his two sisters, Shakked and Shir, went viral online. Rotem witnessed his parents get killed by Hamas gunmen on 7 October as they sheltered in their house in a kibbutz near the border with Gaza.\nThe viral video featured edited clips from the siblings' interviews with US outlets ABC and CNN days after the attack. It falsely claimed that they were \"crisis actors\" who were lying about their parents' deaths and struggling to hold their laughter in front of cameras.\nThese are just two examples - viewed millions of times each - showcasing the social media schism in the Israel-Gaza war that has brought denial of atrocities and human suffering to the forefront of online debate about the conflict.\nOne of the key terms used to deny or minimise human suffering in Gaza is \"Pallywood\", a disparaging combination of \"Palestine\" and \"Hollywood\". Its proponents claim fake or staged footage of Palestinian \"crisis actors\" posing as genuine civilian casualties is regularly shared online to influence public opinion and deceive global media.\nA BBC Verify analysis suggests that on X alone, the term \"Pallywood\" has seen the largest spike in the number of mentions in the past 10 years. \nDuring previous flare-ups of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in 2014, 2018 and 2021 the word \"Pallywood\" consistently peaked at either 9,500 or 13,000 mentions in a single month on X. After the 7 October Hamas attack, the number of mentions peaked at 220,000 in November.\nBBC Verify found that among those sharing the term \"Pallywood\" on social media in the past months, including X, Facebook and Instagram, were Israeli officials, celebrities and popular bloggers from Israel and the US.\nOn the other hand, while supporters of the Palestinians do not have a single term used to deny atrocities committed by Hamas on 7 October in Israel, posts making such claims routinely get millions of views on social media. Some falsely say that Hamas did not kill civilians on that day, or that the scale of civilian casualties has been massively exaggerated. Some even go further, falsely claiming that most of the victims were actually killed by the Israel Defense Forces, not Hamas.\nExperts specialising in reconciliation efforts worry that viral disinformation which denies the other side's suffering can be dehumanising, and may impact the longer-term prospects of mending the relations between the communities affected.\n\"The biggest risks, I think, are the erosion of trust and the erosion of empathy,\" said Harriet Vickers, programme lead at the Tim Parry and Johnathan Ball Foundation for Peace, a charity that supports victims of conflict, political violence and acts of terror. \n\"It undermines the ability to even begin approaching reconciliation efforts.\"\nShe added that false narratives and dehumanising rhetoric can also \"have a profound effect beyond those that are directly impacted by violence, and can actually further the hurt that is being done to those individuals\".\nFalse narratives about \"crisis actors\" or atrocity denial are not new to those who study disinformation. \nThe concept of \"crisis actors\" in particular - that is people who pretend or are paid to act out some particular tragedy or disaster - has been popular among promoters of conspiracy theories for years.\nIt was notoriously used to allege that parents of dead children in the Sandy Hook school shooting in the US were somehow faking their personal tragedies. \nIn the past few years similar viral claims were posted about the killing of Ukrainian civilians in Bucha, and victims of the war in Syria. \nBut the volume of dehumanising rhetoric posted during this war has surprised even those who deal with such content on a daily basis.\nEliot Higgins, the founder of the investigative website Bellingcat that has covered the wars in Syria and Ukraine in recent years, says the volume of disinformation in the current Israeli-Gaza war is \"unique to this conflict\".\n\"I've seen the kind of same intensity of toxicity and vile responses and disinformation, the way they treat women and children and that kind of stuff, with Syria, with Ukraine and so many different topics - just there are more people doing it,\" he told the BBC.\nMr Higgins added that because many people have had very strong opinions about either side of the conflict for years, \"there are more people who are sharing stuff because it is resonating with them emotionally\".\n\"They don't really care if it's true or not, it just feels true to them.\" \nBack in November, a video showing makeup and fake blood being applied to a child actor's face was posted on X by Ofir Gendelman, the Israeli prime minister's spokesperson to the Arab world.\n\"See for yourselves how they fake injuries and evacuating 'injured' civilians, all in front of the cameras. Pallywood gets busted again,\" Mr Gendelman said in a post that was viewed millions of times before being deleted.\nThe video was, in fact, behind-the-scenes footage from a 45-second Lebanese film made in tribute to Gazans and posted online in October. \nDirector Mahmoud Ramzi, who took to Instagram to personally debunk the false claim made about his film, told the BBC that in the end, the misinformation might have backfired, with the controversy helping his film reach a much bigger audience.\nThe BBC approached Mr Gendelman for comment but he has not responded.\nOthers have expressed concern for the real people who find themselves in the middle of online disinformation wars. James Longman, the ABC correspondent who interviewed Rotem and his sisters, says watching Rotem recount the death of his parents brought him and his cameraman to tears.\n\"He was in tears, his sister was in tears, their grandfather, who was with us. Our cameraman, the hospital porters, the nurses, the doctors, and I was in tears. I mean all of us sitting there listening to what he had to say,\" he told the BBC. \n\"It was extraordinary to hear him say it, to watch his reactions as he explained what had happened.\"\nMr Longman said he was shocked when he saw false claims about the siblings being shared online and took to X to debunk it. His post was shared widely, and led to at least one of the viral messages about the siblings being subsequently deleted by the person who posted it.\n\"But it doesn't make it any less horrible for Rotem's family,\" Mr Longman said.

The BBC Arabic cameraman shares a vivid and shocking account of what he, his wife and children experienced as they headed south.\nWarning: This story contains graphic descriptions which may be distressing\nWe left in such a hurry. We were in the middle of baking some bread and realised the houses opposite us were being bombed, one by one. I knew it would soon be our turn. We had packed some bags in case this happened but everything was so rushed we forgot to take them. We didn't even shut the front door.\nWe had waited to leave because we didn't want to move my elderly parents and we had taken years to save up to build our house in al-Zeitoun, but in the end we had to go. My baby son, Omar, died there in November 2012, killed when shrapnel hit our house in another war with Israel and I couldn't risk losing any more children.\nI knew that in the south there was no electricity, no water and people had to queue for hours to use a toilet. But in the end, grabbing just a bottle of water and some leftover bread, we joined thousands of others making the dangerous journey down the Salah al-Din road to the south, where Israel said it was safe.\nLots of my family walked together - my wife Ahlam, our four sons, who are two, eight, nine and 14 years old, my parents, brothers, sisters, cousins and their children.   \nWe walked for hours and knew that eventually we would have to go through an Israeli checkpoint that was set up during the war. We were nervous and my children kept asking: \"What will the army do to us?\"\nWe came to a stop about two-thirds of a mile (1km) from the checkpoint and joined a huge queue of people that filled the entire road. We spent more than four hours waiting there and my father fainted three times. \nThere were Israeli soldiers watching us from bombed-out buildings on one side of the road and more on an empty plot of land on the other side.\nAs we edged closer to the checkpoint we saw more soldiers above us in a tent on a hill. We think they managed the checkpoint remotely from there, watching us through binoculars and using loudspeakers to tell us what to do.\nThere were two open-sided shipping containers near the tent. All the men had to pass through one and the women through the other, with cameras constantly trained on us. When we had gone through, Israeli soldiers asked to see our IDs and we were photographed.\nIt was like judgement day.\nI saw about 50 people detained, all men, including two of my neighbours. One young man was stopped because he had lost his documents and couldn't remember his ID number. Another man next to me in the queue was called a terrorist by an Israeli soldier, before he too was taken away. \nThey were told to strip down to their underwear and sit on the ground. Some were later asked to get dressed and leave, while others were blindfolded.\nI saw four blindfolded detainees, including my neighbours, taken behind a sand hill by a demolished building. When they were out of sight, we heard gunfire. I have no idea whether they were shot or not.\nSeparately, other people who made the same journey as me were contacted by a colleague of mine in Cairo. One of them, Kamal Aljojo, said that just after he went through the checkpoint a week earlier, he had seen dead bodies, but he didn't know how they had died.\nMy colleague also spoke to a man called Muhammed who went through the same checkpoint on 13 November. \"A soldier asked me to strip off all of my clothes, even my underwear,\" Muhammed told the BBC. He added: \"I was naked in front of everyone walking past. I felt ashamed. Suddenly a female soldier pointed her gun at me and laughed before quickly moving it away. I was humiliated.\" Muhammed said he had to wait naked for about two hours before he was allowed to go.\nAlthough my wife, children, parents and I all got through the checkpoint safely, two of my brothers were delayed.\nWhile we were waiting for them, an Israeli soldier shouted at a group of people in front of us who were trying to go back towards the containers to check on their relatives, who had been held up. \nHe used a loudspeaker to tell them to move on and to stay at least 300yds (300m) away, then a soldier started shooting in the air in their direction to intimidate them. We had heard a lot of gunshots while we were queueing. \nEveryone was crying and my mother was sobbing: \"What happened to my sons? Did they shoot them?\" \nAfter well over an hour my brothers finally appeared.    \nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that \"individuals suspected of affiliations with terrorist organisations\" were detained for preliminary inquiries, and if they remained suspects they were transferred to Israel for further questioning. Others were \"promptly released\", it said.\nIt said clothes had to be removed to check for explosive vests or other weapons and detainees were clothed as soon possible. It said it did not aim to \"undermine the security and dignity of the detainees\" and that the IDF \"operates in accordance with international law\".\nThe IDF also said it \"does not shoot at civilians moving along the humanitarian corridor from the north to the south\", but when young men tried to move in the opposite direction they \"were met with shots for the purposes of dispersal, after they were told with a loudspeaker not to advance towards the position of the troops and continued to do so\".\nIt added that the sound of shooting was common and \"the sound of gunfire alone does not constitute an indication of shooting from a specific place or of a certain type\".\nMy wife and I felt relieved as we moved on and the checkpoint disappeared from sight behind us, but we had no idea that the hardest part of the journey was yet to come.\nAs we walked further south, I saw about 10 bodies in different places by the roadside.\nOther scattered, rotting body parts, were covered in flies with birds pecking at the remains. They gave off one of the foulest smells I have ever experienced.\nI couldn't bear the thought of my children seeing them so I screamed at the top of my lungs, telling them to look at the sky and keep walking.\nI saw a burned-out car with a severed human head inside. The hands of the headless rotting corpse were still holding the steering wheel. \nThere were also bodies of dead donkeys and horses, some reduced to skeletons, and huge piles of rubbish and spoiled food. \nThen an Israeli tank appeared on a side road, moving towards us at breakneck speed. We were frightened and in order to get away, we had to run over corpses. Some people in the crowd tripped on the bodies. The tank changed course about 20yds (20m) before it reached the main road.\nSuddenly, next to the road, a building was bombed. The explosion was terrifying and shrapnel flew everywhere. \nI wanted the world to swallow us up.  \nWe were shaken and exhausted but carried on towards Nuseirat camp. We arrived there in the evening and had to sleep on the pavement. It was freezing.\nWe put my jacket around our middle sons, tucking their hands into the sleeves to try to keep them warm. We covered our youngest with my shirt. I have never been so cold in all my life.\nWhen the BBC asked about the tank and the bodies, the IDF said that \"during the day, tanks move on routes that intersect with the Salah al-Din road, but there was no case in which tanks moved towards civilians moving from north to south of the Gaza Strip on the humanitarian corridor\".\nThe IDF said it did not know of any cases of piles of corpses on the Salah al-Din road but there were times when Gazan vehicles \"abandoned bodies during the journey, which the IDF subsequently evacuated\". \nThe next morning we set off early for Khan Younis, Gaza's second largest city. We paid someone to take us part of the way in a cart pulled by a donkey. Then at Deir al-Balah, we got on a bus that was only meant to carry 20 people, but 30 people got on board. Some sat on the roof and others clung to the doors and windows from the outside.\nIn Khan Younis, we tried to find a safe place to stay at a UN-run school that had been turned into a shelter, but it was full. We ended up renting a warehouse under a residential building instead and stayed there for a week.\nMy parents, brother and sisters decided to stay in Khan Younis, but after the local market was bombed, my wife and I decided to take our children further south to Rafah to be with her family. They managed to get a lift in a car and I joined them later by bus, but it was so full I had to hang on to the outside of the door. \nWe are now renting a small outhouse with a roof made of tin and plastic. There is nothing to protect us from falling shrapnel.  \nEverything is expensive and we can't get many of the things we need. If we want drinking water, we have to queue for three hours and we don't have enough food for three meals a day, so we don't eat lunch any more, only breakfast and dinner.\nMy son used to have an egg every day. An egg - can you imagine? I can't even give him that now. All I want to do is leave Gaza and be safe with my children, even if that means living in a tent.  \nAdditional reporting by BBC News Arabic's Abdelrahman Abutaleb in Cairo."}

But eventually, it is likely the Supreme Court will have to make a ruling anyway.  \nMr Smith had argued that the appeals process could delay the start of the trial, which is due to begin on 4 March. \nFor now, the judge in the case, Tanya Chutkan, has paused proceedings while Mr Trump's legal team appeals. He has repeatedly argued he has immunity from prosecution because he was acting in an official capacity at the time of the riot. \nGene Rossi, a former federal prosecutor with decades of experience at the US justice department, told the BBC the decision is a \"huge setback for Jack Smith on the scheduling front\". \n\"However, his request for expedited review was a noble attempt to move this trial along,\" he added. \"Mr Trump, whose immunity appeal is not strong, will not face the 6 January music for multiple months.\" \nMr Rossi added that Judge Chutkan \"does not care one iota that he is a presidential candidate\" and, despite the appeals process, will still want her trial to move \"with utmost alacrity\".\nThe trial, he added, may ultimately end up being pushed back to late July or early August - which would fall shortly after the Republican National Convention, beginning on 15 July. \n\"Simply put, that would be a scheduling hot mess,\" he said. \"The worst thing [for Mr Trump] would be to have a jury considering whether he's basically an insurrectionist at that time. That's not good for your campaign... he's delaying the inevitable.\" \nAnother former federal prosecutor, Case Western Reserve University Professor Kevin McMunigal, said that the Supreme Court's decision \"is not surprising\", given that a \"typical pattern\" in a legal case would be for an appeals court to decide on a matter before it is brought to the high court.\n\"But I'm not sure that this will necessarily delay the trial,\" he added.\nGregory Wallance, a former federal prosecutor who helped convict seven lawmakers for bribery as part of an FBI sting in the late 1970s, told the BBC: \"It's a win for Trump.\n\"But how big a win depends on whether his appeal of the immunity ruling delays his January 6 trial until past the election, which right now is unpredictable.\"\nA fast-tracked process would not have been without precedent.  \nCarl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia, told the BBC that the Supreme Court had expedited 19 cases in the last four years. \nIn 1974 the justices fast-tracked the case of US v Nixon, which led to the release of the Watergate tapes, dealing a fatal blow to the presidency of Richard Nixon. \n\"Trump's delay strategy appears to be working,\" Mr Tobias said. \n\"All of [this] will consume time, and, thus, complicate efforts to start the trial before Judge Chutkan on the early March date.\" \nArguments are set to be heard in the case in DC Circuit Court on 9 January. \nIt is one of two election-subversion indictments against Mr Trump. He also faces two other criminal cases, one over classified papers and another to do with hush money.\nWith additional reporting by Max Matza"}

But how are its nine justices likely to view it?\nAlmost all experts who spoke to the BBC said the Supreme Court would likely take up the case and overrule Colorado's decision to disqualify Mr Trump, but would look to do so in the least damaging way.\nTheir decision not to fast-track a case on whether he has immunity from prosecution for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election is evidence of their reluctance to be drawn into the political arena.\n\"I suspect that institutional caution on their part will impel them towards not upholding the disqualification of Donald Trump,\" Prof Issacharoff said.\nRobert Tsai, a law professor at Boston University, expressed a similar view. He said the court would be thinking: \"What's going to be the opinion that looks the least damaging that overrules the Colorado Supreme Court?\"\nThe court has a number of legal options available to it if it does take issue with the Colorado decision, the experts said. Some of those are more forceful and final than others.\nThe most decisive potential ruling, the experts said, would be to issue a direct opinion on whether Mr Trump should be disqualified from running for federal office.\nIf they rule directly on that, and overrule Colorado, their decision would apply in all states and the former president would be back on the ballot.\nOne decisive option would require a majority of the justices to say that they are legally convinced that Mr Trump did not engage in insurrection.\nThe other decisive option would be for a majority of the justices to find that he did.\n\"My general reaction is that the Colorado Supreme Court got it right. What happened on January 6 was an insurrection. Trump did engage in it, therefore he is disqualified,\" Prof Somin said.\nThere was some doubt among legal experts, though, about what exactly constitutes insurrection within the amendment used to disqualify Mr Trump. There is little legal precedent to point to in the 150 years since the Civil War-era amendment went into effect.\nIt was originally written to prevent former Confederate soldiers and politicians who lost the Civil War from being elected into office and overthrowing the Union.\nExperts told the BBC it could not have been imagined that the amendment would be applied to a former president running for re-election who is also the dominant candidate of his party.\n\"You don't have a clear definition of what insurrection is within the meaning of the 14th Amendment. It's not clear. It just uses the word,\" Prof Tsai said.\nThe other issue with disqualifying Mr Trump on the grounds of engaging in an insurrection is that he has not yet been found guilty of doing so by any court.\nThis opens the door to the Supreme Court finding Colorado's decision to be procedurally flawed under the scope of an old legal doctrine called the political question doctrine. It states that in the absence of a court ruling that someone did engage in an insurrection, the question of eligibility is a political question for Congress, not for the courts, Prof Tsai said.\nThe Supreme Court could also decide that the \"officer of the United States\" referred to in the 14th Amendment does not refer to the presidency. Some experts have noted that this was one of the weaker arguments.\n\"If there's anybody who's an officer of the United States, it's somebody who holds the highest and most powerful office in federal government,\" Prof Somin said. \nBut others have said the lack of explicit mention of \"president\" in the text is likely to appeal to many of the conservative judges on the Supreme Court, as it did to a lower court in Colorado.\n\"That's certainly the kind of answer that would appeal to someone like [Chief Justice] John Roberts,\" Prof Tsai said. \"When he feels like an issue is too politically fraught, he can come up with an opinion that kind of dumps it in someone else's lap or gives neither side a clean victory.\"\nThis option would also be favourable to Neil Gorsuch, too, he said.\n\"That would appeal to him [as] a textualist\", Prof Tsai said, someone who expressly looks to give meaning to the words strictly in the text.\nA softer option would be for the court to overrule it on technical grounds. \nBut legal analysts say a softer, more procedural, ruling, such as one that suggests there was insufficient evidence in Colorado, could mean the issue is left unresolved in the longer term.\n\"The Supreme Court could end up dismissing on procedural grounds [which] would allow the issue to continue to percolate among state governments and lower courts,\" Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, said.\n\"There would be a price to doing that because there would be further uncertainty as to how this issue would be resolved,\" he said. \n\"If they did it in a way in which state courts and state officials could continue to make their own decisions on the issue, then the price would be that Mr Trump could be disqualified in some states and not in others,\" Prof Somin said.\nHowever, the future ruling of the Supreme Court in Mr Trump's Colorado case lies mostly in uncertainty, the experts said.\n\"They've never been presented with anything like this,\" Prof Tsai said. \"They're kind of in a tough spot. If they step in and save the president here, then it's going to look partisan.\"\n\"If they don't step in, it's going to be a huge mess potentially.\"\nProf Issacharoff put it more simply: \"It's a lose-lose.\""}

Jang had called the police in South Korea's capital Seoul after not being able to reach Jun-an on his mobile phone for days.\nWhen they forced open his brother's door, Jang found Jun-an lying lifeless on the bed. \"I never thought my brother would take his own life,\" he says.\nThis was despite Jun-an having tried to kill himself five years earlier, in 2013 - Jang thought he'd been happier since then after receiving treatment in a psychiatric clinic.\n\"It couldn't have been perfect,\" says Jang, \"but we thought he was finding his way back into the world. He didn't show any signs of suffering. I think he didn't want to be a burden to the family.\"\nIt is still really hard for Jang to talk openly about what his family has gone through because suicide is such a sensitive issue in South Korea. Earlier this year it announced new plans to try to bring down its suicide rates - some of the highest in the world.\nSouth Korea is famous for K-pop and global companies like Samsung. But in this outwardly successful society, on average more than 35 people take their own lives every day and suicide is the leading cause of death among those aged 10 to 39.\nJang, 46, is doing his best to raise awareness by sharing his personal journey. At the time he found Jun-an's body he'd actually been taking a course to become a suicide prevention instructor.\n\"I visited schools to educate children about the common signs of a person thinking about suicide and what can be done to help them. I tried to save other people's lives.\"\nJang had long thought of getting this training because his family had a high risk of suicide. He hoped they'd made it through their struggles and wanted to give something back to society.\nJang and Jun-an's family went through a particularly difficult time in 2010, when South Korea severed all economic ties with the North. This was after the sinking of the warship Cheonan, which killed 46 sailors.\nHis father ran one of the few companies that did business with the North - and the sudden termination of relations led to the business going bankrupt.\nThe family had to separate and live in different places. The business his father ran failed and Jun-an became \"our only hope\", says Jang, recalling the pressure put on his brother.\nJun-an had done well at school and planned to study abroad, but the family could no longer support him.\nAt the time of Jun-an's suicide attempt in 2013, Jang was still busy paying off his family's debts and was trying to become a qualified counsellor while doing his day job.\nIt was only after Jun-an's death five years later that Jang asked to see his brother's medical records - and found out he had been going to therapy every week for nearly a decade.\n\"Like many other Korean families, he was under great pressure to succeed. But finances were limited and life was hard for him,\" says Jang.\n\"My brother was fiercely fighting depression. It breaks my heart that I didn't notice this for so long.\"\nAt 25.2 deaths per 100,000 people, South Korea's suicide rate is the highest among the wealthy 38-member Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). It is more than double the OECD average of 10.6 deaths.\nSouth Korea launched its first national suicide initiative in 2004, a year after topping the OECD ranking - it has had the highest rate ever since, except in 2016 and 2017.\nThe country's statistics agency says 12,906 people took their lives in 2022.\nMore than two in five of all deaths among teenagers (42.3%) are due to suicide. This rises to 50.6% for people in their 20s, and then dips to 47.9% for people in their 30s.\nJang's brother was part of this generation struggling to get by.\nThe South Korean government announced a five-year plan to prevent suicides in April, with the goal of reducing the country's rate by 30%, which would move it off top spot in the OECD table.\nPlans include a state-funded medical check-up for mental health every two years, greater support for local communities to look after vulnerable people, better moderation of explicit and harmful content online and a rapid system for reporting this content directly to the police.\nWill the new plan work?\nThe health minister, who set the new target, has said it will not be an easy task.\nWhile there is no magic formula to solve the suicide problem in South Korea, many point to the lack of budget. Its neighbour Japan also had one of the highest suicide rates in the world, peaking in 2003. But the rate has been gradually declining since then.\nA recent joint study by Korean and Japanese researchers found that one of the main differences in suicide prevention policies between the two countries is money.\nIn 2018, South Korea's budget for suicide prevention was about $16.8m (£13m) - just 2.1% of Japan's budget of $793.7m.\nBut it is not just about money. South Korea's suicide rate is a mix of economic, social and cultural factors.\nThe country rose to become a global economic power after being torn apart by the Korean War, which ended in 1953. But this rapid economic growth did not lead to an expansion of state services, and instead contributed to rising inequality.\nThis birthed a society built on high levels of competition and success, which eventually led to many citizens suffering from psychological problems.\nExperts have long highlighted the danger of a society that focuses too much on a person's success, usually in terms of money or social status.\n\"Beyond the high suicide rate in South Korea, there is a sad story of a society with a weak welfare system, but one that is very success-oriented, usually reflected in how much wealth one acquires,\" says Soong-nang Jang, dean at Chung-Ang University's College of Nursing.\n\"And as traditional ties between family members and neighbours weaken, everyone seems to be fighting this battle for success on their own.\"\nThe culture is slowly changing, but much remains to be done.\n\"South Koreans are so used to getting ahead in this hyper-competitive society, and Korea is not exactly a place where it's easy to express your feelings,\" says Yeon-soo Kim, director of LifeLine Seoseoul, a charity that provides a 24-hour helpline to suicide prevention services.\n\"People need more space to express their struggles and feelings freely and safely. We need to keep reminding people that there are different ways to succeed and really acknowledge that.\"\nJang now works as a clinical psychologist at a mental health centre in Seoul, helping families who have been affected by suicide or people who have suicidal thoughts.\nHe also leads support groups for families like his who have lost loved ones to suicide.\n\"It's a tough job. The family members are often the first to discover the body. They remember the scene very vividly and also describe what happened very graphically.\"\nJang is aware of the emotional toll these conversations take on him.\n\"But this job is worth it when you see them getting better.\"\nAnd there has been a sense of acceptance and understanding in his own family too. As a qualified counsellor, he knew it was important to talk and he made the effort.\nAfter his brother died, he visited his parents every weekend for a year. He shared what he had heard in the local support groups and comforted them.\nJang says his brother left a note behind saying sorry to his parents and him for leaving them.\nBut when the family visited his grave, Jang told his little brother: \"It's okay.\"\n\"You don't have to be sorry. We're doing good, caring for each other,\" says Jang. \"So no need to be sorry, we'll be back.\"\nIf you, or someone you know, have been affected by issues in this article, the following resources may help:"}

But how are its nine justices likely to view it?\nAlmost all experts who spoke to the BBC said the Supreme Court would likely take up the case and overrule Colorado's decision to disqualify Mr Trump, but would look to do so in the least damaging way.\nTheir decision not to fast-track a case on whether he has immunity from prosecution for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election is evidence of their reluctance to be drawn into the political arena.\n\"I suspect that institutional caution on their part will impel them towards not upholding the disqualification of Donald Trump,\" Prof Issacharoff said.\nRobert Tsai, a law professor at Boston University, expressed a similar view. He said the court would be thinking: \"What's going to be the opinion that looks the least damaging that overrules the Colorado Supreme Court?\"\nThe court has a number of legal options available to it if it does take issue with the Colorado decision, the experts said. Some of those are more forceful and final than others.\nThe most decisive potential ruling, the experts said, would be to issue a direct opinion on whether Mr Trump should be disqualified from running for federal office.\nIf they rule directly on that, and overrule Colorado, their decision would apply in all states and the former president would be back on the ballot.\nOne decisive option would require a majority of the justices to say that they are legally convinced that Mr Trump did not engage in insurrection.\nThe other decisive option would be for a majority of the justices to find that he did.\n\"My general reaction is that the Colorado Supreme Court got it right.

The police cordon has now gone but the Charles University building is still a major crime scene.\nThe body of the 14th victim of the worst mass shooting in Czech history was only removed this morning.\nAcross town, at the gates of another university building, a shrine has been growing in memory of the 14 staff and students who were killed. People have been leaving small candles on the cobblestones in red glass holders and laying flowers.\nThe crowd huddled round in the sleet is mainly young, including many university and school students.\nLucy had brought a big bunch of white roses. \"It's the least we can do,\" she said. She was at the law faculty when the shooting began, just a couple of hundred metres away.\n\"They locked up and told us not to leave. There were lots of emergency cars and police. We didn't really know what was going on,\" she said.\n\"Now all we are talking about is that it could have been anybody. It could have been my friends. Anyone could have been a victim and that's horrifying.\"\nSimon's friend is a medic who was on duty on Thursday. \"He said it was quite brutal. It was a big-calibre gun so the injuries were pretty bad,\" he told me. \"And it could have been our faculty. So it's pretty stressful.\"\nOne video filmed at the scene shows the gunman, a 24-year old history student, on the roof of the Arts Faculty firing shots into the street. Behind the camera, someone is yelling to shoot at him - not the students.\nOther images have shown students clinging to the outside of the university wall, perched on a ledge high above ground as the gunman dressed all in black prowls above them, just metres away.\nInformation about the man and his motives is limited. We know from police that he had killed his own father that morning. Police are also now linking him to a murder in a forest outside Prague a few days ago, when a man and a two-month-old baby were shot and killed.\nBut at the shrine, no-one wanted to talk about the shooter.\n\"He doesn't deserve it,\" Natalie told me. She was there to offer help to those struggling to cope and was clearly shaken herself. \"It's very upsetting. I still can't really process that it really happened. It's very sad. I am scared.\"\nPolice have asked for the shooter not to be named, assuming he was seeking notoriety with his deadly attack.\nThe interior ministry has been defending the actions of the police, after it emerged that they had information that an armed man was heading into the city centre and planning to kill himself, having murdered his father.\nHe was scheduled to attend a lecture so officers rushed to evacuate the building. As they did, the gunman opened fire at a different faculty up the road.\nPolice later said the gunman had a \"huge arsenal\" of guns and ammunition. It's not clear how he accumulated so much firepower, although as far as we understand he did have a licence.\nStudents at the shrine didn't blame police that so many were killed and injured. They thought they'd done everything possible, in horrific circumstances.\nBut like many, Natalie said she had begun thinking that universities needed better protection.\n\"We used to feel safe. Now we see all the holes in security and what needs improving. We don't like to be more restricted, but I guess it's a new age. Unfortunately we will have to improve.\"\nAs we spoke, a guide in a headset approached with a group of foreign tourists and began explaining what had happened.\nChristmas is one of the busiest times of year in Prague, and the beautiful streets and markets are still bustling with visitors.\n\"Don't worry, it's all over. The killer is dead. This is a safe city,\" the guide called Jan told his audience.\nBut today, for the first time, that's not how it feels for many here."}

And although the shooter's name was on a list of suspects, that list was long.\nFor days, police had searched the Klanovicky forest, after a witness heard shots ringing out.\n\"We were days from uncovering the shooter from the forest,\" said Prague police director Petr Matejcek after the university shootings.\nBallistics tests are being carried out, and if they confirm the 24-year-old student was the killer, he will have left behind a trail of 17 victims in seven days.\nPolice are facing criticism for their handling of the university attack, but they say they had been working 24 hours a day on the forest murders and could not have foreseen what was coming.\n\"We don't have particular proof or information from him why he decided to do something so terrible,\" Interior Minister Vit Rakusan told the BBC.\nHe had no criminal record, no history of violence. Earlier this year he had won a prize for a bachelor's thesis from Prague's Polish Institute.\nIt was more than two and a half hours before the university shootings began on Thursday that police were first alerted to a crime in Hostoun, a village 20km (12 miles) west of the capital.\nAt 12:26 local time, a woman called police to say her friend had sent her a text saying he was going to take his life and was not responding to calls, Police Col Vojtech Motyka told reporters.\nSixteen minutes later, they determined that he was heading to Prague, and at about 13:00 a man's body - the shooter's father - was recovered in Hostoun.\nCol Motyka said a device in the house was found that might be a bomb.\nAt 13:15 a nationwide search was launched for the missing student, and at 13:27 Prague police were asked to search for an armed suspect, presumed to be at the faculty of arts in Prague.\nBut the faculty has several facilities and no police units were sent to the iconic building on Jan Palach Square, close to the Vltava river. Instead, they were all sent to Celetna Street, a few minutes' walk into the Old Town, and began evacuating the building at 14:22.\nShould they have all gone to one faculty, rather than spreading out? The interior minister said at this point they had no indication of anyone else at risk other than the shooter himself, who they were told was due to attend a lecture.\nJust before 15:00, shooting was reported from the larger faculty building on Jan Palach Square.\nIt was at that moment that David Vichnar, an assistant literature professor, described going up two floors in the lift before becoming stuck there for 15 minutes with the lights out while banging noises went on around him.\nMeanwhile, police say it took them four minutes from the first alert at 14:59 to enter the building. The first officers on the scene were carrying handguns.\nDavid Vichnar describes being told by three armed officers to lie face down on the ground. \"There was another person huddled in the corner who told me, 'There's a shooter on the roof,'\" he told Radio Prague International.\nBodycam footage shows armed officers in protective gear climbing the stairs of the faculty, entering classrooms and going on to balconies. Many of the students had managed to barricade themselves in.\nIn one room, police are seen treating some of the shooter's victims and one is seen being carried out of the building on a stretcher.\nAmong those killed was eminent musicologist Lenka Hlavkova, who specialised in medieval music. Only an hour before, she had sent an email to a colleague about plans for the Prague Spring music festival next May.\nThe shooter had a licence for eight guns, although it is not yet clear how many he had with him inside the building.\nIt was unknown how he was able to get hold of such a large arsenal and the interior minister says he could have killed many more students.\nPrague police director Petr Matejcek described being inside the faculty as the attack unfolded and being shocked at the \"incredible\" piles of ammunition in the corridors. How he managed to bring his guns and ammunition into the building is part of the investigation.\nBy 15:11 the attacker was on the roof and opening fire and it took police time to reach him.\nOver the next nine minutes, students are seen scrambling to safety, some of them leaping from an upper ledge to a lower floor.\nThree people on the ground were wounded, as the gunman targeted a police car and another vehicle.\nOne man filming from the ground shouted out, attempting to distract the man from the students trying to escape. \"I am here, shoot here, come over here!\"\nAt 15:20, the shooter was dead: he saw armed officers coming and turned the gun on himself, say police.\nIt took some time for them to secure the building, but eventually students were escorted to safety with their hands raised as a precaution.\nFourteen students and staff lost their lives in the attack on Charles University: 13 were murdered in the building, while another died later in hospital. Twenty-five others were injured.\nCzech reports said one of the victims had died falling from the building and others had also been hurt trying to escape."}

This rises to 50.6% for people in their 20s, and then dips to 47.9% for people in their 30s.\nJang's brother was part of this generation struggling to get by.\nThe South Korean government announced a five-year plan to prevent suicides in April, with the goal of reducing the country's rate by 30%, which would move it off top spot in the OECD table.\nPlans include a state-funded medical check-up for mental health every two years, greater support for local communities to look after vulnerable people, better moderation of explicit and harmful content online and a rapid system for reporting this content directly to the police.\nWill the new plan work?\nThe health minister, who set the new target, has said it will not be an easy task.\nWhile there is no magic formula to solve the suicide problem in South Korea, many point to the lack of budget. Its neighbour Japan also had one of the highest suicide rates in the world, peaking in 2003. But the rate has been gradually declining since then.\nA recent joint study by Korean and Japanese researchers found that one of the main differences in suicide prevention policies between the two countries is money.\nIn 2018, South Korea's budget for suicide prevention was about $16.8m (£13m) - just 2.1% of Japan's budget of $793.7m.\nBut it is not just about money. South Korea's suicide rate is a mix of economic, social and cultural factors.\nThe country rose to become a global economic power after being torn apart by the Korean War, which ended in 1953. But this rapid economic growth did not lead to an expansion of state services, and instead contributed to rising inequality.\nThis birthed a society built on high levels of competition and success, which eventually led to many citizens suffering from psychological problems.\nExperts have long highlighted the danger of a society that focuses too much on a person's success, usually in terms of money or social status.\n\"Beyond the high suicide rate in South Korea, there is a sad story of a society with a weak welfare system, but one that is very success-oriented, usually reflected in how much wealth one acquires,\" says Soong-nang Jang, dean at Chung-Ang University's College of Nursing.\n\"And as traditional ties between family members and neighbours weaken, everyone seems to be fighting this battle for success on their own.\"\nThe culture is slowly changing, but much remains to be done.\n\"South Koreans are so used to getting ahead in this hyper-competitive society, and Korea is not exactly a place where it's easy to express your feelings,\" says Yeon-soo Kim, director of LifeLine Seoseoul, a charity that provides a 24-hour helpline to suicide prevention services.\n\"People need more space to express their struggles and feelings freely and safely. We need to keep reminding people that there are different ways to succeed and really acknowledge that.\"\nJang now works as a clinical psychologist at a mental health centre in Seoul, helping families who have been affected by suicide or people who have suicidal thoughts.\nHe also leads support groups for families like his who have lost loved ones to suicide.\n\"It's a tough job. The family members are often the first to discover the body. They remember the scene very vividly and also describe what happened very graphically.\"\nJang is aware of the emotional toll these conversations take on him.\n\"But this job is worth it when you see them getting better.\"\nAnd there has been a sense of acceptance and understanding in his own family too. As a qualified counsellor, he knew it was important to talk and he made the effort.\nAfter his brother died, he visited his parents every weekend for a year. He shared what he had heard in the local support groups and comforted them.\nJang says his brother left a note behind saying sorry to his parents and him for leaving them.\nBut when the family visited his grave, Jang told his little brother: \"It's okay.\"\n\"You don't have to be sorry. We're doing good, caring for each other,\" says Jang. \"So no need to be sorry, we'll be back.\"\nIf you, or someone you know, have been affected by issues in this article, the following resources may help:"}

It took off online and was echoed by members of the US Congress making crucial decisions about military spending.\nIt was an incredible assertion - using two advisers as proxies, Mr Zelensky paid $75m (£59m) for two yachts.\nBut not only has the Ukrainian government flatly denied the story, the two ships in question have not even been sold.\nDespite being false, the story reached members of the US Congress, where leaders say any decision on further aid to Ukraine will be delayed until next year.\nSome are vehemently opposed to further support. \nOn X, formerly Twitter, Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene said: \"Anyone who votes to fund Ukraine is funding the most corrupt money scheme of any foreign war in our country's history.\" \nShe linked to a story containing the yacht rumour.\nTom Tillis, a Republican Senator and a supporter of military aid to Ukraine, spoke to CNN shortly after senators held a closed-door meeting with Mr Zelensky last week.\n\"I think the notion of corruption came up because some have said we can't do it, because people will buy yachts with the money,\" Mr Tillis said. \"[Mr Zelensky] disabused people of those notions.\"  \nMr Tillis has butted heads with another Republican Senator, J D Vance, who has also mentioned Mr Zelensky and ships in the same breath. \nWhile discussing budget priorities on a podcast hosted by former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon, Mr Vance said: \"There are people who would cut Social Security, throw our grandparents into poverty, why? So that one of Zelensky's ministers can buy a bigger yacht?\"\nAlthough the yacht rumour is false, the BBC has discovered the story was given a major boost by a Russia-linked website that pretends to be located in Washington.\nIt is, researchers say, a \"likely purpose-built tool for narrative laundering with links to the Russian government\".\nThe story first emerged in late November on an obscure YouTube channel - one with only a handful of followers and just a single video in its feed.\nThe next day, it was picked up by a site called DC Weekly, alongside pictures of the two yachts - called Lucky Me and My Legacy - and documents purportedly confirming the sale of the boats to Zelensky's associates. \nBut the luxury yacht brokers where both vessels are listed for sale said that the allegations are false. The sales documents appear to be forgeries. And instead of having been purchased by Zelensky or his close advisers, both Lucky Me and My Legacy are still up for sale.\nThe DC Weekly story touched off a blaze of online speculation, with multiple sources linking to the story and content citing the story across multiple platforms. \nHowever, the site is not, as the name implies, a weekly publication - nor is it based in the US capital. \nResearch by Darren Linvill and Patrick Warren, disinformation researchers at Clemson University, shows that DC Weekly was started  by John Mark Dougan, a former US Marine and Florida police officer who moved to Russia in 2016.\nMr Dougan spent three years as a deputy with the Palm Beach County Sheriff's office, then after he left in 2009 he started a website  spreading rumours about his former employers.\nSince moving to Russia he has reinvented himself as a journalist covering the invasion of Ukraine, and has spread a number of false and baseless claims - for example that Russia was attempting to destroy biological weapons labs.\nDC Weekly, the Clemson researchers discovered, is full of news stories copied from other sites and rewritten by artificial intelligence engines. The site's \"reporters\" have fake names along with headshots copied from elsewhere on the internet.\nMixed in with the rewritten stories - apparently designed to give the site a sheen of legitimacy - are dubious original reports. \nOne such story was the origin of the yacht claim, and the Clemson researchers tracked how the story spread widely after DC Weekly published its version.\nEvidence collected by the researchers indicates that the site continued to be connected to the same server as several of Mr Dougan's other websites. BBC Verify also found that part of the DC Weekly website is hosted on a server in Moscow.\nEarlier this year Mr Dougan was identified as being a DC Weekly commentator when he gave several talks at an academy affiliated with the Russian Foreign Ministry. \n\"It is pretty obvious to me that Dougan has been involved with DC Weekly for a long time, and remains connected to the infrastructure behind it,\" Mr Warren said.\nMr Dougan said via text message that he \"emphatically denies these assertions\", and that he sold DC Weekly for $3,000 several years ago. He said he does not recall the person he sold it to and has lost the paperwork due to being kicked off payment platforms and losing access to email accounts because of financial sanctions against Russia. He says he has nothing to do with the site's current operations.  \nThe researchers say the site is part of a much larger pro-Russia propaganda machine. \n\"Whether this one particular guy is behind it doesn't really matter much,\" Mr Warren said. \"The key point is that it is an important element in a very substantial and effective pro-Russian influence operation that needs to be exposed and understood.\"\nThe Ukrainian President's Office said of the DC Weekly story: \"All information in this article is fake. Zelensky and his family members do not and did not have any yachts.\"\nMr Tillis and Ms Greene were contacted for comment. \nA spokesperson for Mr Vance said: \"For years, everyone in the West recognised that Ukraine was one of the most corrupt countries in the world. Somehow everyone forgot that just as we started sending them billions of dollars in foreign aid.\"\nThe yacht story piles fictional stories onto existing concerns about corruption, which has been a long-running problem in Ukraine. Tackling it is one of the tests the country would have to pass to join Western institutions like the European Union.\nAccording to Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, Ukraine ranks 116th out of 180 countries, although efforts in recent years have seen its position significantly improve.  \nBut the attention given to the country's real and ongoing corruption issues has been mild compared to online chatter over false stories backed up by fake documents and shadowy social media accounts.\nIn October, a widely shared claim on social media stated that President Zelensky's wife spent a fortune on jewellery in New York while the Ukrainian president was in the city speaking to the United Nations.\nLike the yacht rumour, this claim originated on a YouTube channel with very few followers and just one video. The video featured a woman who said she is from Benin. She claimed to work at Cartier on New York's Fifth Avenue.\nThe woman showed a receipt dated 22 September, with Mrs Zelensky's name on it and a bill for $1.1m for a bracelet, earrings and a necklace.\nFacial recognition tools threw up a close match between the woman in the video and photos from social media profiles of a woman who lives in St Petersburg, Russia. When we looked at the pictures of the woman it appeared to be the same person as the one in the YouTube video.\nThe story went viral on Facebook, TikTok and Telegram. Russia's UK embassy X account shared it with the comment: \"Best use of UK taxpayers money ever\".\nBut the receipt is a clear fake. By 21 September, Mr and Mrs Zelensky had left New York and travelled to Canada. \nOne English-language site was instrumental in spreading the rumour - DC Weekly.\nBBC Verify and the Clemson researchers found a number of DC Weekly articles posted between August and December this year that followed the same pattern. \nThe articles falsely alleged that Prince Andrew made a secret visit to Ukraine, that Ukraine provided weapons to Hamas, that an American non-profit organisation harvested organs in Ukraine and that Zelensky's administration allowed Western companies to use Ukrainian farmland for disposal of toxic waste.\nStories on DC Weekly were often published within days after allegations first appeared on YouTube. \nIn addition to DC Weekly, some of the allegations - including those about Cartier jewellery and yachts - also appeared on several pro-Kremlin English-language websites as well as legitimate news websites in Africa that accept \"sponsored\" (paid-for) content.\nSome of the stories were picked up by other outlets and accounts. But with the story about the yachts, the people behind DC Weekly appear to have achieved a level of success that had previously eluded them - their allegations being repeated by some of the most powerful people in the US Congress. \nAdditional reporting by Paul Myers\nWhat questions do you have about the war in Ukraine?\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

The company dominates the Asian market and has invested in game studios across the world.\nFollowing the NPPA announcement, Tencent's share price fell by 12.4%.\nTencent Games' vice president Vigo Zhang said Tencent would strictly implement any new regulatory requirements. The new draft rules have not veered from regulators' ongoing focus on ensuring companies have \"reasonable business models and operating cadence\", he said.\nHe added that minors have been spending a historically low level of money and time on Tencent's games since 2021 when protection of younger players became a focus for Beijing.\nShares in rival NetEase - which has not commented yet on the proposals - were down more than 24%.\nShares of Dutch tech investor Prosus lost more than 14%. Prosus's stock performance is closely linked to that of Tencent - which is its biggest investment in a wide-ranging portfolio of technology stocks.\nThe shockwaves were felt throughout Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, which dropped more than 4% at one point, and was down 1.7% by the close of trade.\nGaming consultant Daniel Camilo told the BBC that both Tencent and NetEase have a lot of free to play games that are \"pay to win\" where gamers are \"actively incentivised to spend money on their games\".\nThe restrictions could affect those types of \"monetisation models\" which would then have to be restructured and \"some of the games might actually have to be pulled out from the stores,\" he said.\nHowever, Mr Camilo thought that both Tencent or NetEase would recover in the long run. However, the same cannot be said for smaller gaming companies.\n\"If a small company is affected in a few millions, then it might mean that they have to close their doors,\" he said.\n\"2023 has been a year full of layoffs and a lot of struggle in particular for the gaming industry in China. So this is kind of a severe blow I would say, especially for the medium and smaller publishers.\"\nThe government's new gaming rules would also potentially speed up the process of giving games the green light in the country by requiring regulators to process approvals within 60 days.\nGame publishers would need to house their servers processing and storing user data in China, rather than elsewhere.\nAccording to Reuters, the administration is seeking public comment on the proposals by 22 January."}

I absolutely love my job,\" she said.\nDr Payne was working for the Care Quality Commission when she got chatting to another doctor who worked on the Orkney islands in Scotland.\n\"I was like, 'Wow, that sort of island job would be my dream but it would never be practical, I've got two kids and my husband works full-time.' And she said, 'No, no, no, hear me out, my job is amazing and we're recruiting.'\"\nDr Payne has now been working for NHS Orkney for four years, often flying between the archipelago's islands.\nShe is on a rota with seven other doctors who each spend one week in eight on Orkney.\nShe spends the rest of her time working from home in Cardiff as a researcher for Oxford University and occasionally working on other islands as a locum - a doctor used to temporarily fill shifts.\nWorking in remote settings brings with it some very particular challenges.\n\"Some of the small islands I work on you might be the only healthcare professional, so your job involves everything from managing emergencies, sorting out helicopters, managing asthma, collecting medication from the ferry, taking blood and taking it to the aeroplane for collection.\n\"It's whatever comes in through the door type of medicine... from a kid who's got a bead up their nose to somebody who's had a massive heart attack.\"\nPoor weather conditions mean getting on or off an island is not always straightforward.\nShe was once trapped on Eadie, one of the islands of Orkney, over new year because a big storm meant her plane was cancelled.\nShe said something common to island communities was people not seeking help as soon as they should.\n\"Sometimes, particularly farmers, will try treating themselves that little bit longer than maybe they should and so people sometimes come in a lot more poorly than they might in other settings,\" she explained.\nDr Payne said the worst situation was somebody deteriorating in a storm and needing a helicopter retrieval.\n\"You'd get them into hospital sooner rather than later on an island setting... everything happens two steps sooner in order to avoid a really sick patient in a really remote location,\" she said.\nIn her four years in the job, Dr Payne has developed a real love for Orkney.\n\"It's just the most magical place you can imagine,\" she said.\n\"The light is amazing... it's got this kind of otherworldliness to it.\"\nShe added patients there really appreciated their doctors.\n\"They know it's not easy to get doctors there, particularly in bad weather and to work somewhere where people are just grateful is so rewarding,\" she said.\nWhen she works on Barra in the Outer Hebrides, an island chain off the west coast of mainland Scotland, her plane has to land on the beach - \"just one of the most incredible experiences of my life\".\nLast summer she fulfilled a dream to spend a month in the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic Ocean approximately 400 miles (650km) off South America.\nHer job involved covering the hospital, A&E and out of hours GP services - her two teenage children and husband were even able to join her for part of it.\nAbout 10 minutes away from the archipelago's only hospital - King Edward VII Hospital - Gentoo penguins can be seen on the beach.\nThe family were able to watch them come in from the sea on their bellies and waddle across the beaches fast as they could to avoid patrolling sealions.\n\"They were just the cutest,\" said Dr Payne.\n\"You wake up and think 'did it really happened?' Was I dreaming from the minute I turned up at Brize Norton to take an RAF flight?'.\"\nAbout 10% of the population of the Falkland Islands live on islands that cover an area about two-thirds of the size of Wales.\nShe described one particular shift when she was working as the flying doctor covering the islands as \"one of the best days of my entire life\".\nThere are no scheduled flights to the smaller islands so people email where they want to go or what they need to be transported and a timetable for the eight-seater Britten-Norman Islander aircraft is constructed around that.\nOn this particular shift she was sitting next to the pilot with a sheep shearer and noisy cat on the way back to being reunited with its owner, but the flight was also used to help a farmer find some missing cows from the air.\nAfter taking blood in the back of a 4x4, there were stops to drop off the cat and house calls to see three more patients.\nThe landing strip was muddy so instead they landed on the beach, doing a fly-over first to scare off any penguins.\n\"I was thinking, 'I cannot believe I could be sitting in a surgery somewhere or I could be wild and free and looking out for penguins on a beach after delivering healthcare to the remotest communities in the world',\" she said.\nOn another memorable day in the Falkland Islands the family drove across beaches and moors in a 4x4 to visit Volunteer Point to see penguins.\n\"There were penguins everywhere, there were king penguins sitting in little groups with all the babies in the middle and the adults around them keeping them safe... totally unforgettable,\" she said.\nWhat can the rest of the world learn from the way healthcare is delivered on islands?\n\"I've never been on an island yet where I felt like a bad doctor because generally you have the time and the setup that allows you to deliver great care, and that gets me out of bed in the morning,\" said Dr Payne.\n\"There are many islands where people living there don't have access to a hospital without getting on a ferry... it's the amazing general practice they receive that makes the difference.\"\nDr Payne will be in the Orkney islands with her family this Christmas and then she her sights on St Helena, a remote volcanic outpost in the South Atlantic Ocean.\nShe believes jobs like hers are \"the real antidote to people getting midcareer blues and thinking about early retirement\".\n\"Mixing it up and using your skills in a different setting can really bring the love back for what we do and so I would say to colleagues that are maybe feelings burnt out or disillusioned to just go for a short locum at one of these places, try something really different, because it really can bring the joy back.\"\nShe added: \"I get to be in these amazing places, working with incredible people and being able to make a difference when it matters most.\""}

And although the shooter's name was on a list of suspects, that list was long.\nFor days, police had searched the Klanovicky forest, after a witness heard shots ringing out.\n\"We were days from uncovering the shooter from the forest,\" said Prague police director Petr Matejcek after the university shootings.\nBallistics tests are being carried out, and if they confirm the 24-year-old student was the killer, he will have left behind a trail of 17 victims in seven days.\nPolice are facing criticism for their handling of the university attack, but they say they had been working 24 hours a day on the forest murders and could not have foreseen what was coming.\n\"We don't have particular proof or information from him why he decided to do something so terrible,\" Interior Minister Vit Rakusan told the BBC.\nHe had no criminal record, no history of violence. Earlier this year he had won a prize for a bachelor's thesis from Prague's Polish Institute.\nIt was more than two and a half hours before the university shootings began on Thursday that police were first alerted to a crime in Hostoun, a village 20km (12 miles) west of the capital.\nAt 12:26 local time, a woman called police to say her friend had sent her a text saying he was going to take his life and was not responding to calls, Police Col Vojtech Motyka told reporters.\nSixteen minutes later, they determined that he was heading to Prague, and at about 13:00 a man's body - the shooter's father - was recovered in Hostoun.\nCol Motyka said a device in the house was found that might be a bomb.\nAt 13:15 a nationwide search was launched for the missing student, and at 13:27 Prague police were asked to search for an armed suspect, presumed to be at the faculty of arts in Prague.\nBut the faculty has several facilities and no police units were sent to the iconic building on Jan Palach Square, close to the Vltava river. Instead, they were all sent to Celetna Street, a few minutes' walk into the Old Town, and began evacuating the building at 14:22.\nShould they have all gone to one faculty, rather than spreading out? The interior minister said at this point they had no indication of anyone else at risk other than the shooter himself, who they were told was due to attend a lecture.\nJust before 15:00, shooting was reported from the larger faculty building on Jan Palach Square.\nIt was at that moment that David Vichnar, an assistant literature professor, described going up two floors in the lift before becoming stuck there for 15 minutes with the lights out while banging noises went on around him.\nMeanwhile, police say it took them four minutes from the first alert at 14:59 to enter the building. The first officers on the scene were carrying handguns.\nDavid Vichnar describes being told by three armed officers to lie face down on the ground. \"There was another person huddled in the corner who told me, 'There's a shooter on the roof,'\" he told Radio Prague International.\nBodycam footage shows armed officers in protective gear climbing the stairs of the faculty, entering classrooms and going on to balconies. Many of the students had managed to barricade themselves in.\nIn one room, police are seen treating some of the shooter's victims and one is seen being carried out of the building on a stretcher.\nAmong those killed was eminent musicologist Lenka Hlavkova, who specialised in medieval music. Only an hour before, she had sent an email to a colleague about plans for the Prague Spring music festival next May.\nThe shooter had a licence for eight guns, although it is not yet clear how many he had with him inside the building.\nIt was unknown how he was able to get hold of such a large arsenal and the interior minister says he could have killed many more students.\nPrague police director Petr Matejcek described being inside the faculty as the attack unfolded and being shocked at the \"incredible\" piles of ammunition in the corridors. How he managed to bring his guns and ammunition into the building is part of the investigation.\nBy 15:11 the attacker was on the roof and opening fire and it took police time to reach him.\nOver the next nine minutes, students are seen scrambling to safety, some of them leaping from an upper ledge to a lower floor.\nThree people on the ground were wounded, as the gunman targeted a police car and another vehicle.\nOne man filming from the ground shouted out, attempting to distract the man from the students trying to escape. \"I am here, shoot here, come over here!\"\nAt 15:20, the shooter was dead: he saw armed officers coming and turned the gun on himself, say police.\nIt took some time for them to secure the building, but eventually students were escorted to safety with their hands raised as a precaution.\nFourteen students and staff lost their lives in the attack on Charles University: 13 were murdered in the building, while another died later in hospital. Twenty-five others were injured.\nCzech reports said one of the victims had died falling from the building and others had also been hurt trying to escape."}

The former president is claiming he is immune from prosecution because he was acting in his official capacity as president before and during the riot.\nIn court filings, Mr Smith argued the Supreme Court should consider the case because it presented \"a fundamental question at the heart of our democracy: whether a former president is absolutely immune\" from being prosecuted for federal crimes allegedly committed while in the White House.\n\"The United States recognizes that this is an extraordinary request,\" he added. \"This is an extraordinary case.\"\nIn a post on his social media site, Truth Social, Mr Trump said the Supreme Court had rejected a \"desperate attempt to short circuit our Great Constitution\", adding that he was \"entitled to Presidential Immunity\".\nMr Trump's lawyers had argued the request to expedite the trial was politically motivated, claiming in court filings that it was part of an effort to \"ensure that President Trump - the leading Republican candidate for President, and the greatest electoral threat to President Biden - will face a months-long criminal trial at the height of his presidential campaign\".\nThe ruling means the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit will have to hear the case before it can be appealed to the Supreme Court. It is expected that the US's highest court will eventually have to issue a ruling.\nThe appeals process may delay the start date of the trial, however, which prosecutors had hoped to hold before the election.\nThe concern for prosecutors is that the closer it gets to election day, the more mired in politics the case becomes. And if Mr Trump's attorneys succeed in pushing the date past the election the trial could be delayed indefinitely.\nThe possibility also looms that, with pressure from a newly inaugurated President Trump, a delayed case could be dropped entirely.\n\"Trump's delay strategy appears to be working,\" Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia, told the BBC.\n\"All of [this] will consume time, and, thus, complicate efforts to start the trial before Judge Chutkan on the early March date.\"\nThe appeal comes after Judge Chutkan had previously rejected Mr Trump's immunity claims, writing in a ruling that the former president's \"four-year service as Commander in Chief did not bestow on him the divine right of kings to evade the criminal accountability that governs his fellow citizens\".\nIn the meantime, however, arguments are set to be heard in the case in DC Circuit Court on 9 January.\nMr Trump currently faces dozens of criminal charges across four cases, including two related to his alleged election subversion efforts.\nFriday's decision by the high court suggests that its nine justices are reluctant to insert themselves into Mr Trump's ongoing legal drama if at all possible.\nThat may hint at how the court handles some of the numerous high-profile legal challenges involving Mr Trump that will end up on the court's doorstep in the coming months.\nThe former president faces other charges in Florida, also brought by Mr Smith, for his handling of classified documents.\nThe decision on Friday also comes after the Colorado Supreme Court ruled earlier this week that Mr Trump could no longer appear on the state's 2024 Republican primary ballot because of a constitutional insurrection clause.\nThe justices ruled Mr Trump was ineligible as a candidate because of his actions related to the Capitol riots.\nThe former president has appealed that case to the US Supreme Court."}

She's worked on this production line since 1978. \nShe effortlessly blows glass baubles using a gas burner fixed to her desk. It's a welcome source of heat in these cold, industrial surroundings. \nAfter years of shrinking output, this factory stopped completely when Russian forces occupied this area for a month soon after the start of the country's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. \n\"It was very scary when tanks drove down the street,\" Henya, another worker, explains. \"We couldn't go outside. We had no information, we were cut off from the world. It was terrible.\"\nAnd yet, despite only a third of the team having returned, decorations are still being made. Small pieces of Christmas cheer are carefully built and sent out around the country. \nAnd what is Henya's wish for Ukrainians living under Russian occupation this Christmas?\n\"You have to believe, hope - and liberation will happen, it will be like that.\" \nHenya works on the more artistic part of the process: she and her colleagues caringly hand paint each individual bauble. \nYou immediately notice a military theme. Miniature soldiers, MIG fighter jets, even a Ukrainian tractor pulling a Russian tank - all hang from a shelf, destined for a Christmas tree. \n\"I think that everyone who will take a look at such a bauble will hope for the victory of our country sooner,\" says Tamila with a defiant tone now typical here in Ukraine.\nUkraine and Russia share countless cultural ties, and they will always have to live next to each other. Yet the former's identity is only being strengthened by the latter's aggression. \nFewer places know that aggression better than the town of Bucha, a couple of miles from the decoration factory. \nAs the Russian advance towards Kyiv slowed last year, invading troops were accused of killing more than 500 civilians in one of the worst atrocities of the war so far. \nSome of their names appear on a silver memorial next to the Church of St Andrew. As its golden domes glisten in the winter sunshine, you can still see where grass has struggled to regrow. \nIt was here that a mass grave appeared during Russia's occupation. The bodies of those who died could only be exhumed after they retreated. \n\"Unfortunately for many people in the world, Ukraine is linked to Russia. And Ukraine is always viewed in the context of being a neighbour of Russia,\" explains Father Andriy in the candlelit crypt of St Andrew's. \n\"But I think that we are more a neighbour of Europe,\" he says. \"And the fact that we've now changed the calendar is not shifting away from Russia. It is us returning back to Europe, where we belong.\"\nGiven Russia will always be close by, I ask whether he could ever forgive the invading country for what it's done to his homeland.\n\"God forgives a sinner, but only those who repent. We do not see yet that the Russians are trying to repent for their sins and mistakes, so I think it's too early to talk about forgiveness.\"\nFor Ukraine, any Russian repentance must start with an end of its ongoing invasion.

This figure, calculated by subtracting liabilities from assets, varies considerably across the population, shaping the retirement lifestyle and economic security of millions.\nFinance expert and author Geoff Schmidt evaluates retiree wealth using the most recent data from the Federal Reserve Board’s Survey of Consumer Finances.\nDon't Miss:\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare?\nCan you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you.\nPoor: Households in the 20th percentile, with a net worth of around $10,000, are categorized as poor. This group likely doesn’t own a home and focuses financial resources on necessities​​.\nMiddle class: The middle class is in the 50th percentile, with a median household net worth of $281,000 for Americans aged 65 and up. This typically includes home equity, savings and a 401(k) account​​​​.\nWealthy: To be considered well off, a person must be in the 90th percentile, possessing a household net worth of $1.9 million. This level of wealth affords trips, charity donations and college funds for children. The 95th percentile, with a net worth of $3.2 million, is considered wealthy, facilitating estate planning and possibly owning multiple homes. The top 1%, or the 99th percentile, has a net worth of $16.7 million and represents the very wealthy, who enjoy considerable financial freedom and luxury​​.\nBased on Zippia data for 2023:\nAmericans aged 55-64: This group has an estimated average net worth of $1.18 million. This figure is significant as it represents people who are typically nearing the end of their working years and are at the peak of their wealth accumulation phase​​​​​​.\nAmericans aged 65-74: This group has a higher average net worth than the 55-64 age group, at $1.22 million. The increase in average net worth for this age group is likely because of continued asset growth and possibly the beginning of drawing down retirement accounts​​​​​​.\n75 and older: This demographic has an average net worth of $977,600, which is lower than the younger age groups. This decrease can be attributed to the fact that people in this age group are further into their retirement and may be drawing down their assets more significantly​\nAccording to Schwab's 2023 Modern Wealth Survey, Americans perceive an average net worth of $2.2 million as wealthy​​​​.\nKnight Frank’s research indicates that a net worth of $4.4 million is required to be in the top 1% in America, a figure much higher than in countries like Japan, the U.K. and Australia​​.\nA growing number of Americans are entering retirement with debt. The proportion of households led by people aged 65 and older with debt increased from 38% in 1989 to 61% in 2016. CNBC reports debt among those aged 70 and up surged by 614% from 1999 to 2021, with mortgages constituting the majority of the debt​​.\nNet worth at retirement age in the U.S. varies considerably and is shaped by elements such as homeownership, savings and debt. While the middle class and wealthy often experience financial security, a notable segment of the population confronts economic difficulties. This disparity underscores the critical role of financial planning and management, including the valuable assistance of financial advisers, in ensuring a stable financial future throughout life.\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article Are You Wealthy?
