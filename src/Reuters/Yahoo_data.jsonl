Trump frequently crowed about advances in stocks during his presidency but has changed his tune during President Biden's time in office.The major stock indices tumbled in 2022 but have rallied strongly this year. The benchmark S&P 500 is up 24% to a near-record level, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has surged 43%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 13% to an all-time high as well.Biden celebrated the strong performance by posting a campaign ad on X last week. It started with a clip of Trump warning in 2020 that \"if Biden wins, you're gonna have a stock-market collapse the likes of which you've never had.\" The video then cut to Biden smiling as cable news commentators hailed the stunning rally.\"Good one, Donald,\" Biden wrote.It's worth noting that many Americans don't personally own stocks, meaning they only benefit indirectly from market gains, for example if they boost their retirement accounts. Trump certainly isn't wrong to say that rising stocks enrich the wealthy, either.The world's 10 richest people have gained an estimated $470 billion in cumulative net worth this year, lifting their combined fortunes to nearly $1.5 trillion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Their wealth has soared in large part because they own large stakes in public companies that have seen their stock prices soar this year.For example, Warren Buffett's shares of his company, Berkshire Hathaway, make up over 98% of the investor's $119 billion net worth. Berkshire's shares have climbed 15% this year, making Buffett $12 billion richer on paper despite his gifting of $5.5 billion of stock to philanthropic causes.It's not surprising to see Trump try to disparage the stock market when Biden is actively pointing to it as evidence of his successful presidency. It may not be a surprise either to see Trump return to his previous stance on stocks if he's reelected.Read the original article on Business Insider"}

If you have $1 million, you likely want to know how much your monthly payout will be. Monthly cash flow from a $1 million annuity varies depending on several factors, including the type of annuity purchased, the age at which the annuity payments begin and current interest rates.Don't Miss:The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare?Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you.The monthly payments from a $1 million annuity can range significantly. For people who start their annuity payments later in life, say between the ages of 60 and 70, the monthly disbursements can be higher because of the shorter payment period expected. According to SmartAsset, they might expect to receive between $4,500 and $6,500 per month for the rest of their lives or the specified duration of the annuity contract. This window gives a broad idea but emphasizes the need for personalized quotes to understand exact figures.Annuities are popular for providing a sense of security through guaranteed income, which is particularly appealing for those concerned about preserving their lifestyle post-retirement and the risk of outliving their savings. A well-chosen annuity can become the cornerstone of a secure retirement plan, but it must be tailored to individual financial situations and goals. For an accurate estimation tailored to your circumstances, using an income annuity calculator or consulting with a financial adviser would be the best course of action.Annuities can provide a steady stream of income in retirement, with payout structures influenced by multiple factors.Annuities come in several forms, each tailored to different financial goals and risk tolerance levels. Immediate annuities start payouts shortly after a lump sum investment, while deferred annuities allow assets to grow before income begins. You can choose between fixed annuities, offering guaranteed payouts, and variable annuities, where payments depend on investment performance. Indexed annuities are another option, with payouts linked to a specific market index’s performance.The method by which annuities pay out can greatly affect their suitability for a retiree’s needs. You can opt for life annuities to receive payments for as long as you live, or you can select term-certain annuities for guaranteed income over a set period. Joint and survivor annuities also are available, ensuring that spouses or other beneficiaries continue to receive payments after the original annuitant’s death.Myriad factors impact the monthly income from an annuity. Your age at purchase is critical; the younger you are when you buy an annuity, the smaller the monthly payments tend to be because they’re spread over a longer expected lifetime. Interest rates also play a significant role — higher rates typically lead to more substantial monthly payments. Initial investment amount, chosen riders or additional contract features, and the insuring company’s financial strength further dictate the payment amounts.When considering a $1 million annuity, you must understand the factors that influence monthly payments, such as whether the annuity is immediate or deferred, current interest rates and your life expectancy.Immediate annuities start payments almost immediately after the initial investment. If you invest in an immediate annuity, you can expect to receive a fixed monthly payment based on agreed-upon terms. Deferred annuities, on the other hand, involve payments starting at a future date. This delay allows the investment to grow over time before payouts begin, often resulting in a higher monthly payment.The monthly income from an annuity is significantly affected by the interest rates at the time of purchase. A higher interest rate can increase monthly payments as the investment accrues more interest. Annuity calculators can help estimate monthly payments by factoring in these rates.Insurers use life expectancy as a key determinant in calculating annuity payments. The longer a person is expected to live, the more the $1 million must be spread out, potentially reducing the size of each payment. Conversely, a shorter life expectancy might result in larger monthly payments. This calculation ensures the full value of the annuity is paid out over the person's lifetime.Annuities can have complex tax implications. Withdrawals from a nonqualified annuity are typically taxed as ordinary income, and you may also face penalties if you take them before age 59½. Conversely, funds from a qualified annuity may be taxed differently because they are often purchased with pretax dollars.Careful planning is crucial to maximize annuity payouts. Immediate annuities generally offer a higher monthly payment because they begin disbursing funds soon after investment. On the other hand, deferred annuities can be beneficial for people who can afford to wait, as they accrue interest over time, potentially increasing the monthly disbursement amount.If you have excess cash from your annuity payments, reinvesting can yield additional growth. You might consider low-risk investments such as bonds or fixed deposits or potentially higher-yield — yet riskier — options like stocks or mutual funds. This strategy should align with your overall long-term financial goals and risk tolerance.\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?APPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis ReportTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis ReportThis article How Much Cash Will A $1 Million Annuity Bring In Each Month? originally appeared on Benzinga.com© 2023 Benzinga.com.

But keep in mind that the payment of a special dividend will decrease the share price by a similar amount, just as the regular dividend payment does. The share price may rise in the week before the ex-dividend date, so it behooves investors who wish to receive the special dividend to purchase shares as soon as possible.Collecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler. A new real estate fund backed by Jeff Bezos gives you instant access to a diversified portfolio of rental properties, and you only need $100 to get started.Miami’s housing market value has soared over 86% in the last two years and some investors found a simple strategy to profit from it. Here’s how you can do the same in these four cities poised for massive growth.Take a look at five REITs that have upcoming ex-dividend dates for special dividend payments in the last week of 2023. Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. (NYSE:PK) is a Tysons, Virginia-based hotel REIT with 43 hotels (plus two held in receivership) and resorts with over 26,000 rooms in prime U.S. markets with high barriers to entry. Properties in Hawaii account for 36% of its portfolio.Park was established as an independent company in January 2017 following its spinoff from Hilton Hotels Corp. (NYSE:HLT). In September 2019, Park acquired Chesapeake Lodging Trust to add premium-brand hotels and resorts in prime markets such as Miami, Boston, Los Angeles and San Francisco.On Dec. 1, Park Hotels declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.15 and a top-off dividend of $0.78, along with a previously announced $0.77 special cash dividend to be paid on Jan. 16 to shareholders of record on Dec. 29. The ex-dividend date for all three payments is Dec. 28, and Park Hotels shareholders will receive three dividend payments on Jan. 16.Host Hotels & Resorts Inc. (NASDAQ:HST) is a Bethesda, Maryland-based lodging REIT with 77 hotels containing 42,000 rooms in large markets across the U.S. Host Hotels is the only lodging REIT in the S&P 500 and has been in the index since 2007. Its hotel brands include Marriott, Hyatt, Four Seasons and Hilton.Host Hotels shareholders will receive two rewards in January. On Dec. 15, Host Hotels & Resorts announced an 11% increase in its fourth-quarter dividend from $0.18 to $0.20 per share and a special dividend of $0.25 per share. The dividends are payable on Jan. 16 to shareholders of record on Dec. 29. The ex-dividend date for both payments is Dec. 28. The dividend hike and special dividend increase the annual yield from 3.7% to 5.45%.Rayonier Inc. (NYSE:RYN) is a Yulee, Florida-based specialty REIT that invests in timberland in the U.S. and New Zealand. At the end of the third quarter, Rayonier owned long-term agreements on 2.8 million acres of timberland. Rayonier was established in 1926.On Dec. 18, Rayonier announced a one-time special cash dividend of $0.20 per common share, payable on Jan. 12 to shareholders of record on Dec. 29. The special dividend is the result of Rayonier's disposition of 55,000 acres of timberland in Oregon in the fourth quarter.SITE Centers Corp. (NYSE:SITC) is a Beachwood, Ohio-based retail REIT with 106 wholly owned shopping centers, 65% of which are anchored by grocery stores or high-quality discounters in affluent areas of the U.S. Its third-quarter lease rate was 94.4%. In October, SITE Centers announced it would spin off 61 convenience sector properties into a separate REIT called Curbline Properties. The spinoff is expected to take one full year, and Curbline is slated to start with a net cash position and no debt.On Dec. 13, SITE Centers declared a special dividend of $0.16 per share, payable on Jan. 12 to shareholders of record on Dec. 27, with an ex-dividend date on Dec. 26. The special dividend is from the sale of about 15% of SITE Centers' asset base this year. Farmland Partners Inc. (NYSE:FPI) is a Denver-based, internally managed specialty REIT that invests in farmland and originates loans to farmers that are secured by farm real estate. Farmland Partners is the No. 1 farmland REIT by total acreage, owning or managing over 300 farms totaling 178,216 acres in 20 states. Its properties produce 26 crops and have over 100 tenants. Farmland also owns properties in Ohio leased by four agriculture equipment dealerships.On Dec. 12, Farmland Partners announced a special dividend of $0.21 per share, payable on Jan. 12 to shareholders of record on Dec. 29. The ex-dividend date is Dec. 28. The special dividend is because of the sale of 35 farms in 2023 for $71.1 million with an aggregate gain of $10.3 million. The special dividend is on top of the regular $0.06 per share quarterly dividend payable on Jan. 16 to shareholders of record on Jan. 2, with an ex-dividend date of Dec. 29.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it's too late.

It built a small test track near Las Vegas to develop its transportation technology, and for a time took the name Virgin Hyperloop One after Richard Branson’s Virgin invested. Virgin removed its branding after the startup decided last year to focus on cargo rather than people.Now, the company has laid off most of its employees, and is trying to sell its remaining assets, including the test track and machinery, according to one of the people, who asked to remain anonymous discussing private information. In early 2022, the company employed more than 200 people. The business has also closed its Los Angeles office. The remaining workers, tasked with overseeing the asset sale, were told their employment will end on Dec. 31.DP World, the Dubai-based conglomerate, has backed Hyperloop One since 2016 and owns a majority stake. The startup’s remaining intellectual property will be transferred to DP World, a person familiar with the situation said.Through a spokesman, DP World declined to comment. Raja Narayanan, Hyperloop One’s acting chief executive officer, also didn’t respond to requests for comment.Hyperloop One, formally known as Hyperloop Technologies, merged with a shell company this April, according to a document reviewed by Bloomberg. At that time, the value of shares in most classes was written down to zero cents, and the shareholders of the shell company became the only owners of Hyperloop One. At an all-hands meeting, employees were told that DP World orchestrated the transaction, according to one of the people.The company had captured the public’s imagination since its founding in 2014, a year after Elon Musk released a white paper outlining a vision for hyperloop technology. The concept was a tantalizing promise of a new kind of transportation technology — and an end to traffic.But the nascent industry stumbled, and Hyperloop One never won a contract to build a working hyperloop. The company also attracted plenty of attention for the wrong reasons. Co-founder Brogan BamBrogan once arrived at work to find a noose on his chair. And another co-founder, the venture capitalist Shervin Pishevar, stepped aside after Bloomberg reported on sexual harassment allegations against him, which he denied. A one-time director, Ziyavudin Magomedov, was arrested in Moscow on charges of fraud and embezzlement unrelated to Hyperloop One. At the time, Magomedov’s lawyer said he was appealing the arrest.Although no large-scale hyperloop has been built after years of effort, the concept continues to enchant entrepreneurs. Several hyperloop companies are at various stages of building protoypes, including Hardt Hyperloop, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies Inc. and Swisspod Technologies.Musk has promoted the field as well, creating a series of competitions for student-designed hyperloops and building a now-demolished test track. He also started Boring Co., a tunneling business that has pursued related technology.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekOne Man’s Longevity Obsession Now Includes Fountain-of-Youth InjectionsWhat Dermatologists Really Think About Those Anti-Aging ProductsThe Most Secretive Longevity Lab Finally Opens Its DoorsWhat the Oldest Lab Rodents Are Teaching Humans About Staying YoungMichael J.

Buyers are shunning them due to a lack of subsidies, a desire to wait for better technology and continued shortfalls in charging infrastructures. A fierce price war sparked by Tesla Inc. and competitive Chinese models are further depressing values of new and used cars alike, threatening earnings at rivals like Volkswagen AG and Stellantis NV.Because most new vehicles in Europe are sold via leases, automakers and dealers who finance these transactions are trying to recover losses from plummeting valuations by raising borrowing costs. That’s hitting demand in some European markets that were in the vanguard of the shift away from fossil fuel-powered propulsion. Some of the biggest buyers of new cars, including rental firms, are cutting back on EV adoption because they’re losing money on resales, with Sixt SE dropping Tesla models from its fleet.“When a car loses 1% of its worth, I make 1% less profit,” said Christian Dahlheim, who heads VW’s financial services arm. The issues with secondhand EVs, he said, have the potential to destroy billions of euros in earnings for the broader industry.The problems are expected to intensify next year, when many of the 1.2 million EVs sold in Europe in 2021 will come off their three-year leasing contracts and enter the secondhand market. How companies tackle this problem will be key for their bottom lines, consumer confidence and ultimately decarbonization — including the European Union’s plan to phase out sales of new fuel-burning cars by 2035.“There isn’t used-car demand for EVs,” said Matt Harrison, Toyota Motor Corp.’s chief operating officer in Europe. “That’s really hurting the cost-of-ownership story.”Companies can funnel battery-powered cars into mobility offerings and ride-sharing startups, but there’s limited demand from these businesses. Unwanted combustion cars often end up in Africa, where their poor state causes pollution issues. That market is largely shut to EVs because it has no viable infrastructure to charge them.China offers a cautionary tale. Lucrative subsidies turned the country into an EV giant, but also produced weed-infested graveyards of abandoned battery-powered vehicles. Any similar eyesores in Europe or the US may strengthen calls from conservative politicians to roll back aid for the industry, with key elections coming up in the US and Europe in 2024.Read more: China’s EV Graveyards Show Dark Side of Frenetic DevelopmentWarning signs around EVs appeared early this year when Tesla started aggressively cutting prices in an effort to prop up sales. That sparked a price war as other manufacturers followed, eating into profitability for some and pushing up already steep losses for others.Prices for secondhand EVs slumped by around a third in the year through October, compared with a decline of just 5% in the overall used market, according to sales data from iSeeCars.com, a website that ranks cars and dealers. Used EVs take longer to sell than gasoline models even after significant price cuts, the group said.In Germany, Europe’s biggest auto market, most new vehicles are first sold as company or fleet cars and then re-enter the private secondhand market one to three years later. But with orders even for new EVs slowing, more and more used models are sitting on lots longer than 90 days, meaning they’ve become “risk inventory,” according to the Deutsche Automobil Treuhand market researcher.“One has to slash prices significantly just to get customers to look at EVs,” said Dirk Weddigen von Knapp, who heads a group representing VW and Audi dealers.Part of the problem is that the industry is handling secondhand EVs for the first time. While combustion-engine cars can be quickly valued via their age and mileage, there are no tests in widespread use that determine the quality of a battery, Weddigen von Knapp said. The battery represents around 30% of an EV’s value, a share that is expected to decline in the coming years, according to BloombergNEF.To be sure, some EVs are performing well years after their introduction, with less-than-expected battery degradation, said Mike Tyndall, an analyst at HSBC. Teslas can sell quickly in the secondhand market because of the brand’s reputation as a technology leader and its regular wireless software updates. The quirky i3 electric car BMW AG introduced a decade ago has even developed a cult following.Still, most consumers remain reticent buying used EVs. Manufacturers are already working on new battery technologies including solid-state that promise cheaper cars with longer ranges and faster charging. The likes of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and BMW have announced plans to introduce several next-generation EVs around mid-decade, while Volkswagen, Stellantis and Renault are developing models costing €25,000 or less.Read more: VW Shows €25,000 EV to Compete Where Tesla Has Left an OpeningAyvens, a fleet management company handling around 3.5 million vehicles, said the uncertainty around EV technology will convince more customers to lease rather than buy — accelerating a shift away from owning a car to driving it for a fee.“EVs are a booster of the transition of ownership to usership,” said Annie Pin, Ayvens’ chief commercial officer.--With assistance from Craig Trudell.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekOne Man’s Longevity Obsession Now Includes Fountain-of-Youth InjectionsWhat Dermatologists Really Think About Those Anti-Aging ProductsThe Most Secretive Longevity Lab Finally Opens Its DoorsWhat the Oldest Lab Rodents Are Teaching Humans About Staying YoungMichael J.

Of course, he'd argue that he's actually a business picker instead of a stock picker. The businesses he picks, though, tend to translate to good stocks.The legendary investor doesn't just pick individual stocks -- he also likes some exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Buffett really likes one ETF, in particular. But there's an ETF that's just as good and could help you retire as a millionaire.There are only two ETFs in Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio: the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT: SPY) and the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO). Both are index ETFs that track the S&P 500.Which of these two funds is Buffett's favorite? I think the evidence points to the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF.For one thing, Berkshire owns a little more of the Vanguard ETF than it does of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. At the end of the third quarter, the conglomerate's stake in VOO was worth slightly more than $17.5 billion, while its position in SPY was worth under $17.5 million.Also, Buffett seemed to express his opinion in his 2013 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. In that letter, he wrote that he had instructed in his will that most of the fortune inherited by his family be invested in a low-cost S&P 500 index fund. He added, \"I suggest Vanguard's.\"Why would Buffett prefer the Vanguard fund to another that owned the same stocks? Cost. Vanguard is well known for its low annual expense fees. In that 2013 letter, he emphasized that it's important to \"keep your costs minimal.\"VOO certainly beats SPY on this front. The Vanguard fund's annual expense ratio is only 0.03%, compared to 0.0945% for the SPDR ETF.However, when it comes to cost, there's another alternative that's just as good as VOO. BlackRock's iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: IVV) also tracks the S&P 500. Its expense ratio is also 0.03%.There are only two meaningful differentiators between these two ETFs. One is average trading volume. The average volume for VOO is around 4.8 million shares, while the average volume for IVV is slightly under 5 million shares.The other is assets under management (AUM). VOO's AUM is around $937 billion, compared to IVV's AUM of nearly $397 billion. Neither of these differences should matter to long-term investors, though.Buffett told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders roughly a decade ago that any investor who owns a large, diversified basket of stocks via an S&P index fund is \"bound to do well\" over time. He was right.It's possible to retire as a millionaire by investing in VOO or IVV. For example, let's assume that you invest $5,350 per year in either ETF for 30 years. If the S&P 500 delivers the same average annual return of 10.7% as it has over the last 30 years, you'd end the period with a little over $1 million.The low expense ratio for VOO and IVV wouldn't matter materially to your total returns. Taxes could be a factor, though. However, investing in a tax-protected account, such as an IRA or a 401(k), would solve that problem.Of course, there's no guarantee that the S&P 500 will deliver the same level of returns going forward as it has in the past. Still, investing regularly in VOO or IVV over a long period is likely to pay off nicely.Should you invest $1,000 in iShares Trust-iShares Core S&P 500 ETF right now?Before you buy stock in iShares Trust-iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and iShares Trust-iShares Core S&P 500 ETF wasn't one of them.

These are increasingly important with the growth in solar power and wind energy, which only generate electricity when weather conditions are favorable and need to store it for when residential and commercial users need it.The Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer backed by Warren Buffett is to build a car factory in Hungary, the company has said, as it plans to ram up its market share in Europe.With the new factory, the rival of Tesla “hopes to accelerate the entry of new energy passenger vehicles into the European market, further deepen (the firm’s) global layout, and actively promote the green transformation of the global energy structure”, it said on Chinese social media, according to AFP.Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway originally bought into BYD stake in 2008, but has been selling down his stake from a reported 21pc in late 2021 to under 8pc by the end of November.Mr Buffett told CNBC in April that he had been selling shares in BYD because of the valuation of his stake had become around $6.5bn, saying “I think it’s an extraordinary company ... we haven’t sold all our BYD by a long shot. We are not in a hurry to sell it.”Retailers are hoping for a “last minute dash” from shoppers after some disappointing sales figures in recent months.It comes after gloomy data was released by the CBI suggesting that retailers have endured eight consecutive months of year-on-year sales going down.But the latest data from the ONS suggests that November might actually have seen some green shoots.Darren Morgan, of the ONS, said:Retail sales grew strongly in November as heavy Black Friday discounting encouraged shoppers to spend. However, with the three-month trend continuing to fall and overall sales still below pre-pandemic levels, it’s still a challenging time for retailers.The trade body representing major retailers nonetheless struck an upbeat note. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said:Many retailers tried to give sales a needed boost in November by starting their Black Friday sales even earlier this year. Cosmetics and toiletries had another strong month as consumers continued to splurge on smaller indulgences.Retailers anticipate that consumers will be making a last-minute dash to their favourite stores in the final days leading up to Christmas.The FTSE 100 was up 2.78pc today. Lloyds Banking Group was the biggest riser, up 1.81pc, followed by investment fund Pershing Square, up 1.73pc. The biggest faller was JD Sports, down 5.15pc, followed by Ocado, down 4.25pc.Meanwhile, the FTSE 250 rose 0.31pc, with PureTech Health leading the pack, up 20.95pc, followed by Harbour Energy, up 5.82pc. Industrial refractory business RHI Magnesita fell 4.55pc, followed by industrial thread company Coats Group, down 3.68pc.Lionsgate will spin off its studio unit - famous for the John Wick and Hunger Games films - into a a so-called “blank cheque” company listed on Nasdaq.The studio business is to be marged into Screaming Eagle Acquisition Corp, a special purpose-acquisition company (Spac) to create a listed company representing Lionsgate’s television and film assets that include a vast back catalogue.The existing Lionsgate, officially known as the Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation, is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and will retail its pay-for cable and satellite channels, according to reports.Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation will gain £350m from the split and retain 87.3pc of the Spac, which is expected to be renamed Lionsgate Studios.Pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb will acquire drugmaker Karuna Therapeutics for $14bn (£11bn), the two American companies announced this afternoon.Bristol will gain Karuna’s experimental drug KarXT, which has the potential to be a game changing medicine to treat schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease and bipolar disorder.Bristol chief Christopher Boerner said: “We expect KarXT to enhance our growth through the late 2020s and into the next decade.”KarXT could hit the market for schizophrenia treatment as soon as September, depending on regulatory approvals.Meanwhile, clinical trials for Alzheimer’s treatment are underway, with data expected by 2026.An advert for North Sea oil giant Equinor has been banned by regulators over “misleading” environmental claims. Our reporter James Warrington has the details:The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) censured Equinor over an ad that suggested wind and carbon capture played a balanced role in the company’s energy output when oil and gas still make up the vast majority of its business.The ruling applied to an advert in The Economist in June, which said that “wind, oil, gas, carbon capture and new jobs” were “all part of the broader energy picture”.In September, Equinor secured approval to develop Britain’s largest untapped oil field in the North Sea, sparking fury from environmental activists.In response to the ruling, the state-owned Norwegian company said the advert was aimed at politicians, advisers and journalists, rather than the general public.The company added that the words “oil” and “gas” featured prominently in the advert and that text at the bottom said that it was “producing the oil and gas the UK needs now”.The advert also featured a picture of a worker on an oil rig.But in its ruling, the ASA argued that the ad would be seen by consumer and business readers, as well as decision-makers.It said the ads were “likely to mislead” after omitting “significant information”.A spokesman for Equinor said: “We respect, but are disappointed by, the ruling of the Advertising Standards Authority Council. We will take note of it for future campaigns.”The dollar fell on Friday, hitting a nearly five-month low against a range of other countries after data showed annual American inflation slowed further in November. This had the effect of cementing market expectations for a US interest rate cut next March.Inflation in the US was just 2pc in the third quarter of 2023 according to new figures.In the 12 months to November, inflation stood at 2.6pc, down from 2.9pc in October.Stuart Cole, chief macro economist at Equiti Capital, explained:The market will view the data as very much adding weight to the Fed’s recent tilt towards an easier monetary stance.This is the Fed’s preferred measure of inflationary pressures, so if you take into account the fact that some of the effect of the tightening delivered to date is still to be felt, then I think the FOMC may well be starting to privately feel that it’s job done as regards getting inflation back under control.BE Offices, which provides “all-inclusive, inspirational office space solutions” across London and in Birmingham, Belfast and Southampton, has gone into administration, according to a report.It has previously been in a voluntary arrangement with creditors.The company was not answering its main telephone line this afternoon.It follows the collapse of WeWork, which entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States, after its model of taking out long-term leases and selling on fashionable space with office buildings on a short-term basis came unstuck.Sales of new American homes cooled more than anticipated in November, slipping to the lowest level in a year, according to official data that lends further support to the growing consensus that the Fed will soon start cutting interest.The market for new properties has been boosted in recent months by a lack of existing homes, as high mortgage rates dissuaded homeowners - who previously locked in lower rates - from putting their houses up for sale.Last month, sales of new single-family houses came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 590,000, around 12 percent below October’s figure, the US Commerce Department said. This was slightly above November 2022’s pace of 582,000, however.While the latest weakness appears to reflect elevated mortgage rates earlier in the year, rates have since come down.If you’re worried about growth in the FTSE 100, spare a thought for what’s happening in China.The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index, which tracks listed companies based in China but with shares traded in the US, is down more than 11pc in 2023. This has occurred in a year where the Nasdaq Composite index (heavily skewed towards American technology firms) is up 45pc.Today that Chinese index has dropped 2.4pc, prompting Rajeev De Mello, a fund manager at the Geneva-based GAMA Asset Management, to tell Bloomberg: “In a way it is a fitting end for a year that has severely disappointed China bulls. The performance gap between US and China equities is staggering.”I’m heading off for the festive holidays so I’ll take this opportunity to wish you a very happy Christmas.Fear not, though, as Alex Singleton will be doing his best Santa impression as he delivers you little presents of news as they arise.Speaking of which, I need to grab a few last gifts before the big day, much like these shoppers bustling around Covent Garden in London today:A staff revolt is looming at The Guardian over the newspaper’s return to the office amid concerns the new policy will give some workers less time to spend with their pets.Our reporter James Warrington has the details:Bosses have told staff they must come into the office for a minimum of three days a week from January after many failed to return following the pandemic.But the mandate has been met with anger by the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), which has asked members for their views on the issue.In a survey distributed earlier this month, Guardian staff were asked how much they agreed with various statements about the impact of returning to the office.These ranged from concerns about the financial impact of commuting, to issues around work-life balance and distractions in the office.Read how the Guardian has been plunged into in-fighting over the policy.Swedish regulators are investigating alleged suspension failures in Tesla cars in a probe similar to that of neighbouring Norway’s traffic safety regulator.The country’s Transport Agency told Reuters “that investigative work is also underway with us”.A spokesperson for the Swedish regulator declined to comment on details of the probe as it was still ongoing.The Norwegian Public Roads Administration (NPRA) on Thursday said it started questioning Tesla in September 2022 and asked the carmaker to assess consumer complaints about lower rear control arms breaking on its Model S and X vehicles.The Norwegian agency could recommend that Tesla recall the vehicles to replace the parts if it determines they pose a “serious risk.”However, it could also close the review if there is no safety issue or decide to extend the investigation.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq opened higher after a key US inflation reading came in softer than expected, boosting recent investor optimism that the Federal Reserve could lower borrowing costs next year.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 55.08 points, or 0.2pc, at the open to 37,349.27.The S&P 500 opened higher by 7.17 points, or 0.2pc, at 4,753.92, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 42.31 points, or 0.3pc, to 15,006.18 at the opening bell.A measure of inflation favoured by the US Federal Reserve weakened by more than expected in November amid lower energy prices, government data showed, providing further reassurance to policymakers about a slowdown in price rises.The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 2.6pc from a year ago in November, markedly below October’s 2.9pc figure, the Department of Commerce said.Compared with a month ago, the index decreased 0.1pc, on the back of a slump in energy prices and lower food costs.With the volatile food and energy segments removed, “core” PCE inflation cooled to an annual rate of 3.2pc, down slightly from October as well.This adds to data indicating that inflation is coming down as the Fed holds interest rates steady at a 22-year high in a bid to firmly lower inflation back to its long-term 2pc target.With consumption and the jobs market remaining relatively resilient, hopes of a so-called “soft landing” - where inflation comes down without triggering a damaging recession - have risen.It’s beginning to looks a lot like rate cutsWith ever print of da-a-ta 🎶 pic.twitter.com/vC9UAeSjBU— Constance L Hunter (@ConstanceHunter) December 22, 2023The FTSE 100 has closed early for the Christmas holiday, with Britain’s blue-chip index ending the shorter day little changed at 7,697.51.The midcap FTSE 250 ended the day 0.1pc higher at 19,598.24 amid strong retail sales data for November, although gains were held back by data showing the UK economy is at risk of recession.Meanwhile, the pound has risen 0.3pc against the dollar to move well above $1.27.Brent crude in London has dipped to be flat on the day at just below $80 a barrel.US stock markets have dipped ahead of the opening bell as investors await a key inflation report.The personal consumption expenditure data - the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge - could test an eight-week long rally on Wall Street driven by optimism that the Federal Reserve could lower interest rates next year.Economists expect the price index to show a 2.8pc rise on an annual basis in November, softening from a 3pc increase the month before.Core prices, excluding volatile items like food and energy, are expected to have risen by 3.3pc last month, compared with 3.5pc growth in October.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq finished over 1pc higher on Thursday after data signaled third-quarter US economic growth was not as robust as originally stated, aiding hopes that the Fed could reduce borrowing costs next year.All three indexes are poised for their eighth-straight week in the green, with the S&P 500 set for its longest weekly winning streak since 2017, and the Nasdaq and the Dow since 2019.Meanwhile, Nike plunged 11.9pc before the bell after the sports-wear maker trimmed its annual sales forecast blaming cautious consumer spending, a weaker online business and more promotions, and said it plans to cut supplies of key product lines to manage costs.In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3pc, the S&P 500 was little changed and the Nasdaq 100 slipped by 0.1pc.Gas prices are little changed despite the ongoing attacks in the Red Sea on vessels heading through the vital trade route.European benchmark contracts remained around €34 per megawatt hour, while the UK equivalent was static at about 85p per therm.Prices had ticked higher after the attacks by Yemeni militants on transports through the Red Sea.However, contracts have slumped by about a quarter over the last month as European supplies hold up. A mild winter so far has subdued demand.Regulated rail fares in England will increase by up to 4.9pc from March 3 next year, the Department for Transport has said.July’s RPI measure of inflation, which is traditionally used to determine annual fare rises, was 9pc. The previous cap on increases in regulated fares was 5.9pc.Transport Secretary Mark Harper said:Having met our target of halving inflation across the economy, this is a significant intervention by the Government to cap the increase in rail fares below last year’s rise.Changed working patterns after the pandemic mean that our railways are still losing money and require significant subsidies, so this rise strikes a balance to keep our railways running, while not overburdening passengers.We remain committed to supporting the rail sector reform outdated working practices to help put it on a sustainable financial footing.Unilever has agreed to buy fast-growing premium haircare brand K18 as it continues to shake up its stable of brands.The deal, for an undisclosed sum, comes after Unilever sold off some of its weaker performing brands in recent months.Earlier this week, the consumer giant announced it will sell a group of more than 20 brands including Timotei shampoo and Impulse body spray to private equity firm Yellow Wood Partners.The company also sold off its Dollar Shave Club business in October.K18 meanwhile is a rapidly growing business specialising in hair masks and other products to address hair damage, with celebrity fans including Hailey Bieber and Selena Gomez.The brand, which was founded in 2020 by Suveen Sahib and Britta Cox, has been buoyed by surging popularity through social media, recording around 20 billion TikTok views.One of the Bank of England’s most hawkish policymakers has signalled he may be ready to shift his stance on interest rates if inflation continues to cool.Prof Jonathan Haskel, one of a minority of Monetary Policy Committee members who pushed for rate hikes at recent meetings, tweeted that there was “news” in the latest inflation report, which showed the consumer prices index eased from 4.6pc to 3.9pc in November.The Imperial College Business School professor said that the fall in services inflation, which strips out volatile factors like air fares, seemed more “broadly based” than in previous months.However, he insisted that he would not shift his stance “based on one month data”.Personal view of the Nov CPI release and commentary: 1/31.

All are common incentive mechanisms in online games.The new rules, which will effectively set spending limits for online games, sparked panic among investors.Steven Leung, executive director of institutional sales at broker UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong, said:It’s not necessarily the regulation itself - it’s the policy risk that’s too high.People had thought this kind of risk should have been over and had started to look at fundamentals again. It hurts confidence a lot.Christmas getaway disruption is continuing with long queues for cross-Channel journeys, motorway closures and train cancellations.The Port of Dover in Kent said it is taking about 90 minutes to process cars with pre-booked tickets.It attributed the delay to a surge in demand for ferries after the Channel Tunnel rail link was closed on Thursday due to unscheduled industrial action by French workers, which ruined the travel plans of tens of thousands of people.Eurostar, which operates passenger services to and from London St Pancras, said it will operate two extra services per day between London and Paris up to and including Christmas Eve to help people whose trains were cancelled on Thursday.Vehicle-carrying train service Eurotunnel said it is running its usual timetable but is only accepting customers who have pre-booked.The M20 motorway in Kent remains closed in the coastbound direction between junctions 8 and 9 due to Operation Brock, which involves organising a queue for freight traffic during disruption to cross-Channel services.National Highways said this is causing 45-minute delays.London Underground workers will stage a series of strikes in the new year in a dispute over pay.Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) have voted overwhelmingly to take industrial action over a 5pc pay offer.Engineering and maintenance workers will be taking action over January 5 and 6, with no rest-day working or overtime until January 12.London Underground control centre and power/control members will be taking action over January 7 and 8, and fleet workers will walk out on January 8.Signallers and service controller members will take action on January 9 and 12 while all fleet, stations and trains grades will walk out on January 10.RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said Tube workers who help bring “vast amounts of value” to the London economy were not going to put up with senior managers and commissioners “raking it in”, while they were given “modest below-inflation offers”.JD Sports shares slumped as much as 6.9pc in early trading to the bottom of the FTSE 100 after Nike revealed it is seeking to make cost savings of as much as $2bn (£1.6bn).The US sports giant published a weak sales outlook after the closing bell on Wall Street, sending its shares down 12pc in after-hours trading, with revenues expected to be down in the third quarter of its financial year and up in the low single digits in the fourth quarter.Nike is seen as a bellwether for the sports fashion industry, with its weak performance hitting shares of retailers around the world.Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group, which owns Sports Direct, has fallen 0.9pc while Primark owner Associated British Foods has dropped 0.8pc.Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor said:Nike has struggled amid the weak consumer backdrop, heavy promotions and discounts, sluggish online sales and a slowdown in demand from the world’s second largest economy China.Sports retailers have been more cautious in terms of their stock purchases too, weighing on Nike’s wholesale business.While the US economy has thus far proven to be more resilient than expected, there are concerns about a slowdown coming through in 2024 which could hurt Nike.UK stocks slipped in early trading after a dour GDP reading left Britain teetering on the edge of recession.The blue-chip FTSE 100 and the domestically-focused FTSE 250 both edged down 0.1pc.Retailers were among the biggest fallers, declining as much as 1.5pc despite data showing shop sales rose by more than expected in November, as some commentators questioned whether the impact of Black Friday is waning.Life insurers were amongst top decliners, falling as much as 0.9pc.The FTSE 100 is eyeing a fourth straight weekly gain, while the FTSE 250 is set to rise for a third consecutive week.Global markets have rallied amid hopes that the US Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates early next year, while a surprise drop in inflation this week boosted UK equities.UK markets will close early at 12.30pm as traders head home for the Christmas holidays.Revolut has swung to a loss of £25.4m despite higher interest rates, as it faces a renewed battle over its attempts to secure a UK banking licence.Our senior technology reporter Matthew Field has the latest:The £24bn financial technology company recorded the pre-tax loss in 2022, falling from a profit of £39.8m a year earlier, while it recorded an increase in revenues of 45pc - to £922.5m.The numbers in its long-delayed accounts came after Revolut was forced to redesign its financial IT systems after its auditors issued a warning over its last set of accounts.The financial technology company was heavily scrutinised in March after its auditors, BDO, raised warnings over almost £477m of revenues in its accounts.For 2022, BDO said the “matter has been resolved” and it was satisfied it had seen “sufficient appropriate audit evidence” to verify Revolut’s 2022 numbers.Residential property prices in Germany continued their fall, dropping 10.2pc in the third quarter from a year earlier, a further grim sign for the nation’s real-estate sector, official data showed.Germany’s statistics office said the decline was the biggest since it began keeping records in the year 2000.The FTSE 100 fell at the opening bell as revised official data showed Britain could be falling into a recession.The UK’s blue chip index was down 0.5pc to 7,681.32 while the midcap FTSE 250 was down 0.1pc to 19,553.70.Markets are open for a shorter period today ahead of the Christmas holidays.The Prime Minister has “failed to grow the economy”, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said.Responding to the latest GDP figures, Labour MP Ms Reeves said:Rishi Sunak is a Prime Minister whose legacy is one of failure. He failed to beat Liz Truss, he failed to cut waiting lists, he failed to stop the boats and now he has failed to grow the economy.Thirteen years of economic failure under the Conservatives have left working people worse off with higher bills, higher mortgages and higher prices in the shops.It’s time for change. The Labour Party, led by Keir Starmer, has a long-term plan to grow the economy and make working people better off.The fall in GDP in the third quarter indicates that Britain may already be in the “mildest of mild recessions”, according to economists.Ashley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics, said:Whether or not there is a small recession, the big picture is that we expect real GDP growth to remain subdued throughout 2024.The breakdown of Q3 GDP showed that the drag from higher interest rates is starting to hit households harder.The 0.5pc quarter on quarter fall in consumer spending (revised down from 0.4pc q/q previously) was the first fall since Q4 2022.But the 0.4pc q/q rise in real household disposable income helped the saving rate rise from 9.5pc in Q2 to 10.1pc in Q3.With the full effects of higher interest rates yet to feed through to the economy, we think consumer spending will fall further in Q4 2023 and Q1 2024.Overall, today’s release suggests the economy was a bit weaker than we previously thought in Q3 and the mildest of mild recession may have begun. Looking ahead, the latest activity surveys point to weak GDP growth in Q4 too.After the UK’s economic performance was revised down for the second and third quarters, Quilter Cheviot’s head of fixed interest research Richard Carter, said:ONS data this morning reveals UK GDP fell by a surprise 0.1pc in Q3 compared to the previous quarter, revised down from a first estimate of no growth, highlighting just how much of a strain there currently is on the UK economy.Q2 was also revised down and is now estimated to have shown no growth compared to the 0.2pc increase previously estimated, meaning the UK has barely scraped by without a recession in 2023.Growth is weakening and interest rates are really beginning to bite and while a recession has just been avoided to date, there is no guarantee one will be avoided in 2024.You just have to look at October’s -0.3pc reading to see that growth is trending further in the wrong direction.Inflation has eased more than anticipated and interest rate predictions are suggesting more easing than originally thought in 2024, but the damage may already have been done. Certainly, Rishi Sunak’s pledge to grow the economy is now severely in doubt.This is going to ratchet the pressure up on the Bank of England to cut interest rates. The government would certainly like this given 2024 is likely to be an election year, but ultimately the Bank of England will stick to the narrative of the job is not yet done on inflation and it is too early to be talking about rate cuts.Black Friday is no longer giving the same boost to retailers, meaning the latest increase in retail sales figures should be viewed with caution, according to Lisa Hooker of PwC. She said:At a headline level, retail sales increased in November compared with October’s disappointing performance, with sales volumes - excluding petrol - up 1.3pc on the previous month, and they were also up 0.3pc vs the previous year.Almost all of the increase was due the early start to Black Friday which we identified in our online promotions tracker, as well as the more seasonal wetter and colder weather at the start of the month, encouraging more shoppers to spend earlier in the month.However, a note of caution interpreting November’s results as they did not include the whole Black Friday weekend.The longer term trend suggests that Black Friday is no longer giving the same boost to retailers as previously, with the non-seasonally adjusted sales peak falling every year since 2019. This echoes the findings of our own survey which showed a quarter fewer consumers interested in Black Friday overall.Indeed, non-food volumes remained 2.7pc below pre-pandemic levels, in spite of the apparent improvement last month.This means that, in spite of the headline improvement in sales last month, Christmas is still likely to come down to the wire for retailers. Consumers said they would spend less overall, but can they be persuaded to spend more than they planned in the final weekend before the big day itself? And, if not, the likelihood of bumper Boxing Day sales to clear seasonal stock will only increase.Regardless, the Golden Quarter will have been a disappointment for many retailers, and they will be hoping that the improving macroeconomic backdrop of lower inflation and increasing real wages will improve their outlook in the new year.Retail sales grew stronger than expected last month as shoppers snapped up Black Friday bargains and bought Christmas presents, according to official figures.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed that retail sales volumes increased by 1.3pc in November.It was ahead of the predictions of economists, who had forecast 0.4pc growth for the month.The ONS also revised its data for October upwards, reporting that there was zero growth in retail sales after previous estimating a fall of 0.3pc.Retail sales increased 1.3% in November 2023, from no growth in October.When we look more broadly, sales fell 0.8% in the three months to November when compared with the previous three months.➡️ https://t.co/o5Sbq4Djgm pic.twitter.com/ShLqgV9VV6— Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) December 22, 2023ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said:The latest data from both our regular monthly business survey and VAT returns show the economy performed slightly less well in the last two quarters than our initial estimates.The broader picture, though, remains one of an economy that has been little changed over the last year.The latest VAT data, which takes a little time to receive and process means we now estimate the economy showed no growth in the second quarter, with weaker performances from smaller businesses, particularly those in both hospitality and IT than first shown.We also now estimate the economy contracted slightly in the third quarter, when we previously reported no growth, with later returns from our business survey showing film production, engineering & design and telecommunications all performing a little worse than we initially thought.After the downward revisions for the economy, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said:The medium-term outlook for the UK economy is far more optimistic than these numbers suggest.We’ve seen inflation fall again this week, and the OBR expects the measures in the Autumn Statement, including the largest business tax cut in modern British history and tax cuts for 29 million working people, will deliver the largest boost to potential growth on record.The UK is teetering on the edge of a recession, official figures show, after initial estimates on the performance of the economy were revised down.Gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.1pc in the three months to September, according to the Office for National Statistics.Initial estimates had indicated the economy flatlined in the third quarter, and the subsequent estimates that the economy shrank by 0.3pc in October means the fourth quarter could also show a contraction.Two consecutive quarters of economic contraction are the definition of a technical recession.Britain’s economy is also estimated to have shown no growth in the second quarter of the year, revised down from a previously estimated increase of 0.2pc.The data will increase pressure on the Bank of England to cut interest rates early next year to avoid a deeper economic downturn.Separate figures showed this week that inflation fell to 3.9pc in November as households battled with 15-year high interest rates of 5.25pc.GDP is estimated to have fallen by 0.1% in Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2023, revised down from the previous estimate of no growth.Meanwhile GDP is now estimated to have shown no growth in Q2, revised down from the previous estimate of +0.2% growth.➡️ https://t.co/KjTIdncntf pic.twitter.com/xb7H0dRZKD— Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) December 22, 2023Thanks for joining me.

The company has significantly profited from increased demand for graphics processing units (GPUs), which are crucial for training AI models.Nvidia's business exploded this year. However, it is worth looking at companies at slightly earlier stages in their AI journeys, as they could have more room to run in the coming years.Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is an exciting option, with years of experience in the chip market. The company also plans to launch a new AI GPU in 2024.So, forget Nvidia. Here is why Intel is a magnificent AI stock to buy instead.It hasn't been easy to be an investor in Intel over the last few years. The company was responsible for more than 80% of the central processing unit (CPU) market for at least a decade, and was the primary chip supplier for Apple's MacBook lineup for years. However, Intel's dominance saw it grow complacent, leaving it vulnerable to more innovative competitors.As a result, Advanced Micro Devices started gradually eating away at Intel's CPU market share in 2017, with Intel's share now down to 69%. Then, in 2020, Apple cut ties with Intel in favor of far more powerful in-house hardware. Intel's stock subsequently dipped 4% over the last three years. Meanwhile, annual revenue tumbled 19%, with operating income down 90%.However, the fall from grace has seemingly lit a fire under Intel again. According to Mercury Research, from the second quarter of 2022 to Q2 2023, Intel regained 3% of its CPU market share from AMD.Moreover, Intel has pivoted its business to the $137 billion AI market, with plans to challenge Nvidia's dominance in 2024. The sector is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030, which would see it rise more than $1 trillion before the end of the decade.As a result, even if Intel can't dethrone Nvidia, projections show there will be plenty of opportunities for Intel to snap up market share and profit significantly from the industry's development.Earlier this month, Intel unveiled Gaudi3, a generative AI chip meant to compete directly with Nvidia's H100. The GPU will begin shipping in 2024 alongside Core Ultra and Xeon chips that include neural processing units, making them capable of running AI programs faster.Shares in Intel have soared more than 70% in 2023, almost entirely thanks to its prospects in AI. While that is nowhere near Nvidia's stock growth in the period, it could mean Intel has more to offer new investors in the coming years.The charts show Intel's earnings could hit nearly $3 per share over the next two fiscal years, while Nvidia's are expected to reach $24 per share. Therefore, on the surface, Nvidia might look like a no-brainer. However, multiplying these figures by the companies' forward price-to-earnings ratios yields a stock price of $130 for Intel and $939 for Nvidia.Looking at their current positions, the figures project Intel's stock will rise 184% and Nvidia's 95% within the next two fiscal years. While both boast impressive growth, Intel is forecast to deliver far more significant gains.The figures align with Nvidia's meteoric rise this year compared to Intel's more gradual expansion. Intel is just getting started in AI and could be in for a lucrative 2024. So if you're looking for an AI stock to add before the new year, Intel is a screaming buy right now instead of Nvidia.Should you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?Before you buy stock in Intel, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Intel wasn't one of them.

If you have $1 million, you likely want to know how much your monthly payout will be. Monthly cash flow from a $1 million annuity varies depending on several factors, including the type of annuity purchased, the age at which the annuity payments begin and current interest rates.Don't Miss:The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare?Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you.The monthly payments from a $1 million annuity can range significantly. For people who start their annuity payments later in life, say between the ages of 60 and 70, the monthly disbursements can be higher because of the shorter payment period expected. According to SmartAsset, they might expect to receive between $4,500 and $6,500 per month for the rest of their lives or the specified duration of the annuity contract. This window gives a broad idea but emphasizes the need for personalized quotes to understand exact figures.Annuities are popular for providing a sense of security through guaranteed income, which is particularly appealing for those concerned about preserving their lifestyle post-retirement and the risk of outliving their savings. A well-chosen annuity can become the cornerstone of a secure retirement plan, but it must be tailored to individual financial situations and goals. For an accurate estimation tailored to your circumstances, using an income annuity calculator or consulting with a financial adviser would be the best course of action.Annuities can provide a steady stream of income in retirement, with payout structures influenced by multiple factors.Annuities come in several forms, each tailored to different financial goals and risk tolerance levels. Immediate annuities start payouts shortly after a lump sum investment, while deferred annuities allow assets to grow before income begins. You can choose between fixed annuities, offering guaranteed payouts, and variable annuities, where payments depend on investment performance. Indexed annuities are another option, with payouts linked to a specific market index’s performance.The method by which annuities pay out can greatly affect their suitability for a retiree’s needs. You can opt for life annuities to receive payments for as long as you live, or you can select term-certain annuities for guaranteed income over a set period. Joint and survivor annuities also are available, ensuring that spouses or other beneficiaries continue to receive payments after the original annuitant’s death.Myriad factors impact the monthly income from an annuity. Your age at purchase is critical; the younger you are when you buy an annuity, the smaller the monthly payments tend to be because they’re spread over a longer expected lifetime. Interest rates also play a significant role — higher rates typically lead to more substantial monthly payments. Initial investment amount, chosen riders or additional contract features, and the insuring company’s financial strength further dictate the payment amounts.When considering a $1 million annuity, you must understand the factors that influence monthly payments, such as whether the annuity is immediate or deferred, current interest rates and your life expectancy.Immediate annuities start payments almost immediately after the initial investment. If you invest in an immediate annuity, you can expect to receive a fixed monthly payment based on agreed-upon terms. Deferred annuities, on the other hand, involve payments starting at a future date. This delay allows the investment to grow over time before payouts begin, often resulting in a higher monthly payment.The monthly income from an annuity is significantly affected by the interest rates at the time of purchase. A higher interest rate can increase monthly payments as the investment accrues more interest. Annuity calculators can help estimate monthly payments by factoring in these rates.Insurers use life expectancy as a key determinant in calculating annuity payments. The longer a person is expected to live, the more the $1 million must be spread out, potentially reducing the size of each payment. Conversely, a shorter life expectancy might result in larger monthly payments. This calculation ensures the full value of the annuity is paid out over the person's lifetime.Annuities can have complex tax implications. Withdrawals from a nonqualified annuity are typically taxed as ordinary income, and you may also face penalties if you take them before age 59½. Conversely, funds from a qualified annuity may be taxed differently because they are often purchased with pretax dollars.Careful planning is crucial to maximize annuity payouts. Immediate annuities generally offer a higher monthly payment because they begin disbursing funds soon after investment. On the other hand, deferred annuities can be beneficial for people who can afford to wait, as they accrue interest over time, potentially increasing the monthly disbursement amount.If you have excess cash from your annuity payments, reinvesting can yield additional growth. You might consider low-risk investments such as bonds or fixed deposits or potentially higher-yield — yet riskier — options like stocks or mutual funds. This strategy should align with your overall long-term financial goals and risk tolerance.\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?APPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis ReportTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis ReportThis article How Much Cash Will A $1 Million Annuity Bring In Each Month? originally appeared on Benzinga.com© 2023 Benzinga.com.

It built a small test track near Las Vegas to develop its transportation technology, and for a time took the name Virgin Hyperloop One after Richard Branson’s Virgin invested. Virgin removed its branding after the startup decided last year to focus on cargo rather than people.Now, the company has laid off most of its employees, and is trying to sell its remaining assets, including the test track and machinery, according to one of the people, who asked to remain anonymous discussing private information. In early 2022, the company employed more than 200 people. The business has also closed its Los Angeles office. The remaining workers, tasked with overseeing the asset sale, were told their employment will end on Dec. 31.DP World, the Dubai-based conglomerate, has backed Hyperloop One since 2016 and owns a majority stake. The startup’s remaining intellectual property will be transferred to DP World, a person familiar with the situation said.Through a spokesman, DP World declined to comment. Raja Narayanan, Hyperloop One’s acting chief executive officer, also didn’t respond to requests for comment.Hyperloop One, formally known as Hyperloop Technologies, merged with a shell company this April, according to a document reviewed by Bloomberg. At that time, the value of shares in most classes was written down to zero cents, and the shareholders of the shell company became the only owners of Hyperloop One. At an all-hands meeting, employees were told that DP World orchestrated the transaction, according to one of the people.The company had captured the public’s imagination since its founding in 2014, a year after Elon Musk released a white paper outlining a vision for hyperloop technology. The concept was a tantalizing promise of a new kind of transportation technology — and an end to traffic.But the nascent industry stumbled, and Hyperloop One never won a contract to build a working hyperloop. The company also attracted plenty of attention for the wrong reasons. Co-founder Brogan BamBrogan once arrived at work to find a noose on his chair. And another co-founder, the venture capitalist Shervin Pishevar, stepped aside after Bloomberg reported on sexual harassment allegations against him, which he denied. A one-time director, Ziyavudin Magomedov, was arrested in Moscow on charges of fraud and embezzlement unrelated to Hyperloop One. At the time, Magomedov’s lawyer said he was appealing the arrest.Although no large-scale hyperloop has been built after years of effort, the concept continues to enchant entrepreneurs. Several hyperloop companies are at various stages of building protoypes, including Hardt Hyperloop, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies Inc. and Swisspod Technologies.Musk has promoted the field as well, creating a series of competitions for student-designed hyperloops and building a now-demolished test track. He also started Boring Co., a tunneling business that has pursued related technology.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekOne Man’s Longevity Obsession Now Includes Fountain-of-Youth InjectionsWhat Dermatologists Really Think About Those Anti-Aging ProductsThe Most Secretive Longevity Lab Finally Opens Its DoorsWhat the Oldest Lab Rodents Are Teaching Humans About Staying YoungMichael J.

Of course, he'd argue that he's actually a business picker instead of a stock picker. The businesses he picks, though, tend to translate to good stocks.The legendary investor doesn't just pick individual stocks -- he also likes some exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Buffett really likes one ETF, in particular. But there's an ETF that's just as good and could help you retire as a millionaire.There are only two ETFs in Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio: the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT: SPY) and the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO). Both are index ETFs that track the S&P 500.Which of these two funds is Buffett's favorite? I think the evidence points to the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF.For one thing, Berkshire owns a little more of the Vanguard ETF than it does of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. At the end of the third quarter, the conglomerate's stake in VOO was worth slightly more than $17.5 billion, while its position in SPY was worth under $17.5 million.Also, Buffett seemed to express his opinion in his 2013 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. In that letter, he wrote that he had instructed in his will that most of the fortune inherited by his family be invested in a low-cost S&P 500 index fund. He added, \"I suggest Vanguard's.\"Why would Buffett prefer the Vanguard fund to another that owned the same stocks? Cost. Vanguard is well known for its low annual expense fees. In that 2013 letter, he emphasized that it's important to \"keep your costs minimal.\"VOO certainly beats SPY on this front. The Vanguard fund's annual expense ratio is only 0.03%, compared to 0.0945% for the SPDR ETF.However, when it comes to cost, there's another alternative that's just as good as VOO. BlackRock's iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: IVV) also tracks the S&P 500. Its expense ratio is also 0.03%.There are only two meaningful differentiators between these two ETFs. One is average trading volume. The average volume for VOO is around 4.8 million shares, while the average volume for IVV is slightly under 5 million shares.The other is assets under management (AUM). VOO's AUM is around $937 billion, compared to IVV's AUM of nearly $397 billion. Neither of these differences should matter to long-term investors, though.Buffett told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders roughly a decade ago that any investor who owns a large, diversified basket of stocks via an S&P index fund is \"bound to do well\" over time. He was right.It's possible to retire as a millionaire by investing in VOO or IVV. For example, let's assume that you invest $5,350 per year in either ETF for 30 years. If the S&P 500 delivers the same average annual return of 10.7% as it has over the last 30 years, you'd end the period with a little over $1 million.The low expense ratio for VOO and IVV wouldn't matter materially to your total returns. Taxes could be a factor, though. However, investing in a tax-protected account, such as an IRA or a 401(k), would solve that problem.Of course, there's no guarantee that the S&P 500 will deliver the same level of returns going forward as it has in the past. Still, investing regularly in VOO or IVV over a long period is likely to pay off nicely.Should you invest $1,000 in iShares Trust-iShares Core S&P 500 ETF right now?Before you buy stock in iShares Trust-iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and iShares Trust-iShares Core S&P 500 ETF wasn't one of them.

Buyers are shunning them due to a lack of subsidies, a desire to wait for better technology and continued shortfalls in charging infrastructures. A fierce price war sparked by Tesla Inc. and competitive Chinese models are further depressing values of new and used cars alike, threatening earnings at rivals like Volkswagen AG and Stellantis NV.Because most new vehicles in Europe are sold via leases, automakers and dealers who finance these transactions are trying to recover losses from plummeting valuations by raising borrowing costs. That’s hitting demand in some European markets that were in the vanguard of the shift away from fossil fuel-powered propulsion. Some of the biggest buyers of new cars, including rental firms, are cutting back on EV adoption because they’re losing money on resales, with Sixt SE dropping Tesla models from its fleet.“When a car loses 1% of its worth, I make 1% less profit,” said Christian Dahlheim, who heads VW’s financial services arm. The issues with secondhand EVs, he said, have the potential to destroy billions of euros in earnings for the broader industry.The problems are expected to intensify next year, when many of the 1.2 million EVs sold in Europe in 2021 will come off their three-year leasing contracts and enter the secondhand market. How companies tackle this problem will be key for their bottom lines, consumer confidence and ultimately decarbonization — including the European Union’s plan to phase out sales of new fuel-burning cars by 2035.“There isn’t used-car demand for EVs,” said Matt Harrison, Toyota Motor Corp.’s chief operating officer in Europe. “That’s really hurting the cost-of-ownership story.”Companies can funnel battery-powered cars into mobility offerings and ride-sharing startups, but there’s limited demand from these businesses. Unwanted combustion cars often end up in Africa, where their poor state causes pollution issues. That market is largely shut to EVs because it has no viable infrastructure to charge them.China offers a cautionary tale. Lucrative subsidies turned the country into an EV giant, but also produced weed-infested graveyards of abandoned battery-powered vehicles. Any similar eyesores in Europe or the US may strengthen calls from conservative politicians to roll back aid for the industry, with key elections coming up in the US and Europe in 2024.Read more: China’s EV Graveyards Show Dark Side of Frenetic DevelopmentWarning signs around EVs appeared early this year when Tesla started aggressively cutting prices in an effort to prop up sales. That sparked a price war as other manufacturers followed, eating into profitability for some and pushing up already steep losses for others.Prices for secondhand EVs slumped by around a third in the year through October, compared with a decline of just 5% in the overall used market, according to sales data from iSeeCars.com, a website that ranks cars and dealers. Used EVs take longer to sell than gasoline models even after significant price cuts, the group said.In Germany, Europe’s biggest auto market, most new vehicles are first sold as company or fleet cars and then re-enter the private secondhand market one to three years later. But with orders even for new EVs slowing, more and more used models are sitting on lots longer than 90 days, meaning they’ve become “risk inventory,” according to the Deutsche Automobil Treuhand market researcher.“One has to slash prices significantly just to get customers to look at EVs,” said Dirk Weddigen von Knapp, who heads a group representing VW and Audi dealers.Part of the problem is that the industry is handling secondhand EVs for the first time. While combustion-engine cars can be quickly valued via their age and mileage, there are no tests in widespread use that determine the quality of a battery, Weddigen von Knapp said. The battery represents around 30% of an EV’s value, a share that is expected to decline in the coming years, according to BloombergNEF.To be sure, some EVs are performing well years after their introduction, with less-than-expected battery degradation, said Mike Tyndall, an analyst at HSBC. Teslas can sell quickly in the secondhand market because of the brand’s reputation as a technology leader and its regular wireless software updates. The quirky i3 electric car BMW AG introduced a decade ago has even developed a cult following.Still, most consumers remain reticent buying used EVs. Manufacturers are already working on new battery technologies including solid-state that promise cheaper cars with longer ranges and faster charging. The likes of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and BMW have announced plans to introduce several next-generation EVs around mid-decade, while Volkswagen, Stellantis and Renault are developing models costing €25,000 or less.Read more: VW Shows €25,000 EV to Compete Where Tesla Has Left an OpeningAyvens, a fleet management company handling around 3.5 million vehicles, said the uncertainty around EV technology will convince more customers to lease rather than buy — accelerating a shift away from owning a car to driving it for a fee.“EVs are a booster of the transition of ownership to usership,” said Annie Pin, Ayvens’ chief commercial officer.--With assistance from Craig Trudell.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekOne Man’s Longevity Obsession Now Includes Fountain-of-Youth InjectionsWhat Dermatologists Really Think About Those Anti-Aging ProductsThe Most Secretive Longevity Lab Finally Opens Its DoorsWhat the Oldest Lab Rodents Are Teaching Humans About Staying YoungMichael J.

The bubble has burst.”For years, the property sector in Germany and elsewhere in Europe boomed as interest rates were low and demand strong.But a sharp rise in rates and costs has put an end to the run, tipping developers into insolvency as bank financing dries up and deals freeze.It comes as official data showed Germany is the worst performing G7 economy since the pandemic, growing by just 0.3pc.Britain slipped back behind France to be the next worst performer after downward revisions to growth left the UK on the brink of recession.Read the latest updates below.Thanks for joining Chris, me and our team of contributing reporters this year on the Markets live blog.Christmas cake beckons, so we’ll be back in the New Year blogging breaking business news. We really appreciate your views in the vibrant comment section and look forward to writing for you in 2024.In the meantime, I’ll leave you with some of the latest headlines from The Telegraph’s wider Business section:Nike to axe jobs in $2bn cost-cutting driveHyperloop project formerly backed by Richard Branson shuts downGeorge Osborne shares in £32m payout at investment firm Robey WarshawElon Musk’s Tesla has signed a deal today to acquire land for a new factory in Shanghai, after the world’s second-largest economy struggles experienced a 10pc drop in foreign investment in the first 11 months of the year.Construction of the factory is expected to start early next year with production to come on line by the end of the year, the Xinhua News Agency said.The factory will not build batteries for cars but for energy companies companies to store power. These are increasingly important with the growth in solar power and wind energy, which only generate electricity when weather conditions are favorable and need to store it for when residential and commercial users need it.The Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer backed by Warren Buffett is to build a car factory in Hungary, the company has said, as it plans to ram up its market share in Europe.With the new factory, the rival of Tesla “hopes to accelerate the entry of new energy passenger vehicles into the European market, further deepen (the firm’s) global layout, and actively promote the green transformation of the global energy structure”, it said on Chinese social media, according to AFP.Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway originally bought into BYD stake in 2008, but has been selling down his stake from a reported 21pc in late 2021 to under 8pc by the end of November.Mr Buffett told CNBC in April that he had been selling shares in BYD because of the valuation of his stake had become around $6.5bn, saying “I think it’s an extraordinary company ... we haven’t sold all our BYD by a long shot. We are not in a hurry to sell it.”Retailers are hoping for a “last minute dash” from shoppers after some disappointing sales figures in recent months.It comes after gloomy data was released by the CBI suggesting that retailers have endured eight consecutive months of year-on-year sales going down.But the latest data from the ONS suggests that November might actually have seen some green shoots.Darren Morgan, of the ONS, said:Retail sales grew strongly in November as heavy Black Friday discounting encouraged shoppers to spend. However, with the three-month trend continuing to fall and overall sales still below pre-pandemic levels, it’s still a challenging time for retailers.The trade body representing major retailers nonetheless struck an upbeat note. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said:Many retailers tried to give sales a needed boost in November by starting their Black Friday sales even earlier this year. Cosmetics and toiletries had another strong month as consumers continued to splurge on smaller indulgences.Retailers anticipate that consumers will be making a last-minute dash to their favourite stores in the final days leading up to Christmas.The FTSE 100 was up 2.78pc today. Lloyds Banking Group was the biggest riser, up 1.81pc, followed by investment fund Pershing Square, up 1.73pc. The biggest faller was JD Sports, down 5.15pc, followed by Ocado, down 4.25pc.Meanwhile, the FTSE 250 rose 0.31pc, with PureTech Health leading the pack, up 20.95pc, followed by Harbour Energy, up 5.82pc. Industrial refractory business RHI Magnesita fell 4.55pc, followed by industrial thread company Coats Group, down 3.68pc.Lionsgate will spin off its studio unit - famous for the John Wick and Hunger Games films - into a a so-called “blank cheque” company listed on Nasdaq.The studio business is to be marged into Screaming Eagle Acquisition Corp, a special purpose-acquisition company (Spac) to create a listed company representing Lionsgate’s television and film assets that include a vast back catalogue.The existing Lionsgate, officially known as the Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation, is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and will retail its pay-for cable and satellite channels, according to reports.Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation will gain £350m from the split and retain 87.3pc of the Spac, which is expected to be renamed Lionsgate Studios.Pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb will acquire drugmaker Karuna Therapeutics for $14bn (£11bn), the two American companies announced this afternoon.Bristol will gain Karuna’s experimental drug KarXT, which has the potential to be a game changing medicine to treat schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease and bipolar disorder.Bristol chief Christopher Boerner said: “We expect KarXT to enhance our growth through the late 2020s and into the next decade.”KarXT could hit the market for schizophrenia treatment as soon as September, depending on regulatory approvals.Meanwhile, clinical trials for Alzheimer’s treatment are underway, with data expected by 2026.An advert for North Sea oil giant Equinor has been banned by regulators over “misleading” environmental claims. Our reporter James Warrington has the details:The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) censured Equinor over an ad that suggested wind and carbon capture played a balanced role in the company’s energy output when oil and gas still make up the vast majority of its business.The ruling applied to an advert in The Economist in June, which said that “wind, oil, gas, carbon capture and new jobs” were “all part of the broader energy picture”.In September, Equinor secured approval to develop Britain’s largest untapped oil field in the North Sea, sparking fury from environmental activists.In response to the ruling, the state-owned Norwegian company said the advert was aimed at politicians, advisers and journalists, rather than the general public.The company added that the words “oil” and “gas” featured prominently in the advert and that text at the bottom said that it was “producing the oil and gas the UK needs now”.The advert also featured a picture of a worker on an oil rig.But in its ruling, the ASA argued that the ad would be seen by consumer and business readers, as well as decision-makers.It said the ads were “likely to mislead” after omitting “significant information”.A spokesman for Equinor said: “We respect, but are disappointed by, the ruling of the Advertising Standards Authority Council. We will take note of it for future campaigns.”The dollar fell on Friday, hitting a nearly five-month low against a range of other countries after data showed annual American inflation slowed further in November. This had the effect of cementing market expectations for a US interest rate cut next March.Inflation in the US was just 2pc in the third quarter of 2023 according to new figures.In the 12 months to November, inflation stood at 2.6pc, down from 2.9pc in October.Stuart Cole, chief macro economist at Equiti Capital, explained:The market will view the data as very much adding weight to the Fed’s recent tilt towards an easier monetary stance.This is the Fed’s preferred measure of inflationary pressures, so if you take into account the fact that some of the effect of the tightening delivered to date is still to be felt, then I think the FOMC may well be starting to privately feel that it’s job done as regards getting inflation back under control.BE Offices, which provides “all-inclusive, inspirational office space solutions” across London and in Birmingham, Belfast and Southampton, has gone into administration, according to a report.It has previously been in a voluntary arrangement with creditors.The company was not answering its main telephone line this afternoon.It follows the collapse of WeWork, which entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States, after its model of taking out long-term leases and selling on fashionable space with office buildings on a short-term basis came unstuck.Sales of new American homes cooled more than anticipated in November, slipping to the lowest level in a year, according to official data that lends further support to the growing consensus that the Fed will soon start cutting interest.The market for new properties has been boosted in recent months by a lack of existing homes, as high mortgage rates dissuaded homeowners - who previously locked in lower rates - from putting their houses up for sale.Last month, sales of new single-family houses came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 590,000, around 12 percent below October’s figure, the US Commerce Department said. This was slightly above November 2022’s pace of 582,000, however.While the latest weakness appears to reflect elevated mortgage rates earlier in the year, rates have since come down.If you’re worried about growth in the FTSE 100, spare a thought for what’s happening in China.The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index, which tracks listed companies based in China but with shares traded in the US, is down more than 11pc in 2023. This has occurred in a year where the Nasdaq Composite index (heavily skewed towards American technology firms) is up 45pc.Today that Chinese index has dropped 2.4pc, prompting Rajeev De Mello, a fund manager at the Geneva-based GAMA Asset Management, to tell Bloomberg: “In a way it is a fitting end for a year that has severely disappointed China bulls. The performance gap between US and China equities is staggering.”I’m heading off for the festive holidays so I’ll take this opportunity to wish you a very happy Christmas.Fear not, though, as Alex Singleton will be doing his best Santa impression as he delivers you little presents of news as they arise.Speaking of which, I need to grab a few last gifts before the big day, much like these shoppers bustling around Covent Garden in London today:A staff revolt is looming at The Guardian over the newspaper’s return to the office amid concerns the new policy will give some workers less time to spend with their pets.Our reporter James Warrington has the details:Bosses have told staff they must come into the office for a minimum of three days a week from January after many failed to return following the pandemic.But the mandate has been met with anger by the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), which has asked members for their views on the issue.In a survey distributed earlier this month, Guardian staff were asked how much they agreed with various statements about the impact of returning to the office.These ranged from concerns about the financial impact of commuting, to issues around work-life balance and distractions in the office.Read how the Guardian has been plunged into in-fighting over the policy.Swedish regulators are investigating alleged suspension failures in Tesla cars in a probe similar to that of neighbouring Norway’s traffic safety regulator.The country’s Transport Agency told Reuters “that investigative work is also underway with us”.A spokesperson for the Swedish regulator declined to comment on details of the probe as it was still ongoing.The Norwegian Public Roads Administration (NPRA) on Thursday said it started questioning Tesla in September 2022 and asked the carmaker to assess consumer complaints about lower rear control arms breaking on its Model S and X vehicles.The Norwegian agency could recommend that Tesla recall the vehicles to replace the parts if it determines they pose a “serious risk.”However, it could also close the review if there is no safety issue or decide to extend the investigation.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq opened higher after a key US inflation reading came in softer than expected, boosting recent investor optimism that the Federal Reserve could lower borrowing costs next year.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 55.08 points, or 0.2pc, at the open to 37,349.27.The S&P 500 opened higher by 7.17 points, or 0.2pc, at 4,753.92, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 42.31 points, or 0.3pc, to 15,006.18 at the opening bell.A measure of inflation favoured by the US Federal Reserve weakened by more than expected in November amid lower energy prices, government data showed, providing further reassurance to policymakers about a slowdown in price rises.The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 2.6pc from a year ago in November, markedly below October’s 2.9pc figure, the Department of Commerce said.Compared with a month ago, the index decreased 0.1pc, on the back of a slump in energy prices and lower food costs.With the volatile food and energy segments removed, “core” PCE inflation cooled to an annual rate of 3.2pc, down slightly from October as well.This adds to data indicating that inflation is coming down as the Fed holds interest rates steady at a 22-year high in a bid to firmly lower inflation back to its long-term 2pc target.With consumption and the jobs market remaining relatively resilient, hopes of a so-called “soft landing” - where inflation comes down without triggering a damaging recession - have risen.It’s beginning to looks a lot like rate cutsWith ever print of da-a-ta 🎶 pic.twitter.com/vC9UAeSjBU— Constance L Hunter (@ConstanceHunter) December 22, 2023The FTSE 100 has closed early for the Christmas holiday, with Britain’s blue-chip index ending the shorter day little changed at 7,697.51.The midcap FTSE 250 ended the day 0.1pc higher at 19,598.24 amid strong retail sales data for November, although gains were held back by data showing the UK economy is at risk of recession.Meanwhile, the pound has risen 0.3pc against the dollar to move well above $1.27.Brent crude in London has dipped to be flat on the day at just below $80 a barrel.US stock markets have dipped ahead of the opening bell as investors await a key inflation report.The personal consumption expenditure data - the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge - could test an eight-week long rally on Wall Street driven by optimism that the Federal Reserve could lower interest rates next year.Economists expect the price index to show a 2.8pc rise on an annual basis in November, softening from a 3pc increase the month before.Core prices, excluding volatile items like food and energy, are expected to have risen by 3.3pc last month, compared with 3.5pc growth in October.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq finished over 1pc higher on Thursday after data signaled third-quarter US economic growth was not as robust as originally stated, aiding hopes that the Fed could reduce borrowing costs next year.All three indexes are poised for their eighth-straight week in the green, with the S&P 500 set for its longest weekly winning streak since 2017, and the Nasdaq and the Dow since 2019.Meanwhile, Nike plunged 11.9pc before the bell after the sports-wear maker trimmed its annual sales forecast blaming cautious consumer spending, a weaker online business and more promotions, and said it plans to cut supplies of key product lines to manage costs.In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3pc, the S&P 500 was little changed and the Nasdaq 100 slipped by 0.1pc.Gas prices are little changed despite the ongoing attacks in the Red Sea on vessels heading through the vital trade route.European benchmark contracts remained around €34 per megawatt hour, while the UK equivalent was static at about 85p per therm.Prices had ticked higher after the attacks by Yemeni militants on transports through the Red Sea.However, contracts have slumped by about a quarter over the last month as European supplies hold up. A mild winter so far has subdued demand.Regulated rail fares in England will increase by up to 4.9pc from March 3 next year, the Department for Transport has said.July’s RPI measure of inflation, which is traditionally used to determine annual fare rises, was 9pc. The previous cap on increases in regulated fares was 5.9pc.Transport Secretary Mark Harper said:Having met our target of halving inflation across the economy, this is a significant intervention by the Government to cap the increase in rail fares below last year’s rise.Changed working patterns after the pandemic mean that our railways are still losing money and require significant subsidies, so this rise strikes a balance to keep our railways running, while not overburdening passengers.We remain committed to supporting the rail sector reform outdated working practices to help put it on a sustainable financial footing.Unilever has agreed to buy fast-growing premium haircare brand K18 as it continues to shake up its stable of brands.The deal, for an undisclosed sum, comes after Unilever sold off some of its weaker performing brands in recent months.Earlier this week, the consumer giant announced it will sell a group of more than 20 brands including Timotei shampoo and Impulse body spray to private equity firm Yellow Wood Partners.The company also sold off its Dollar Shave Club business in October.K18 meanwhile is a rapidly growing business specialising in hair masks and other products to address hair damage, with celebrity fans including Hailey Bieber and Selena Gomez.The brand, which was founded in 2020 by Suveen Sahib and Britta Cox, has been buoyed by surging popularity through social media, recording around 20 billion TikTok views.One of the Bank of England’s most hawkish policymakers has signalled he may be ready to shift his stance on interest rates if inflation continues to cool.Prof Jonathan Haskel, one of a minority of Monetary Policy Committee members who pushed for rate hikes at recent meetings, tweeted that there was “news” in the latest inflation report, which showed the consumer prices index eased from 4.6pc to 3.9pc in November.The Imperial College Business School professor said that the fall in services inflation, which strips out volatile factors like air fares, seemed more “broadly based” than in previous months.However, he insisted that he would not shift his stance “based on one month data”.Personal view of the Nov CPI release and commentary: 1/31. News in latest data? Yes.2. News in previous months that was ignored? IMHO, no.Evidence.

Additional point: I wouldn’t want to make policy based on one month data.(End)— Jonathan Haskel (@haskelecon) December 21, 2023The pound has shifted higher after official figures showed better than expected retail sales in November.Sterling was up 0.1pc against the dollar to tip back above $1.27 after a sharp fall in inflation earlier this week sent its value lower amid increased bets on the Bank of England cutting interest rates.However, the pound was held back by official data showing Britain’s economy is teetering on the edge of recession.Sterling has risen 0.1pc against the euro to 86p.Oil extended its biggest weekly advance in two months as fresh attacks in the Red Sea prompted hundreds of ships to opt for safer but longer routes.Global benchmark Brent traded 1pc higher above $80 a barrel and is set for a second straight weekly gain after a string of seven declines. US-produced West Texas Intermediate rose 1.2pc above $74 a barrel.Freight rates have soared as more ships take extensive and costly detours - mostly around the southern coast of Africa - to avoid the risk of sailing through the Suez Canal and Red Sea.Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have been targeting everything from oil tankers to container vessels.Meanwhile, Angola announced on Thursday that it was leaving the Opec oil cartel, shrinking the group to 12 nations.The world’s largest gaming company led an $80bn (£63bn) sell-off in stocks in the sector after Chinese regulators announced a wide range of rules aimed at curbing spending and rewards that encourage video games.Tencent shares plunged as much as 16pc at one point while those of its closest rival, NetEase, plunged as much as 25pc after the draft rules were published.Online games will now be banned from giving players rewards if they log in every day, if they spend on the game for the first time or if they spend several times on the game consecutively. All are common incentive mechanisms in online games.The new rules, which will effectively set spending limits for online games, sparked panic among investors.Steven Leung, executive director of institutional sales at broker UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong, said:It’s not necessarily the regulation itself - it’s the policy risk that’s too high.People had thought this kind of risk should have been over and had started to look at fundamentals again. It hurts confidence a lot.Christmas getaway disruption is continuing with long queues for cross-Channel journeys, motorway closures and train cancellations.The Port of Dover in Kent said it is taking about 90 minutes to process cars with pre-booked tickets.It attributed the delay to a surge in demand for ferries after the Channel Tunnel rail link was closed on Thursday due to unscheduled industrial action by French workers, which ruined the travel plans of tens of thousands of people.Eurostar, which operates passenger services to and from London St Pancras, said it will operate two extra services per day between London and Paris up to and including Christmas Eve to help people whose trains were cancelled on Thursday.Vehicle-carrying train service Eurotunnel said it is running its usual timetable but is only accepting customers who have pre-booked.The M20 motorway in Kent remains closed in the coastbound direction between junctions 8 and 9 due to Operation Brock, which involves organising a queue for freight traffic during disruption to cross-Channel services.National Highways said this is causing 45-minute delays.London Underground workers will stage a series of strikes in the new year in a dispute over pay.Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) have voted overwhelmingly to take industrial action over a 5pc pay offer.Engineering and maintenance workers will be taking action over January 5 and 6, with no rest-day working or overtime until January 12.London Underground control centre and power/control members will be taking action over January 7 and 8, and fleet workers will walk out on January 8.Signallers and service controller members will take action on January 9 and 12 while all fleet, stations and trains grades will walk out on January 10.RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said Tube workers who help bring “vast amounts of value” to the London economy were not going to put up with senior managers and commissioners “raking it in”, while they were given “modest below-inflation offers”.JD Sports shares slumped as much as 6.9pc in early trading to the bottom of the FTSE 100 after Nike revealed it is seeking to make cost savings of as much as $2bn (£1.6bn).The US sports giant published a weak sales outlook after the closing bell on Wall Street, sending its shares down 12pc in after-hours trading, with revenues expected to be down in the third quarter of its financial year and up in the low single digits in the fourth quarter.Nike is seen as a bellwether for the sports fashion industry, with its weak performance hitting shares of retailers around the world.Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group, which owns Sports Direct, has fallen 0.9pc while Primark owner Associated British Foods has dropped 0.8pc.Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor said:Nike has struggled amid the weak consumer backdrop, heavy promotions and discounts, sluggish online sales and a slowdown in demand from the world’s second largest economy China.Sports retailers have been more cautious in terms of their stock purchases too, weighing on Nike’s wholesale business.While the US economy has thus far proven to be more resilient than expected, there are concerns about a slowdown coming through in 2024 which could hurt Nike.UK stocks slipped in early trading after a dour GDP reading left Britain teetering on the edge of recession.The blue-chip FTSE 100 and the domestically-focused FTSE 250 both edged down 0.1pc.Retailers were among the biggest fallers, declining as much as 1.5pc despite data showing shop sales rose by more than expected in November, as some commentators questioned whether the impact of Black Friday is waning.Life insurers were amongst top decliners, falling as much as 0.9pc.The FTSE 100 is eyeing a fourth straight weekly gain, while the FTSE 250 is set to rise for a third consecutive week.Global markets have rallied amid hopes that the US Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates early next year, while a surprise drop in inflation this week boosted UK equities.UK markets will close early at 12.30pm as traders head home for the Christmas holidays.Revolut has swung to a loss of £25.4m despite higher interest rates, as it faces a renewed battle over its attempts to secure a UK banking licence.Our senior technology reporter Matthew Field has the latest:The £24bn financial technology company recorded the pre-tax loss in 2022, falling from a profit of £39.8m a year earlier, while it recorded an increase in revenues of 45pc - to £922.5m.The numbers in its long-delayed accounts came after Revolut was forced to redesign its financial IT systems after its auditors issued a warning over its last set of accounts.The financial technology company was heavily scrutinised in March after its auditors, BDO, raised warnings over almost £477m of revenues in its accounts.For 2022, BDO said the “matter has been resolved” and it was satisfied it had seen “sufficient appropriate audit evidence” to verify Revolut’s 2022 numbers.Residential property prices in Germany continued their fall, dropping 10.2pc in the third quarter from a year earlier, a further grim sign for the nation’s real-estate sector, official data showed.Germany’s statistics office said the decline was the biggest since it began keeping records in the year 2000.The FTSE 100 fell at the opening bell as revised official data showed Britain could be falling into a recession.The UK’s blue chip index was down 0.5pc to 7,681.32 while the midcap FTSE 250 was down 0.1pc to 19,553.70.Markets are open for a shorter period today ahead of the Christmas holidays.The Prime Minister has “failed to grow the economy”, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said.Responding to the latest GDP figures, Labour MP Ms Reeves said:Rishi Sunak is a Prime Minister whose legacy is one of failure. He failed to beat Liz Truss, he failed to cut waiting lists, he failed to stop the boats and now he has failed to grow the economy.Thirteen years of economic failure under the Conservatives have left working people worse off with higher bills, higher mortgages and higher prices in the shops.It’s time for change. The Labour Party, led by Keir Starmer, has a long-term plan to grow the economy and make working people better off.The fall in GDP in the third quarter indicates that Britain may already be in the “mildest of mild recessions”, according to economists.Ashley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics, said:Whether or not there is a small recession, the big picture is that we expect real GDP growth to remain subdued throughout 2024.The breakdown of Q3 GDP showed that the drag from higher interest rates is starting to hit households harder.The 0.5pc quarter on quarter fall in consumer spending (revised down from 0.4pc q/q previously) was the first fall since Q4 2022.But the 0.4pc q/q rise in real household disposable income helped the saving rate rise from 9.5pc in Q2 to 10.1pc in Q3.With the full effects of higher interest rates yet to feed through to the economy, we think consumer spending will fall further in Q4 2023 and Q1 2024.Overall, today’s release suggests the economy was a bit weaker than we previously thought in Q3 and the mildest of mild recession may have begun. Looking ahead, the latest activity surveys point to weak GDP growth in Q4 too.After the UK’s economic performance was revised down for the second and third quarters, Quilter Cheviot’s head of fixed interest research Richard Carter, said:ONS data this morning reveals UK GDP fell by a surprise 0.1pc in Q3 compared to the previous quarter, revised down from a first estimate of no growth, highlighting just how much of a strain there currently is on the UK economy.Q2 was also revised down and is now estimated to have shown no growth compared to the 0.2pc increase previously estimated, meaning the UK has barely scraped by without a recession in 2023.Growth is weakening and interest rates are really beginning to bite and while a recession has just been avoided to date, there is no guarantee one will be avoided in 2024.You just have to look at October’s -0.3pc reading to see that growth is trending further in the wrong direction.Inflation has eased more than anticipated and interest rate predictions are suggesting more easing than originally thought in 2024, but the damage may already have been done. Certainly, Rishi Sunak’s pledge to grow the economy is now severely in doubt.This is going to ratchet the pressure up on the Bank of England to cut interest rates. The government would certainly like this given 2024 is likely to be an election year, but ultimately the Bank of England will stick to the narrative of the job is not yet done on inflation and it is too early to be talking about rate cuts.Black Friday is no longer giving the same boost to retailers, meaning the latest increase in retail sales figures should be viewed with caution, according to Lisa Hooker of PwC. She said:At a headline level, retail sales increased in November compared with October’s disappointing performance, with sales volumes - excluding petrol - up 1.3pc on the previous month, and they were also up 0.3pc vs the previous year.Almost all of the increase was due the early start to Black Friday which we identified in our online promotions tracker, as well as the more seasonal wetter and colder weather at the start of the month, encouraging more shoppers to spend earlier in the month.However, a note of caution interpreting November’s results as they did not include the whole Black Friday weekend.The longer term trend suggests that Black Friday is no longer giving the same boost to retailers as previously, with the non-seasonally adjusted sales peak falling every year since 2019. This echoes the findings of our own survey which showed a quarter fewer consumers interested in Black Friday overall.Indeed, non-food volumes remained 2.7pc below pre-pandemic levels, in spite of the apparent improvement last month.This means that, in spite of the headline improvement in sales last month, Christmas is still likely to come down to the wire for retailers. Consumers said they would spend less overall, but can they be persuaded to spend more than they planned in the final weekend before the big day itself? And, if not, the likelihood of bumper Boxing Day sales to clear seasonal stock will only increase.Regardless, the Golden Quarter will have been a disappointment for many retailers, and they will be hoping that the improving macroeconomic backdrop of lower inflation and increasing real wages will improve their outlook in the new year.Retail sales grew stronger than expected last month as shoppers snapped up Black Friday bargains and bought Christmas presents, according to official figures.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed that retail sales volumes increased by 1.3pc in November.It was ahead of the predictions of economists, who had forecast 0.4pc growth for the month.The ONS also revised its data for October upwards, reporting that there was zero growth in retail sales after previous estimating a fall of 0.3pc.Retail sales increased 1.3% in November 2023, from no growth in October.When we look more broadly, sales fell 0.8% in the three months to November when compared with the previous three months.➡️ https://t.co/o5Sbq4Djgm pic.twitter.com/ShLqgV9VV6— Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) December 22, 2023ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said:The latest data from both our regular monthly business survey and VAT returns show the economy performed slightly less well in the last two quarters than our initial estimates.The broader picture, though, remains one of an economy that has been little changed over the last year.The latest VAT data, which takes a little time to receive and process means we now estimate the economy showed no growth in the second quarter, with weaker performances from smaller businesses, particularly those in both hospitality and IT than first shown.We also now estimate the economy contracted slightly in the third quarter, when we previously reported no growth, with later returns from our business survey showing film production, engineering & design and telecommunications all performing a little worse than we initially thought.After the downward revisions for the economy, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said:The medium-term outlook for the UK economy is far more optimistic than these numbers suggest.We’ve seen inflation fall again this week, and the OBR expects the measures in the Autumn Statement, including the largest business tax cut in modern British history and tax cuts for 29 million working people, will deliver the largest boost to potential growth on record.The UK is teetering on the edge of a recession, official figures show, after initial estimates on the performance of the economy were revised down.Gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.1pc in the three months to September, according to the Office for National Statistics.Initial estimates had indicated the economy flatlined in the third quarter, and the subsequent estimates that the economy shrank by 0.3pc in October means the fourth quarter could also show a contraction.Two consecutive quarters of economic contraction are the definition of a technical recession.Britain’s economy is also estimated to have shown no growth in the second quarter of the year, revised down from a previously estimated increase of 0.2pc.The data will increase pressure on the Bank of England to cut interest rates early next year to avoid a deeper economic downturn.Separate figures showed this week that inflation fell to 3.9pc in November as households battled with 15-year high interest rates of 5.25pc.GDP is estimated to have fallen by 0.1% in Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2023, revised down from the previous estimate of no growth.Meanwhile GDP is now estimated to have shown no growth in Q2, revised down from the previous estimate of +0.2% growth.➡️ https://t.co/KjTIdncntf pic.twitter.com/xb7H0dRZKD— Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) December 22, 2023Thanks for joining me.

The company has significantly profited from increased demand for graphics processing units (GPUs), which are crucial for training AI models.Nvidia's business exploded this year. However, it is worth looking at companies at slightly earlier stages in their AI journeys, as they could have more room to run in the coming years.Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is an exciting option, with years of experience in the chip market. The company also plans to launch a new AI GPU in 2024.So, forget Nvidia. Here is why Intel is a magnificent AI stock to buy instead.It hasn't been easy to be an investor in Intel over the last few years. The company was responsible for more than 80% of the central processing unit (CPU) market for at least a decade, and was the primary chip supplier for Apple's MacBook lineup for years. However, Intel's dominance saw it grow complacent, leaving it vulnerable to more innovative competitors.As a result, Advanced Micro Devices started gradually eating away at Intel's CPU market share in 2017, with Intel's share now down to 69%. Then, in 2020, Apple cut ties with Intel in favor of far more powerful in-house hardware. Intel's stock subsequently dipped 4% over the last three years. Meanwhile, annual revenue tumbled 19%, with operating income down 90%.However, the fall from grace has seemingly lit a fire under Intel again. According to Mercury Research, from the second quarter of 2022 to Q2 2023, Intel regained 3% of its CPU market share from AMD.Moreover, Intel has pivoted its business to the $137 billion AI market, with plans to challenge Nvidia's dominance in 2024. The sector is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030, which would see it rise more than $1 trillion before the end of the decade.As a result, even if Intel can't dethrone Nvidia, projections show there will be plenty of opportunities for Intel to snap up market share and profit significantly from the industry's development.Earlier this month, Intel unveiled Gaudi3, a generative AI chip meant to compete directly with Nvidia's H100. The GPU will begin shipping in 2024 alongside Core Ultra and Xeon chips that include neural processing units, making them capable of running AI programs faster.Shares in Intel have soared more than 70% in 2023, almost entirely thanks to its prospects in AI. While that is nowhere near Nvidia's stock growth in the period, it could mean Intel has more to offer new investors in the coming years.The charts show Intel's earnings could hit nearly $3 per share over the next two fiscal years, while Nvidia's are expected to reach $24 per share. Therefore, on the surface, Nvidia might look like a no-brainer. However, multiplying these figures by the companies' forward price-to-earnings ratios yields a stock price of $130 for Intel and $939 for Nvidia.Looking at their current positions, the figures project Intel's stock will rise 184% and Nvidia's 95% within the next two fiscal years. While both boast impressive growth, Intel is forecast to deliver far more significant gains.The figures align with Nvidia's meteoric rise this year compared to Intel's more gradual expansion. Intel is just getting started in AI and could be in for a lucrative 2024. So if you're looking for an AI stock to add before the new year, Intel is a screaming buy right now instead of Nvidia.Should you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?Before you buy stock in Intel, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Intel wasn't one of them.

Trump frequently crowed about advances in stocks during his presidency but has changed his tune during President Biden's time in office.The major stock indices tumbled in 2022 but have rallied strongly this year. The benchmark S&P 500 is up 24% to a near-record level, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has surged 43%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 13% to an all-time high as well.Biden celebrated the strong performance by posting a campaign ad on X last week. It started with a clip of Trump warning in 2020 that \"if Biden wins, you're gonna have a stock-market collapse the likes of which you've never had.\" The video then cut to Biden smiling as cable news commentators hailed the stunning rally.\"Good one, Donald,\" Biden wrote.It's worth noting that many Americans don't personally own stocks, meaning they only benefit indirectly from market gains, for example if they boost their retirement accounts. Trump certainly isn't wrong to say that rising stocks enrich the wealthy, either.The world's 10 richest people have gained an estimated $470 billion in cumulative net worth this year, lifting their combined fortunes to nearly $1.5 trillion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Their wealth has soared in large part because they own large stakes in public companies that have seen their stock prices soar this year.For example, Warren Buffett's shares of his company, Berkshire Hathaway, make up over 98% of the investor's $119 billion net worth. Berkshire's shares have climbed 15% this year, making Buffett $12 billion richer on paper despite his gifting of $5.5 billion of stock to philanthropic causes.It's not surprising to see Trump try to disparage the stock market when Biden is actively pointing to it as evidence of his successful presidency. It may not be a surprise either to see Trump return to his previous stance on stocks if he's reelected.Read the original article on Business Insider"}

But keep in mind that the payment of a special dividend will decrease the share price by a similar amount, just as the regular dividend payment does. The share price may rise in the week before the ex-dividend date, so it behooves investors who wish to receive the special dividend to purchase shares as soon as possible.Collecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler. A new real estate fund backed by Jeff Bezos gives you instant access to a diversified portfolio of rental properties, and you only need $100 to get started.Miami’s housing market value has soared over 86% in the last two years and some investors found a simple strategy to profit from it. Here’s how you can do the same in these four cities poised for massive growth.Take a look at five REITs that have upcoming ex-dividend dates for special dividend payments in the last week of 2023. Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. (NYSE:PK) is a Tysons, Virginia-based hotel REIT with 43 hotels (plus two held in receivership) and resorts with over 26,000 rooms in prime U.S. markets with high barriers to entry. Properties in Hawaii account for 36% of its portfolio.Park was established as an independent company in January 2017 following its spinoff from Hilton Hotels Corp. (NYSE:HLT). In September 2019, Park acquired Chesapeake Lodging Trust to add premium-brand hotels and resorts in prime markets such as Miami, Boston, Los Angeles and San Francisco.On Dec. 1, Park Hotels declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.15 and a top-off dividend of $0.78, along with a previously announced $0.77 special cash dividend to be paid on Jan. 16 to shareholders of record on Dec. 29. The ex-dividend date for all three payments is Dec. 28, and Park Hotels shareholders will receive three dividend payments on Jan. 16.Host Hotels & Resorts Inc. (NASDAQ:HST) is a Bethesda, Maryland-based lodging REIT with 77 hotels containing 42,000 rooms in large markets across the U.S. Host Hotels is the only lodging REIT in the S&P 500 and has been in the index since 2007. Its hotel brands include Marriott, Hyatt, Four Seasons and Hilton.Host Hotels shareholders will receive two rewards in January. On Dec. 15, Host Hotels & Resorts announced an 11% increase in its fourth-quarter dividend from $0.18 to $0.20 per share and a special dividend of $0.25 per share. The dividends are payable on Jan. 16 to shareholders of record on Dec. 29. The ex-dividend date for both payments is Dec. 28. The dividend hike and special dividend increase the annual yield from 3.7% to 5.45%.Rayonier Inc. (NYSE:RYN) is a Yulee, Florida-based specialty REIT that invests in timberland in the U.S. and New Zealand. At the end of the third quarter, Rayonier owned long-term agreements on 2.8 million acres of timberland. Rayonier was established in 1926.On Dec. 18, Rayonier announced a one-time special cash dividend of $0.20 per common share, payable on Jan. 12 to shareholders of record on Dec. 29. The special dividend is the result of Rayonier's disposition of 55,000 acres of timberland in Oregon in the fourth quarter.SITE Centers Corp. (NYSE:SITC) is a Beachwood, Ohio-based retail REIT with 106 wholly owned shopping centers, 65% of which are anchored by grocery stores or high-quality discounters in affluent areas of the U.S. Its third-quarter lease rate was 94.4%. In October, SITE Centers announced it would spin off 61 convenience sector properties into a separate REIT called Curbline Properties. The spinoff is expected to take one full year, and Curbline is slated to start with a net cash position and no debt.On Dec. 13, SITE Centers declared a special dividend of $0.16 per share, payable on Jan. 12 to shareholders of record on Dec. 27, with an ex-dividend date on Dec. 26. The special dividend is from the sale of about 15% of SITE Centers' asset base this year. Farmland Partners Inc. (NYSE:FPI) is a Denver-based, internally managed specialty REIT that invests in farmland and originates loans to farmers that are secured by farm real estate. Farmland Partners is the No. 1 farmland REIT by total acreage, owning or managing over 300 farms totaling 178,216 acres in 20 states. Its properties produce 26 crops and have over 100 tenants. Farmland also owns properties in Ohio leased by four agriculture equipment dealerships.On Dec. 12, Farmland Partners announced a special dividend of $0.21 per share, payable on Jan. 12 to shareholders of record on Dec. 29. The ex-dividend date is Dec. 28. The special dividend is because of the sale of 35 farms in 2023 for $71.1 million with an aggregate gain of $10.3 million. The special dividend is on top of the regular $0.06 per share quarterly dividend payable on Jan. 16 to shareholders of record on Jan. 2, with an ex-dividend date of Dec. 29.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it's too late.

{"date": "2023-12-23-11-27", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/bull-market-coming-2-growth-133000804.html", "text_blocks": "With the S&P 500 now down just 1% from its record level, the benchmark index could be on the verge of reaching a new peak and ushering in the next sustained bull market.But while the index has posted impressive gains across this year's trading and is teetering on entering a new bullish phase, the S&P 500's big rally this year has largely been driven by megacap tech stocks with premier positions in artificial intelligence -- such names as Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Apple.But when the next bull market with legs hits, there's a good chance that high-quality stocks which still trade down big from previous highs will bounce back and deliver strong performance. With that in mind, read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors think that investing in these top companies would be a great move now.Jennifer Saibil: I was wary of the hype surrounding SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI) when it went public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in June of 2021. It was untested, with an astronomical valuation and no profits. I'm not surprised the stock fell off a cliff in the bear market.Since then, however, several things have happened. Growth remains high, but the valuation has declined and profits are improving. And that's just the very top layer of the story.SoFi's one-stop shop for digital financial services is resonating with its core customer base of students and young professionals. It acquired Golden Pacific Bancorp in 2022, and with it, a bank charter. It now offers a full suite of services like bank accounts and credit cards.It's focused on providing an easy-to-use interface with low fees and high rates, and as members join and have a positive experience, they're adding more services. That's leading to scaling up without significant extra marketing costs and thus improved profitability.In 2023's third quarter, revenue increased 27% year over year, a slowdown from previous quarters. But it added 717,000 new members, a 47% year-over-year increase (an acceleration) and more than 1 million new products.Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) increased 121% to $98 million. That's how SoFi has been measuring profitability, and it's important to watch the movement in this metric.But it's also important to note progress in its path toward net profits, and how well it's generating cash. Its net loss actually ballooned in the quarter due to a goodwill impairment, but management reaffirmed that it will reach net profitability in the fourth quarter. As for cash, since SoFi now has deposits in addition to its original lending products segment, it has plenty of cash to run its business.At the current price, the stock trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 4.6. While not objectively cheap, it's a valuation that takes SoFi's phenomenal growth into account. At this point in the story, SoFi has demonstrated that it can keep up the momentum in revenue while driving profitability.It looks like we're right around the corner from a bull market, and SoFi is the kind of growth stock that thrives in positive market conditions. If it begins to report net profits, expect the stock to soar in 2024.Keith Noonan: While Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) stock has seen some volatile swings since going public in December 2020, the company has generally continued to post very encouraging business results. Revenue grew 18% year over year to reach $3.4 billion in the third quarter, and adjusted net income surged 33% to reach $1.6 billion and deliver a 47% net income margin.Meanwhile, the business has now generated $4.2 billion in free cash flow (FCF) over the trailing-12-month period, coming in at roughly 44% of total sales across the period. That's a fantastic margin, and it points to the potential for the stock to deliver impressive returns for investors who take a buy-and-hold approach at today's prices.With a market capitalization of roughly $95 billion, Airbnb is valued at less than 23 times its trailing FCF. Given that the business is posting such strong margins and still growing revenue at a solid clip, the rental-platform leader's valuation continues to look attractive for long-term investors.Airbnb's growth story is likely just getting started. Total active listings on the platform grew 19% year over year in the third quarter, and management continues to make smart moves to ensure that its platform is appealing to both property hosts and guests.A growing number of listings on the platform should help ensure that a wide variety of offerings across a wide range of price points is available. Boosting active listings will likely also be a key catalyst in driving the work-anywhere, live-anywhere trend that remains an underappreciated contributor to the platform's long-term expansion potential.With the stock still trading off 32% from the valuation peak that it reached in February 2021, Airbnb looks poised to deliver plenty of long-term upside and stands out as a smart buy for investors seeking growth at a reasonable price.Should you invest $1,000 in SoFi Technologies right now?Before you buy stock in SoFi Technologies, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and SoFi Technologies wasn't one of them.

But both current and future retirees need to have a realistic idea of what their retirement benefits will actually do for them.That's why it's so important to know what the average Social Security benefit will be in 2024, as the amount may surprise you. Here's what it is.In 2024, the average Social Security check will provide $1,907 in monthly income. That's up from $1,848 in 2023. The average benefit increased thanks to a cost of living adjustment (COLA) occurring in 2024 that will result in larger payments to help retirees keep pace with inflation.While the average benefit amount did increase for next year, you'll probably notice that it is not a very high number. If you get a payment of just $1,907 per month, that would give you an annual income of only $22,884. That's not exactly a fortune, especially when you consider all the costs you'll have to pay from it, including housing and healthcare.Unfortunately, it's not a glitch that the average benefit provides such a limited amount of money for retirees to cover all their essentials. The reality is that Social Security was designed to replace only about 40% of pre-retirement income. So, even if your benefit is well above this average, it will still provide you with only a small fraction of the money you received when working.Social Security wasn't designed to provide more than about 40% of the money you were earning because it was meant to be one of three sources of retirement income. Savings and a pension from an employer were supposed to be the other two sources. And that becomes a huge problem for people whose employers don't provide a pension, who didn't save, or who saved but may not have saved enough or invested wisely.To be comfortable in retirement, seniors will need to replace about 80% to 90% of their pre-retirement income (or more) depending on just what they're hoping to do with their time (and whether their health is good). That means anyone wanting a comfortable retirement will need plenty of money besides what Social Security offers.If you are a long way from retirement, hopefully, seeing this low average benefit will prompt you to make a serious effort to increase the amount you're saving and investing for the future. Start putting away as much as you can into a 401(k) or other tax-advantaged retirement account today so you'll be ready when your day comes to leave the workforce.And if you are already in or close to retirement, it's important to look for extra income sources beyond Social Security. You can also make major lifestyle cuts, including choosing an area with a low cost of living if it turns out that you're over-reliant on these benefits and you discover they don't go as far as you hoped they would.The $21,756 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlookIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $21,756 more... each year!

These companies give investors a raise every year just for holding shares. And one company has been very generous in recent years, including a 16% bump for shareholders this month.Mastercard (NYSE: MA) just raised its quarterly dividend to $0.66 per share, payable to shareholders of record on Jan. 9, 2024. It's now paying double what it paid shareholders in 2019. And there's reason to think the fintech giant will continue to grow its payout at a similar pace for years to come.Here's why dividend growth investors should consider adding Mastercard to their portfolio ahead of its next dividend payment.Mastercard is one of two payment networks along with Visa (NYSE: V) that nearly all credit card issuing banks use to process payments. The company processed $8.7 trillion of transactions over the last 12 months. Only Visa has processed more ($14.8 trillion).The reason Mastercard is a top choice for credit card issuers is it's spent decades building a network of merchants that run its credit and debit cards. It's practically universally accepted all over the world. That creates a significant hurdle for new competitors to overcome, as it's taken decades for Mastercard to reach this point.The rise of digital payments (and declining use of cash) over the last decade-plus fueled strong profit growth for Mastercard. The company can process as many transactions as consumers and businesses need with minimal additional investment in building out its network or technology.As a result, Mastercard produces a generous operating margin. What's more, it's able to produce margin expansion over time. Through the first nine months of the year, adjusted operating margin improved 0.9 percentage points, reaching a whopping 58.6%.Over the last three years, Mastercard's improved its free cash flow by over 50%. It produced nearly $10 billion in cash for investors over the last 12 months. And it returns nearly all of that cash to shareholders through its growing dividend and share repurchase program. Along with its announcement to increase the dividend, management said the board approved a new $11 billion share repurchase program on top of the existing authorization to buy back $3.5 billion worth of shares.After its recent dividend increase, Mastercard's dividend yields 0.64%. That might not seem like much, but if it keeps raising the dividend that could become a substantial payment in the not-too-distant future.There are several reasons to think Mastercard can keep growing the dividend. First of all, the aforementioned share buyback program creates a lot of room. For one, it reduces the share count, therefore reducing the total amount Mastercard needs to pay in dividends. Moreover, it represents a substantially larger sum than Mastercard's dividend payments, which totaled $2.1 billion over the past 12 months. Over time, investors can expect Mastercard to shift more of its capital returns to dividends.What's more, Mastercard is still growing quickly. As a smaller company than Visa, it has more room to grow, especially in emerging markets. Meanwhile, the secular trend in digital payments is still in the early stages, as many economies are still heavily reliant on cash (including Europe).As such, investors should expect strong free cash flow growth over time as Mastercard's revenue grows, it leverages its network advantage to expand its operating margin, and that trickles down into exceptional free cash flow. After doubling its dividend in four years, it wouldn't be a surprise to see it double again before the end of the decade.Management's current focus on share repurchases is a sign it sees the stock is still undervalued by the market. While shares trade for a premium to Visa at 37 times trailing earnings (compared to 31x), the premium may be worth the price. Mastercard is growing faster, and analysts expect it to exhibit substantially faster growth on its bottom line over the next five years than its bigger competitor. As such, it's worth adding Mastercard to any dividend growth portfolio, as you can buy shares at a fair price and receive annual raises for the foreseeable future.Should you invest $1,000 in Mastercard right now?Before you buy stock in Mastercard, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Mastercard wasn't one of them.

His disdain for the rigidity of US securities laws has sometimes led to trouble with regulators, including a high-profile fight with watchdogs over tweets about Tesla Inc. Musk is also the chief executive of SpaceX, one of the world’s most valuable closely held companies.“There’s a lot of pressure, like immense pressure on a public company to not have a bad quarter. So this can actually result in a less efficient operation where you’re going to great lengths at the end of the quarter to not disappoint people,” Musk said in a Spaces discussion streamed live on the social-media platform X. The “time horizons do not match between investors versus a company’s long-term vision.”Musk has tangled in the past with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which he dubbed the “Shortseller Enrichment Commission” in 2018. That year, the billionaire agreed to pay a $20 million fine to resolve the agency’s complaints about tweets suggesting he was taking Tesla private. As part of the deal, he agreed to clear future posts about his firm with an internal monitor, or “Twitter sitter.”Musk later bought the social media platform, renaming it X. Earlier this month, he asked the US Supreme Court to consider invalidating that requirement, arguing it violates his free speech.Read More: Supreme Court Seeks SEC Response to Musk Social Media AppealMusk said keeping SpaceX private has also allowed him to take more appropriate risk compared with Tesla. One benefit of taking Tesla public, however, has been the company’s access to capital, he said.Still, Musk told Wood that he wouldn’t recommend that companies go public “unless they really have to.” Taking Twitter private has allowed him to make dramatic changes at the company without pressure from public investors. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey had long argued that the social media company struggled because of public investors, and encouraged Musk to take it private to help fix its business.For more on Musk, subscribe to the Elon, Inc. podcastWood and Musk also discussed how passive investing has punished stocks that are not in major indexes and unequally rewarded companies that are in key benchmarks. Their comments come as academic critics continue to lament that the passive-investing boom is distorting stock prices and causing extreme market moves.While Musk praised Vanguard Group Inc. founder Jack Bogle for bringing passive-investing into mainstream finance, he said the money-management trend has “gone too far.”“The percentage of the market that is passive is simply, is too great at this point. At the end of the day, somebody actually has to make an active decision. The passive investors are riding on the decisions of the active investors,” Musk said. “You get essentially massive movements of the stock, based on the decisions of maybe four or five active major stock pickers.”Wood’s flagship ARK Innovation exchange-traded fund (ticker ARKK) is actively managed, and has almost zero overlap with the S&P 500, according to an analysis from Bloomberg Intelligence.Musk’s Tesla joined the US benchmark roughly three years ago but has lagged since joining.Wood has long been an a fan of Musk.

Mass affluent individuals, with their robust yet accessible wealth, form a vital economic backbone in the United States, while high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) exert more influence across markets. Exploring these groups’ nuanced characteristics and strategies can help propel you toward a brighter financial future. HNWIs have more assets than those who are mass affluent but represent a smaller section of the population.If you’re wondering how to grow or protect your net worth, consider talking to a financial advisor.Mass affluent individuals have between $100,000 and $1 million liquid assets with an annual household income above $75,000. While these individuals have less financial resources than high-net-worth individuals, they make up about 26% of America’s population. They are also the second-largest economic subsection of consumers in the country, living an upper-middle-class lifestyle and holding substantial liquid assets (as opposed to illiquid assets, such as real estate).The defining factor of mass affluent individuals is the combination of income and assets. As a result, individuals who fit part of the definition (either an income above $75,000 or assets above $100,000) aren’t mass affluent individuals.A high-net-worth individual (HNWI) is a person who owns at least $1 million in liquid assets, excluding assets like a primary residence or collectibles. Because definitions of individual wealth in America have soared well beyond the $1 million mark, HNWIs fall into one of three subgroups:High-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) have liquid assets between $1 million and $5 million.Very-high-net-worth individuals (VHNWIs) have liquid assets between $5 million and $30 million.Ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs) own more than $30 million in liquid assets.Due to their substantial assets, high-net-worth households often require specialized services from financial advisors and wealth managers, including investment management, tax advice, assistance with trusts and estates, and access to hedge funds and private equity firms.HNWIs play a crucial role in the economy because they often invest in businesses, real estate and financial markets, which can drive economic growth, create jobs and stimulate innovation. Likewise, due to their financial standing, HNWIs often have access to exclusive investment opportunities, private equity deals and high-end financial products and services that may not be available to the general public.Lastly, HNWIs typically prioritize multi-generational wealth. They work with estate planners and financial advisors to ensure a smooth transition of assets to heirs or beneficiaries. As a result, they usually arrange living trusts and create wills to ensure their wishes for their wealth are carried out in a detailed manner.Here are three key differences between mass affluent Individuals and HNWIs:Liquid Assets: Mass affluent individuals have less wealth than HNWIs. Specifically, their wealth ranges between $100,000 and $1 million in liquid assets. In addition, mass affluent individuals, by definition, have an annual income of at least $75,000, while HNWIs don’t have an income threshold as part of their categorization. Instead, HNWIs solely have liquid assets of more than $1 million. Plus, HNWIs break into distinct groups as their asset amount stretches upward.Population Size: The mass affluent category encompasses around 26% of America’s population (a total of 32.3 million households). On the other hand, HNWIs account for 10% of the population (12.1 million households). As a result, mass affluent individuals represent a wider swath of the country’s demographics. HNWIs are a smaller segment, indicating a higher concentration of wealth among fewer households.Distinguishing Characteristics: The two groups also have sets of defining characteristics. For example, 40% of mass affluent individuals are baby boomers. In addition, they are typically (though not exclusively) white-collar and married. Conversely, HNWIs tilt toward entrepreneurial activity and have typically built and sold a business in their lifetime.To see which category you fall in, you can calculate your net worth with a straightforward formula. To do so, you’ll subtract your liabilities (specifically, any substantial debt you carry) from your assets. Remember, while mass affluent individuals and HNWIs don’t count their primary residences in their net worth calculation, counting your primary residence toward your net worth if you aren’t in one of those categories helps you see your full financial capacity.Here’s an example: Say your home is worth $500,000 and you have $300,000 left on your mortgage. You have two cars worth a total of $15,000. In addition, you have $10,000 in your bank account and $50,000 in your retirement account. You also have $20,000 in remaining student debt and $25,000 in auto loans.So, your total assets are: $500,000 + $15,000 + $10,000 + $50,000 = $575,0000And your total liabilities are: $300,000 + $20,000 + $25,000 = $345,000Therefore, $575,000 – $345,000 = a net worth of $230,000.Increasing your net worth is realistic even if you aren’t a mass affluent individual or HNWI. Here are three tried-and-true strategies to expand your net worth:Compound interest is a powerful financial concept that involves earning interest not only on the initial amount of money you invest (or save) but also on the interest that accumulates over time. This way, your money grows at an accelerating rate.As a result, begin investing or saving as early as possible. The longer your money has to compound, the more significant the growth will be over time. Furthermore, instead of withdrawing your earnings, reinvest them back into your investments or savings. This tactic enhances the compounding effect.Successful investing requires contributing regularly to your portfolio, regardless of market conditions. Remember, the stock market has provided an annualized average return of over 10% in the last 50+ years. So, a monthly deposit to your investment account during both economic booms and busts will help you get further than trying to time the market or throwing all your money into a savings account.Investing in a fund that spreads your capital across different asset classes helps diversify your portfolio, maximizing opportunities across the market. Lastly, it’s critical to periodically review your investment strategy and make adjustments based on your financial goals, risk tolerance and market conditions.Minimizing debt involves managing and reducing liabilities, such as credit card debt, mortgages and loans. Doing so reduces the interest you pay and frees up more of your income for savings and investments. Specifically, by focusing on paying off high-interest debts first, you’ll save money over time. This rule can also apply to delaying investments to prioritize debt. For example, a $10,000 credit card balance with a 20% interest rate will incur more debt through interest than a retirement account growing at 7% per year.Understanding the distinctions between mass affluent individuals and HNWIs provides valuable insights into navigating America’s diverse financial landscape. Mass affluent individuals, comprising a significant portion of the population, possess substantial liquid assets ranging from $100,000 to $1 million, with an annual household income above $75,000. On the other hand, HNWIs have a net worth of over $1 million. On an individual level, calculating net worth by subtracting liabilities from assets offers a clear perspective of your financial wellness. Implementing the right strategies fosters financial growth, stability and security, paving the way for a more prosperous future.Building wealth can be challenging because of debt problems or the lack of investment knowledge. In addition, retirement planning raises questions about tax liabilities, lifestyle choices and risk preferences. Fortunately, a financial advisor can help you gain clarity on these issues and move forward with a customized financial plan.

Not that anyone should blindly follow, but seeing where they think the market could move can provide insights into what you should be doing.Many people have done this with Warren Buffett's trades at Berkshire Hathaway for years, but they only reveal their trades once every quarter in a 13F document. Cathie Wood and Ark Invest don't follow those same guidelines; they post their daily trades on their website. This allows us to see what they're doing in real time, and they've recently made some big moves in The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) stock.Since Nov. 10, Ark Invest (in its various funds) has purchased 1.42 million shares of The Trade Desk. At today's prices, that's worth about $107 million. So, what happened around Nov. 10 that triggered Ark's buying spree? The Trade Desk's earnings report was released on the evening of the Nov. 9.Investors didn't like what they heard from The Trade Desk, so they promptly sent the stock down by 17%. But what was so bad in this report?At face value, everything seemed normal: Revenue was up by 25% year over year to $493 million, and net income rose from $16 million to $39 million. Customer retention also remained over 95%, marking nine years straight of strong retention.But the problem investors had with the quarter was its guidance for the fourth quarter. Management only guided for $580 million in revenue, indicating 18% growth. Besides one quarter in 2020, this would mark the slowest The Trade Desk has grown in its existence. As for The Trade Desk's preferred profitability measure -- adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) -- it's only expected to grow 10%. This is a problem because investors see a massive market opportunity in front of The Trade Desk, and it hasn't reached max profitability yet.However, Wood and her team at Ark Invest believe this is just a single quarter of slowdown, plus management may be sandbagging projections. These are both real possibilities, and with the massive buy-side advertising market coming online as more TV viewers switch to streaming, The Trade Desk should be fine over the long term.But should you follow their lead and load up on The Trade Desk?Since the third-quarter results caused a sell-off, The Trade Desk stock has quickly marched back to where it was before the report and is only down about a percent from its pre-earnings figure. So, the screaming deal that Ark got right after the earnings report is no longer available.With The Trade Desk trading at some expensive valuations, it also may be smart to hold off for a bit.When a company's revenue growth dips below its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, it should be an immediate red flag. Ideally, its growth would be two to three times its P/S valuation, but growing slower than its P/S valuation is a cause for concern.When earnings are considered, The Trade Desk trades at 53 times 2024 earnings, which isn't cheap but isn't terrible considering its huge market opportunity.So what should investors do?If you're already a The Trade Desk shareholder, I don't think now is a smart time to add to your position. However, if you don't own shares, The Trade Desk is a phenomenal company in a quickly evolving industry. Establishing a full position now isn't smart, but picking up a small bit so it's in your portfolio to monitor is a wise strategy. That way, if it dips again, you'll be easily alerted when it's time to increase your position sizing.The Trade Desk may have been a great deal a month ago, but right now, it's very expensive.Should you invest $1,000 in The Trade Desk right now?Before you buy stock in The Trade Desk, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and The Trade Desk wasn't one of them.

The law also provides that employers can only reject prospective employees based on their criminal history when their convictions have a direct relationship to a job.The agency said it has investigated hundreds of complaints alleging violations of the Fair Chance Act since the law was adopted and has secured about 70 settlements, including separate $100,000 settlements with a fire protection district and a construction company.The agency said it could not reach a settlement with Ralph's, prompting it to sue.(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Leslie Adler)"}
{"date": "2023-12-23-11-27", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/2-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-112000831.html", "text_blocks": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have been in the limelight over the past year, thanks to the massive impact this technology is likely to have across multiple industries, with McKinsey estimating that AI adoption could add a whopping $13 trillion to the global economy by 2030.There are many ways investors can capitalize on this huge opportunity. Two companies that stand to win big from AI adoption in two distinct industries are Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and SentinelOne (NYSE: S).Both stocks have been on fire in 2023. While shares of AMD have jumped 113%, SentinelOne has shot up 83%, with a big chunk of that jump coming since the beginning of November. The recent stock price action of both companies suggests they may already have gone parabolic -- which refers to a rapid jump in the share price of a company in a short time, similar to the right side of a parabolic curve.However, there is a solid chance that these two AI stocks could go on another parabolic run in 2024.Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the leader in the market for AI chips. The company reportedly controls between 80% and 95% of this lucrative market, which is going to be worth an estimated $45 billion this year as per AMD's estimates.Nvidia's dominant share explains why it has been growing at a terrific pace in recent quarters. The company's fiscal 2024 third-quarter revenue (for the three months ended Oct. 29, 2023) was up 206% year over year to $18.1 billion. Nvidia is forecasting its fiscal fourth-quarter revenue to increase at a faster pace of 233% year over year to $20 billion.AMD, however, is aiming to end Nvidia's free run in the AI chip market with its MI300 series of data center accelerators. Earlier this month, AMD announced the availability of its latest AI accelerators, which will be deployed by the likes of Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Oracle in the cloud. Server manufacturers such as Dell and Super Micro Computer will also be offering server solutions based on AMD's new chips.It is worth noting that AMD's latest MI300 family of processors is based on a 5nm/6nm (nanometer) manufacturing node from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, popularly known as TSMC. This is identical to the node on which Nvidia's flagship H100 AI graphics processing unit (GPU) is based, indicating that AMD is looking to offer a competitive alternative to Nvidia's processors.What's more, AMD's flagship MI300X accelerator is packed with 192GB of HBM3 memory and has a peak bandwidth of 5.3 TB/second. That's higher than Nvidia's H100 processor, which is packed with 80GB of HBM and has a memory bandwidth of 3.35 TB/second. The specs could translate into solid real-world performance as well, with AMD claiming that its MI300X processor could go toe-to-toe with the H100 while performing certain AI tasks.As a result, it won't be surprising to see a big jump in AMD's AI-related revenue in 2024. The company is currently forecasting that it could sell at least $2 billion worth of AI chips next year, but that figure could be much higher considering that AMD could get its hands on a big chunk of supply from its foundry partner next year. Also, AMD sees a $400 billion revenue opportunity in AI chips by 2027, indicating that it could win big from this market in the long run.So, if AMD manages to get its hands on a healthy supply of AI chips to fulfill the robust end-market demand and indeed takes away some share from Nvidia, it could grow at a faster pace than Wall Street's expectations. Consensus estimates suggest that AMD's revenue could increase by 16% in 2024 to $24 billion, but there are emerging catalysts that could help it outpace those estimates. As such, it won't be surprising to see this AI stock go parabolic in 2024 and deliver more upside to investors.The adoption of AI in the cybersecurity market is set to grow rapidly in the long run. According to Bloomberg, generative AI-based cybersecurity spending could grow from just $9 million in 2022 to $14 billion in 2032 at a whopping compound annual growth rate of 109%.SentinelOne is already making the most of this opportunity, as the company's fiscal 2024 third-quarter results (for the three months ended Oct. 31, 2023), which were released on Dec. 5, indicate. The company's quarterly revenue jumped an impressive 42% year over year to $164 million, easily clearing the consensus estimate of $156 million. Even better, SentinelOne posted a smaller loss of $0.03 per share as compared to the prior-year period's $0.16-per-share loss. Analysts would have settled for a loss of $0.08 per share.The company has guided for fiscal 2024 revenue of $616 million, which would be a 46% jump over last year. SentinelOne was earlier anticipating $605 million in revenue in the current fiscal year, but it seems like the growing adoption of the company's AI-powered cybersecurity platforms led it to increase the guidance.SentinelOne launched a generative AI-powered solution known as Purple AI to detect, analyze, and respond to cyber threats in April this year. An organization's security analysts could simply use text prompts to carry out cybersecurity operations, and the good part is that SentinelOne has already started delivering this offering to its customers.The company also provides an AI-powered cloud security solution, known as Singularity, which allows its customers to protect their cloud workloads. This solution should help SentinelOne tap the cloud security market, which is expected to generate $106 billion in annual revenue in 2029, as compared to $21 billion in 2021.These fast-growing markets should positively impact the company's growth and explain why analysts have raised their revenue forecasts of late. Not surprisingly, analysts are expecting SentinelOne to deliver solid growth over the next couple of years as well.SentinelOne stock is trading at 13.5 times sales right now. While that seems expensive at first, investors shouldn't ignore that the company has been growing at a nice clip and has justified its rich sales multiple with an impressive jump in revenue.Assuming it maintains a similar multiple after two years and hits $1.06 billion in revenue, as we saw in the chart above, its market cap could jump to $14.3 billion. That would be a 78% jump from current levels. However, don't be surprised to see this cybersecurity stock deliver even stronger gains and go on a parabolic run if it continues to outperform expectations and clock better-than-expected growth on the back of new catalysts such as AI.Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?Before you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Advanced Micro Devices wasn't one of them.

That's part of a record 21.4 million barrels per day for total US liquids production.\"Not only is the United States producing more oil than any country in history, but the amount of oil (crude oil, refined products and natural gas liquids) that it is exporting is near the total production of Saudi Arabia or Russia.\" Jim Burkhard, vice president and head of research for oil market, energy and mobility, said in the report on Tuesday. \"When you look back on 2008 — when US production was at a 62-year low, and exports were zero — it is a remarkable turnaround.\"The rise is consistent with a broader surge in US production, which has accelerated through this year. Separate data from the Energy Information Agency on Wednesday showed that US crude output surged to a fresh record high of 13.3 million barrels a day last week.Prior all-time highs were 13.2 million barrels a day in October and 13.1 million in February 2020, right before the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the economy.The strong output from US producers has offset OPEC+ production cuts this year that were meant to support slagging global oil prices.Between surging outflows outside of OPEC and the group's self-imposed limits, S&P sees the oil market headed for a \"new equilibrium\" next year with Brent barrel prices ranging between $75 and $100 in 2024.\"OPEC+ supply management keeps prices from falling below a certain floor, at least for any significant amount of time,\" Burkhard added. \"At the same time, prices remain high enough to support oil production growth outside of OPEC+, which in turn deters prices from surging too high.\"Supply growth outside of OPEC+ will grow to 2.7 million bpd in 2024, surpassing global demand growth of 1.6 million bpd.Booming US production has eroded OPEC's global market share, and some energy experts have predicted Saudi Arabia will flood the market with crude to gain back share.\"If prices stay high enough to sustain strong supply gains outside of OPEC+, then pressure rises on OPEC+ to cut more. Most of the time action is taken to support prices, but history shows that sometimes supply restraint and lost market share becomes an increasing burden,\" Burkhard said.Read the original article on Business Insider"}

He is also the founder of Citadel Securities, the largest market-making firm for the New York Stock Exchange and one of the largest designated market makers in the world. Citadel Securities is involved in one out of four stock trades placed in U.S. exchanges and nearly 40% of all retail trades.With a net worth of $37.5 billion, Griffin is one of the richest hedge fund managers in the world and is ranked No. 37 on the Forbes real-time billionaires list. His investments have reaped significant gains, as he returned $7 billion to clients last year after its profits surged over 30%.Griffin expects to make similar returns to investors this year, as his investment strategy generates outstanding returns. Citadel's multistrategy fund Wellington has gained nearly 15% year-to-date through November, making it one of the best-performing hedge funds this year. An inside source told Reuters that Citadel plans to divest approximately $7 billion in profits to investors this year to keep its total assets under management at $58 billion starting in 2024.Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here are three high-yield investments to add significant income to your portfolio.Apart from individual stock holdings, Griffin is a big believer in passive exchange-traded fund ETF investments, as approximately 1.12% of Citadel's portfolio is invested in SPDR S&P 500 ETF, making it the company's third-largest holding.Take a look at some of the top stocks in Griffin's portfolio.Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is Citadel's biggest holding, accounting for 1.72% of the total portfolio. Microsoft's blockbuster performance this year has reaped significant profits for Griffin, as the company's shares surged over 55% this year.Citadel also held 15.02 million shares of Activision Blizzard Inc. as of the third quarter ended Sept. 30. Griffin's fund bought shares of Activision Blizzard for approximately $87.06 per share, which were acquired by Microsoft for $95 each on Oct. 13. Griffin seems to have pocketed nearly $120 million from this acquisition.Microsoft's expanding reach in the field of artificial intelligence has also reaped substantial income for Griffin, as the Magnificent Seven stock hiked its quarterly dividends by over 10% to $0.75 on Nov. 15. Microsoft currently pays out $3 in dividends per share, yielding 0.81% on the current price. This should make a nice payday for Griffin, who holds 5.04 million shares of Microsoft through Citadel LLC.Boston Scientific Corp. (NYSE:BSX), one of the largest medical device manufacturers in the U.S., is Citadel's second-largest holding as of Sept. 30. Griffin holds 21.16 million shares of Boston Scientific through his hedge fund, accounting for 1.21% of his portfolio.Boston Scientific stock has gained almost 20% year to date and hit its all-time high of $55.68 on Dec. 13. Griffin bought Boston Scientific stock for an average price of $47.63 per share.The company's strong financials and growth prospects make it a compelling buy. In the third quarter, Boston Scientific's net sales rose 11.2% year over year to $3.53 billion. Net income increased by 190.2% from the same period last year to $505 million, translating to earnings of $0.34 per share.Analysts expect this momentum to continue, as the consensus revenue estimate of $3.59 billion for the fourth quarter ending this month indicates 10.8% year-over-year growth.\"We are well-positioned for the long term, backed by our category leadership strategy, strong pipeline of innovation and track record of strong commercial execution,\" Boston Scientific Chairman and CEO Mike Mahoney said.Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), the best-performing Magnificient Seven stock so far this year, is one of Citadel's top holdings, accounting for 0.97% of its portfolio. Nvidia has surged by over 242% so far this year and crossed the $1 trillion market cap in May.Nvidia's revenue rose 206% year over year to $18.12 billion in the fiscal third quarter, which ended Oct. 29. Operating income rose 1,633% from the same period last year to $10.42 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $3.71, up 1,274% year over year.Analysts expect the company's revenues to rise over 200% year over year to $18.4 billion in the quarter ending in January.  The consensus EPS estimate of $4.12 for the current quarter indicates 368% year-over-year growth.Despite gaining nearly 250% over the past year, Nvidia is well-positioned to surge further as analysts maintain a bullish outlook on the stock. Investment banking firm Stifel has a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $665, reflecting a potential upside of over 32%.Elon Musk may be adding landlord to his list of titles. Here’s how to join him in his latest venture with as little as $100.Collecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler.

The marijuana specialist's share price was up 9.9% as of 12:15 p.m. ET today, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.Tilray stock is gaining ground today on the heels of new product announcements and a fresh round of pardons from President Joe Biden for 11 individuals convicted of marijuana-related offenses. Even with the big pop, the company's share price is still down roughly 16% year to date and 93% from its high.Yesterday, Tilray published a press release announcing two new products in its Chowie Wowie cannabis-infused chocolate brand. The introduction of the new Soft Caramel and Crunchy Praline products suggests that the company continues to see long-term expansion potential in its Chowie Wowie brand.Chowie Wowie currently stands as the second-best-selling brand within its category in the Canadian market. With prices in the flower-based marijuana market still pressured by high levels of competition and a supply glut, Tilray and other companies in the space are looking to edibles and other alternatives as a way to boost margins.Besides the new product announcements, Tilray stock also appears to be getting a lift from President Biden's latest round of pardons for individuals convicted of marijuana-related crimes. While the plan for 11 new pardons comes in far below the thousands of pardons that the president issued last October, the move suggests there's a good chance that Biden will advocate for reforming marijuana laws when campaigning for reelection next year.Marijuana stocks have struggled in recent years. Some anticipated regulatory breakthroughs in potentially lucrative markets have been slow to arrive, and intense competition has made profits hard to come by.While Tilray doesn't look exorbitantly valued trading at roughly two times this year's expected sales, the company's ability to shift into delivering consistent profits and long-term earnings growth remains somewhat speculative. Trends do suggest that more geographic markets will see marijuana use decriminalized or legalized, but it remains to be seen if the business' current position in the space will translate into long-term staying power.While Tilray stock does have the potential to deliver explosive gains from today's prices, the current economics of the business mean that its shares remain a high-risk play.Should you invest $1,000 in Tilray Brands right now?Before you buy stock in Tilray Brands, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Tilray Brands wasn't one of them.

{"date": "2023-12-23-11-28", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/inflation-doing-something-hasnt-done-112900835.html", "text_blocks": "The primary measure of inflation is the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which represents the change in price for a basket of goods and services. The U.S. Federal Reserve has a mandate to keep inflation under control, and it targets a CPI increase of 2% each year.But significant changes in inflation above or below the Fed's target can have a huge impact on asset prices, especially for stocks and housing. The CPI is on track for a steep deceleration in 2023 -- of a magnitude similar to 2009 and the early 1980s. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) stock market index staged a huge move on both of those occasions, so here's what could happen in 2024.Too much inflation can place pressure on households and businesses because their money buys fewer goods and services, leading to a slowing economy. On the flip side, not enough inflation -- or even falling prices (deflation) -- can force businesses to pull back on production and lay off employees. That also hurts the economy.A few things can move inflation: interest rates, government spending, money supply, and supply chain shocks. Throughout the worst of the pandemic in 2020 and 2021:Interest rates were at historic lows.The U.S. government flooded the economy with trillions of dollars in stimulus.The Fed was using quantitative easing, which increases money supply to stimulate the economy.COVID-19 outbreaks caused factory closures around the world, which disrupted supply chains.All of those things were inflationary, so it's no surprise the CPI soared to reach a 40-year high of 8% in 2022, far beyond the Fed's target. It sent the S&P 500 plunging 18% for the year.In response, the Fed raised interest rates from 0.25% to 5.50% over the last 18 months to counteract that inflation. It's working so far with the latest CPI reading for Nov. 2023 coming in at an annualized rate of just 3.1%.With December almost in the books, the CPI is likely to end 2023 with an average annualized increase of 3.5%. That would mark a 4.5 percentage point decline from 2022, when the CPI came in at 8%.The last time the CPI slowed by more than 4 percentage points in a single year was in 2009, and before that, 1982.As I mentioned earlier, deflation tends to be bad for the economy and the stock market. But when the CPI is rising too quickly, a decline toward the Fed's 2% target is exactly what consumers, businesses, and investors want to see.It can boost corporate profit margins because businesses are paying less for their input costs, and it reduces prices for consumers leading to more economic growth. But most importantly, falling inflation prompts the Fed to reduce interest rates, which lowers the cost of capital. That means businesses can access funding more easily to grow and expand their operations.CPI inflation averaged 3.8% during 2008, but it collapsed 4.2 percentage points to negative 0.4% in 2009. The banking crisis ground the economy to a halt, which is why the CPI fell into deflation territory. But the Fed responded by slashing interest rates and introducing quantitative easing for the first time. Plus, the U.S. government stepped in to bail out some of the major U.S. banks. Those moves gave investors confidence that deflationary pressures would be short-lived.As a result, the S&P 500 ended 2009 with a gain of 26.4% (including dividends). But that's not all; inflation remained within the Fed's target for years even with interest rates near record lows, so 2009 sparked the beginning of a nine-year winning streak for the stock market.There was a similar occurrence in the early 1980s. CPI inflation hit 10.3% in 1981 which sent the S&P 500 tumbling 4.9%. But it slowed more than 4 percentage points in 1982, driving a 21.5% return in the stock market. Inflation continued to fall, and 1982 marked the beginning of an eight-year bull run for the S&P 500.The Fed hasn't started cutting interest rates yet, but the S&P 500 has jumped 24% in 2023 thanks in part to falling inflation. Plus, experts predict a shift in policy is right around the corner from the Fed. The CME Group's FedWatch tool points to a whopping six rate cuts next year!As was the case in 1982 and 2009, it's possible 2023 is the beginning of a multiyear bull market in the S&P 500. If history repeats itself, 2024 will likely bring more positive returns.Investors should keep an eye on CPI inflation in the coming months. So long as it continues to steadily decline toward the Fed's 2% target -- and absent any unexpected economic shocks -- the stock market will remain a great place for your money.Should you invest $1,000 in S&P 500 Index right now?Before you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and S&P 500 Index wasn't one of them.

He also pocketed $200 million from shorting U.S. Treasuries in October.Given his impressive track record of timing the market, heeding his predictions might reap significant returns. Ackman predicted in late November that the Federal Reserve would start slashing the federal funds rate as soon as the first quarter — before the Federal Open Market Committee's (FMOC) last meeting in early December.\"We're betting that the Federal Reserve is going to have to cut rates more quickly than people expect,\" Ackman said on \"The David Rubenstein Show: Peer-to-Peer Conversations.\" \"That's the current macro bet that we have on.\"Ackman's predictions came true after the Fed unveiled a dovish stance during the FOMC meeting, with Chairman Jerome Powell stating that the current macroeconomic indicators \"could just be a sign that the economy is normalizing and doesn't need the tight policy,\" according to CNBC.Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here are three high-yield investments to add significant income to your portfolio.Some of the biggest stocks that could benefit from slashed rates are as follows.Elon Musk has long conceded the disadvantages of keeping interest rates at record-high levels as they eat away at the affordability of electric vehicles. With most people living paycheck to paycheck with significant credit card debt, Tesla Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles seem to be a pipe dream, even with tax credits.“I think there's still quite a few shoes to drop on the bad credit situation. Commercial real estate, obviously, is in terrible shape. You know, credit card interest rates are usurious with over 20% interest rates, which over time becomes extremely punishing,” Musk said during an earnings conference call. \"So, you know, the auto industry is also somewhat cyclic. People hesitate to buy a new car if there's uncertainty in the economy.”As geopolitical tensions continue, Musk expects auto sales to remain under pressure, as the automotive industry is cyclical. With the Fed expected to cut rates soon, market sentiment is improving, and the demand for electric vehicles is expected to rise.Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Google's parent company, is Ackman's biggest portfolio holding, valued at approximately $1.2 billion. Ackman also holds 4.35 million of Alphabet's class A voting shares, valued at nearly $570 million as of Sept. 30.Alphabet has been struggling compared to its Magnificent Seven peers over the past year, as the company lagged capitalizing on the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. The company's generative AI platforms have failed to garner momentum similar to Microsoft Corp.-backed OpenAI's explosive ChatGPT platform.But Google has been making aggressive investments and is in acquisition talks to regain a competitive advantage. As interest rates fall, Alphabet's financing costs will drop, boosting its return on capital.On Dec. 6, Alphabet introduced its state-of-the-art artificial intelligence model Gemini AI, highlighting its advanced ability to analyze diverse forms of data, encompassing video, audio and text. Before this, Alphabet had committed nearly $500 million in funding to Anthropic AI, a company dedicated to creating a generative AI platform to compete with ChatGPT. Alphabet is also discussing acquiring Character.AI, a swiftly expanding startup specializing in AI chatbots.Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) is one of the largest construction and equipment companies in the U.S. and a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) Index. Caterpillar shares have surged over 22% year to date to hit its all-time high of $293 on Dec. 19. The industrial stock outperformed the benchmark DJIA index's 13.3% returns so far this year.Industrial stocks have historically benefitted from lower interest rates, which spur construction activity in the economy. Analysts expect Caterpillar's revenue to rise 6.4% year over year to $16.23 billion in the first quarter of 2024.Caterpillar is also a prominent dividend aristocrat, as the company raised its annual dividends consecutively over the past 30 years. The company pays $5.20 in dividends annually, yielding 1.82% on its current share price.Elon Musk may be adding landlord to his list of titles.

{"date": "2023-12-23-11-28", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/3-highly-risky-stocks-investors-141500953.html", "text_blocks": "Looking to buy some discounted stocks heading into 2024? There are some good deals in the markets, but there are also some potentially dangerous and risky stocks you may want to steer clear of now. Three stocks investors should tread very carefully with include Altria Group (NYSE: MO), Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG), and Canopy Growth (NASDAQ: CGC). Here's why you may want to think twice before adding these stocks to your portfolio.Tobacco giant Altria faces an uncertain future. Cigarette smoking is on the decline and the company is trying to transition to less harmful products, but that's easier said than done. Over the past nine months, the company has generated $18.5 billion in revenue, and of that, $16.5 billion has come from its smokable products. That's nearly 90% of its business.Its bread and butter is based on an industry that's in decline. The company says that the volume of domestic cigarette shipments has dropped 10.5% year to date. While its revenue won't go to zero tomorrow, this is a big problem that Altria needs to sort out before being a tenable long-term investment.Although the stock looks cheap -- it trades at less than 9 times earnings -- there's good reason for the discount given the underlying business faces many question marks. And its high-yielding dividend of 9.4% may look attractive, but it also comes with a lot of uncertainty because if Altria struggles to grow, a dividend cut may be a possibility in the near future.An even riskier stock than Altria is Plug Power. The green hydrogen company raised \"going concern\" issues recently, which means that it's not confident about its own ability to survive. There aren't much more serious red flags than that for investors. It's trading at just 0.8 times its book value and its shares are down 64% this year, and so some investors may feel compelled to take a contrarian position on the stock.But the risk is simply too high. The biggest problem with the business isn't even that it has posted a $726 million loss over the past three quarters. More alarming is the $864 million in cash it has burned through during that time frame. It can't afford to keep up that pace because the company only had $111 million in cash and cash equivalents as of the end of September; the risk for share dilution is high.There's not a whole lot of power left in Plug Power's stock. And while it has plunged this year, investors shouldn't expect a big turnaround in 2024. Investing in green energy can be a good move, but not if a company doesn't have strong enough financials to support its long-term growth.Another company that has raised going concern risks is Canadian cannabis producer Canopy Growth. The days of this being a promising growth stock are long gone. Instead, the company boasts of moving toward becoming an \"asset-light\" business as it looks to feverishly cut whatever expenses it can for the sake of keeping its operations afloat.But that isn't an easy task. It recently got rid of sports nutrition company BioSteel, which was its fastest-growing business unit. And on Monday, it also announced the sale of its skincare and wellness brand, This Works. Whether that's enough to stop the cash burn, however, is uncertain. And at the very least, disposing of assets will only ensure its top line continues to decline.Canopy Growth's net revenue totaled just under 70 million Canadian dollars for the period ended Sept. 30 and was down 21% year over year. On top of this, the company also burned through more than CA$66 million cash from its day-to-day operating activities. Its cash and short-term investments totaled CA$270 million as of the end of September, so the business does have some breathing room, but it's still in a tough situation.With the stock down 79%, investors are likely better off resisting the temptation to take a chance on this highly risky investment.Should you invest $1,000 in Altria Group right now?Before you buy stock in Altria Group, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Altria Group wasn't one of them.

After all, industry forecasts estimate the global AI market will grow from roughly $208 billion in 2023 to nearly $300 billion in 2024 and will continue expanding to reach $1.8 trillion by 2030.When it comes to investing in AI, you want companies where the technology is essential to their businesses. This positions them to prosper from the AI industry's growth over the long haul. This trio of stocks falls into that bucket. Each of these companies represents different aspects involved in the creation of an AI solution.It starts with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which provides the graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to handle the computing demands of an AI system. Next is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), as its Amazon Web Services (AWS) division delivers the data centers and other IT infrastructure needed to house and run AI programs. Finally, there's UiPath (NYSE: PATH), which illustrates the kinds of potent AI apps being produced today.Nvidia had a banner 2023, thanks to the popularity of its GPUs used in AI and cloud computing technologies. The company is positioned to repeat its success in 2024.AI systems require potent processing power, given the complex calculations they must perform. Nvidia's GPUs fit the bill, leading to sales of $18.1 billion in the company's fiscal third quarter, ended Oct. 29. That's a jaw-dropping 206% jump from the prior year's $3.8 billion.The company expects its fiscal Q4 to deliver $20 billion in sales, a huge leap from 2022's $6.05 billion and making for an impressive start to 2024.Nvidia's chips are used not only in AI, but also in other hot industries, such as electric vehicles and robotic systems. Moreover, the company formed a partnership with Foxconn to construct data centers specifically tailored to the demands of AI using Nvidia's technology.In describing these new data centers, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said, \"A new type of manufacturing has emerged -- the production of intelligence.\" As its 2023 results show, Nvidia possesses the technology and partnerships to succeed over the long term in this new AI manufacturing era.Nvidia built the chips that enable AI. Amazon's AWS delivers the computing infrastructure needed to run AI programs.AWS provides the servers where AI apps, and the mountains of data they require to make decisions, can be housed. Businesses can use AWS tools to implement AI systems, and corporations such as United Airlines are doing just that.AWS is already the largest cloud computing provider in the world, and it is strengthening its leadership position going into 2024. AWS and Nvidia are partnering to boost AWS data centers with Nvidia's latest AI tech, making Amazon an attractive vendor for businesses interested in implementing AI apps.And AWS isn't the only area where AI plays a role in Amazon's success. The company has infused AI across a number of its businesses.For example, Amazon now provides third-party sellers on its site with AI capabilities to help them create product listings. These sellers generated $34.3 billion of Amazon's $143.1 billion in Q3 sales, accounting for more revenue than the $23.1 billion delivered by AWS.Amazon's Q3 revenue was a 13% increase over the prior year, and the company expects at least 7% year-over-year growth in Q4. As Amazon continues to add AI capabilities, these improvements should help the company continue to grow revenue in 2024.Now, let's look at UiPath, a company that uses Amazon's AWS. UiPath helps businesses increase automation in their operations by using AI to analyze current workflows, then automating many of those steps.For instance, UiPath's AI can automatically fill out online forms, streamlining data entry. Several U.S. government agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service, are using UiPath's AI to automate tasks.As a result, the company's revenue in its fiscal third quarter, ended Oct. 31, grew 24% year over year to $326 million. UiPath's revenue growth has also helped its free cash flow (FCF).The company's Q3 adjusted FCF reached $43.7 million, a dramatic improvement over the prior year's FCF of negative $24.1 million. And its balance sheet is strong. UiPath had total assets of $2.8 billion, with over $1 billion in cash and equivalents exiting Q3. Total liabilities were $825.8 million.With strong financials, UiPath has the resources to expand its business, and its revenue growth illustrates the success of its AI offerings.Nvidia, Amazon, and UiPath are all going into 2024 with excellent financial results. With the growing AI market serving as a tailwind, these companies are poised to continue generating success in 2024.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

I've refinanced at 2.375% and can get a certificate of deposit (CD) for a year at 4%. I was adding to my mortgage payment by about $1,000 a month to pay it off in seven years instead of 14 years. I want to retire in seven years, and though my Social Security will be around $3,500, and my husband will still be working, I'm not sure if that is wise.-JanWhether you should pay off a mortgage early or invest more depends on what you'd hope to gain by choosing one over the other. It could be that you simply want to choose the option that leaves you better off financially. But you may want to consider risks, the effect on your budget, and purely nonfinancial factors as well.Here's how to think through this decision. (This tool can help match you with potential advisors while you navigate the lead-up to retirement.)  Comparing Your Mortgage Rate to Investment ReturnMany people like to frame the decision of whether they should pay off their mortgage as a tradeoff between the interest rate on their mortgage and the return they could earn if they had invested that money instead.The idea is that if they can earn a higher rate of return than what they pay in interest, they are better off. As a baseline, that is a logical approach.But another element of that decision is the risk associated with the investments. For example, suppose the money is instead invested in a stock portfolio. Even in a well-diversified one, there will be fluctuations in that portfolio's value. That same element of risk isn't present when you pay down a debt balance with a fixed interest rate. That's because you know the amount that you save – it's that fixed interest rate. So, the question evolves. You really need to compare the interest rate on your mortgage to the rate of return you can reasonably expect to earn on a portfolio that exposes you to an amount of risk you are comfortable with. Your time horizon matters a great deal in that analysis, and you should consider it. (This tool can help match you with potential advisors while you navigate the lead-up to retirement.) In any case, 2.375% is an incredibly low interest rate. It would be easy to make a mathematically supported argument for not paying that balance down any sooner than you have to. If you take the one-year CD at 4%, that's a fixed rate, so you won't have the same volatility considerations as you would with a longer-term investment. Just be sure to account for the tax implications. That CD interest is taxable. You may also be getting a tax deduction for the interest you're paying on the mortgage. Consider Your Preference in RetirementYou may not want to base your decision purely on a mathematical comparison. Consider your preferences and emotions, especially as you eye your potential retirement in seven years. Many people get a significant amount of satisfaction from paying off their mortgages.  Knowing that they own their home is appealing to them.While you can't put an exact dollar value on that satisfaction, you can approximate it. How? Simply ask yourself if you'd rather have the amount you estimate you'll have if you save that extra payment in seven years or a paid-off house. For some people, that satisfaction and the relief it brings are worth a lot. They would choose a paid-off house over saving a large sum of money. For others, it isn't worth much. They might choose to keep the mortgage and invest more, even if saving the money only results in a small gain relative to paying it off early. (This tool can help match you with potential advisors while you navigate the lead-up to retirement.) As people enter retirement and no longer receive paychecks, they tend to shift their preference in favor of a paid-off house. That's understandable, and not having a mortgage payment in retirement certainly increases the amount of flexibility in your budget. You imply in your question that this may be an important factor for you, or at least that it's on your mind. Bottom LineStart with the mathematical comparison. From there, consider how much weight you want to give to those other factors. Finally, make your decision based on the totality of the situation. Brandon Renfro, CFP®, is a SmartAsset financial planning columnist and answers reader questions on personal finance and tax topics.

In aggregate, the S&P 500 has a total return of close to 31,000% since the mid-1960s, as of the closing bell on Dec. 15. Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway's Class A shares (BRK.A) are higher by an aggregate of more than 4,400,000%! Outperformance of this magnitude is going to get a portfolio manager noticed.Warren Buffett and his investment team have long believed in buying into profitable, time-tested, brand-name businesses with trusted management teams. But the not-so-subtle secret to Berkshire's sustained outperformance might just be portfolio concentration.Both Warren Buffett and the late, great Charlie Munger, who served as the Oracle of Omaha's right-hand man for 45 years, have held the belief that extra capital should be allocated to top investment ideas. Despite holding stakes in more than 50 securities (including index funds), as of Dec. 15, Warren Buffett's $374 billion portfolio at Berkshire had 65% of its invested assets ($243 billion) tied up in just three stocks.To quote Charlie Munger,The idea of excessive diversification is madness. Wide diversification, which necessarily includes investment in mediocre businesses, only guarantees ordinary results.It's crystal clear by the nearly $181 billion of invested assets Berkshire has tied up in tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) that Warren Buffett and his team view it as a truly exceptional business. Further, it's pretty clear evidence that portfolio concentration in top investment ideas is a given.Apple's greatness can effectively be boiled down to its branding, innovation, and world-leading capital-return program.Earlier this year, Interbrand's annual \"Best Global Brands\" report labeled Apple as the most-valuable brand for an 11th consecutive year. It's a well-recognized and trusted brand globally, and it has an exceptionally loyal customer base, which is likely to have been initially drawn in by one of its physical products (iPhone, Mac, or iPad). Interbrand also attributes the continued growth of Apple's brand value to having its proverbial fingers in multiple product and service channels.This leads to the next point: Apple's innovation. Although it's been introducing new products for decades, the iPhone really put Apple on the map with consumers and growth-focused investors. Continued upgrades to iPhone have helped the largest company by market cap in the U.S. secure a majority share of smartphone sales domestically.Moreover, CEO Tim Cook is overseeing the evolution of Apple into a platforms company. An emphasis on subscription services, while concurrently continuing to produce the physical products that endeared consumers to Apple in the first place, should enhance the value of its product and service ecosystem, improve its long-term operating margin, and minimize the revenue fluctuations that often accompany major iPhone upgrade cycles.However, the factor Warren Buffett probably appreciates most about Apple is its unbeatable capital-return program. The company doles out $15 billion each year to its shareholders in dividends, and it's repurchased more than $600 billion worth of its common stock since the start of 2013.Although it's a distant second behind Apple, financial juggernaut Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) accounts for almost $35 billion of invested assets in the $374 billion portfolio the Oracle of Omaha oversees for Berkshire Hathaway.There's arguably no sector Warren Buffett is more proficient in analyzing than financials. This is why you'll often find plenty of bank stocks, insurance companies, and credit-service providers in Berkshire's portfolio.The reason Buffett gravitates to financial companies is that he understands the disproportionate nature of economic cycles. While recessions are perfectly normal, the 12 that have occurred in the U.S. following World War II have lasted between two and 18 months. By comparison, most periods of expansion endure multiple years, including two since World War II that lasted at least a decade. Buying cyclical financial stocks, like Bank of America, perfectly positions Buffett's company to take advantage of long-term economic growth.But there's more to like about Bank of America than just macro factors. Among U.S. money-center banks, it's the most interest sensitive of the bunch. Every time the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, variable interest rates increase. Since March 2022, the federal funds rate has risen by 525 basis points, which represents the steepest rate-hiking cycle in four decades. Higher interest rates have ultimately lifted BofA's net-interest income by billions of dollars each quarter.Furthermore, Bank of America has done a stand-up job of improving its operating efficiency. It's been investing in a variety of digitization initiatives that have steadily increased digital banking adoption rates. As more of its customers shift to online and mobile banking, BofA has had the option of consolidating some of its physical branches and reducing its operating expenses.To keep with the theme, Bank of America has a pretty impressive capital-return program of its own. It's set to return nearly $7.6 billion to its shareholders via dividends over the next 12 months. Additionally, BofA's board regularly approves substantial buybacks when market conditions allow for it.The third stock that, collectively with Apple and Bank of America, accounts for 65% of the $374 billion portfolio Warren Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway is credit-service provider American Express (NYSE: AXP).AmEx, as American Express is commonly known, benefits from the same long-winded macro catalysts as Bank of America. Though there's no escaping spending declines and/or loan losses during economic slowdowns and recessions, the U.S. and global economy spend a disproportionate amount of their time growing. Buffett and Munger understood this, which is why Berkshire has been a continuous shareholder of American Express stock for more than three decades.What makes American Express so special is the fact that it's playing both sides of the transaction aisle. On one hand, it's No. 3 in domestic credit card network purchase volume. Put another way, it's generating a healthy amount of fees from merchants while acting as a payment facilitator.However, AmEx is also generating interest income and fees from its cardholders. During lengthy periods of economic expansion, when credit delinquency rates and charge-offs are low, American Express can really shine from an operating standpoint.Something else that helps American Express thrive is its focus on higher-income individuals. The well-to-do are less likely to change their spending habits when minor economic disruptions occur or inflation picks up. This allows AmEx to move past challenging economic climates faster than other lending institutions.Warren Buffett and his investing aides are likely also enamored with American Express's capital-return program. In March, the company's board approved a new share repurchase program for up to 120 million shares of common stock. Further, AmEx's $2.40-per-share base annual dividend works out to a 28.3% yield relative to Berkshire Hathaway's cost basis in its No. 3 holding.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

Chevron and Hess recently received a request for additional information and documentary material from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in connection with the merger.See Also: IEA Forecasts Slowdown In Oil Demand, Contrasts Positive Outlook By OPEC+UBS analyst Josh Silverstein maintained Chevron with a Buy rating, lowering the price target from $194 to $185.Chevron, during October, reported third-quarter total revenues and other income of $54.1 billion, beating the consensus of $51.44 billion.With the recent buzz around Chevron, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company’s dividends. As of now, Chevron has a dividend yield of 4.01%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of $1.51 a share ($6.04 a year).To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Chevron dividends, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).Next, we take this amount and divide it by Chevron $6.04 dividend: $6,000 / $6.04 = 993 sharesSo, an investor would need to own approximately $149,655 worth of Chevron, or 993 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $6.04 = 199 shares, or $29,991 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.Also Read: Top 5 Industrials Stocks That Are Ticking Portfolio BombsNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.CVX Price Action: Shares of Chevron rose 0.3% to close at $150.71 on Thursday.Read More: This Jeff Bezos-backed platform has made real estate investing as easy as ordering stuff on Amazon.

Gains have been concentrated among a few large stocks, while profitable slower-growth companies are all but forgotten.I think the absurdly cheap values on the market today include Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ), PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL), and Deere & Company (NYSE: DE). Let's review.Shares of Verizon have been cheap for years, and for good reason. The company spends a lot of money on building out telecommunications infrastructure only to need to reinvest in the next generation a few years later.But that doesn't mean this isn't a cheap stock today. Shares are trading for just 7.6 times trailing earnings, and the dividend yield is 7.1%. The business is performing well, too.You can see below that capital expenditures are going down as free cash flow is increasing. This is because the 5G buildout is slowing and Verizon is entering a cash-harvesting phase of the cycle.There are growth opportunities for Verizon as the company expands 5G broadband service and bundles wireless service with streaming services, which I think will drive revenue growth. Its costs and cash flows are heading in the right direction, and that's great for a stock this cheap.Shares of PayPal have had a tough 2023, falling 17.6%, but they're now trading for 18 times earnings in a down point for the payments company. This year saw increased competition and lower margins for some transactions, but PayPal along with companies like Adyen have put a focus on growing profitably instead of growing at all cost.You can see below that free cash flow has fallen as margins have come under pressure, but that's the low point that I think presents an opportunity. PayPal hasn't suddenly become irrelevant in payments; it's just facing growing pains in relation to its margins.PayPal and a lot of other tech companies got caught up in growth during the pandemic, and it's taking time to bring pricing and its cost structure back to more appropriate levels. But that's why this is an opportunity for investors.One of the most crucial companies in construction and agriculture is Deere, and its shares are trading for an extremely cheap 11 times trailing earnings. And while this may be a cyclical company, the trends are getting stronger for the business. You can see that cash flow is improving and most of the company's segments are doing well.Production and precision agriculture revenue has more than doubled since fiscal 2019 to $26.8 billion, and construction and forestry revenue has jumped from $11.2 billion to $14.8 billion in that time. Total earnings before interest and taxes more than tripled.The world is going to need bigger, more advanced machines to feed people and build the future. Deere will be on the front lines of that revolution.The market has been bidding a lot of high-profile stocks up in 2023, leaving behind some of the companies that underperformed or don't have a lot of growth in the value bin. But that's an excellent place to shop right now to find great buy-and-hold stocks.Should you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now?Before you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Verizon Communications wasn't one of them.

If you have other sources of retirement income, such as a 401(k) or a part-time job, then you should expect to pay income taxes on your Social Security benefits. If you rely exclusively on your Social Security checks, though, you probably won't pay taxes on your benefits. State laws vary on taxing Social Security. Regardless, it's a good idea to work with a financial advisor to help you understand how different sources of retirement income are taxed.According to the IRS, the quick way to see if you will pay taxes on your Social Security income is to take one half of your Social Security benefits and add that amount to all your other income, including tax-exempt interest. This number is known as your combined income (combined income = adjusted gross income (AGI) + nontaxable interest + half of your Social Security benefits).If your combined income is above a certain limit (the IRS calls this limit the base amount), you will need to pay at least some tax.The limit is $25,000 if you are a single filer, head of household or qualifying widow or widower with a dependent child. The limit for joint filers is $32,000. If you are married filing separately, you will likely have to pay taxes on your Social Security income.If your Social Security income is taxable, the amount you pay in tax will depend on your total combined retirement income. However, you will never pay taxes on more than 85% of your Social Security income. If you file as an individual with a total income that's less than $25,000, you won't have to pay taxes on your Social Security benefits in 2021, according to the Social Security Administration.For the 2021 tax year (which you will file in 2022), single filers with a combined income of $25,000 to $34,000 must pay income taxes on up to 50% of their Social Security benefits. If your combined income was more than $34,000, you will pay taxes on up to 85% of your Social Security benefits.For married couples filing jointly, you will pay taxes on up to 50% of your Social Security income if you have a combined income of $32,000 to $44,000. If you have a combined income of more than $44,000, you can expect to pay taxes on up to 85% of your Social Security benefits.If 50% of your benefits are subject to tax, the exact amount you include in your taxable income (meaning on your Form 1040) will be the lesser of either a) half of your annual Social Security benefits or b) half of the difference between your combined income and the IRS base amount.Let’s look at an example. Say you’re a single filer who receives a monthly benefit of $1,543, which is the average benefit after the cost of living increase in January 2021. Your total annual benefits would be $18,516. Half of that would be $9,258. Then let’s say you have a combined income of $30,000. The difference between your combined income and your base amount (which is $25,000 for single filers) is $5,000. So the taxable amount that you would enter on your federal income tax form is $5,000, because it is lower than half of your annual Social Security benefit.The example above is for someone who is paying taxes on 50% of his or her Social Security benefits. Things get more complicated if you’re paying taxes on 85% of your benefits. However, the IRS helps taxpayers by offering software and a worksheet to calculate Social Security tax liability.If you’re ready to be matched with local advisors that can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.Once you calculate the amount of your taxable Social Security income, you will need to enter that amount on your income tax form. Luckily, this part is easy. First, find the total amount of your benefits. This will be in box 3 of your Form SSA-1099. Then, on Form 1040, you will write the total amount of your Social Security benefits on line 5a and the taxable amount on line 5b.Note that if you are filing or amending a tax return for the 2017 tax year or earlier, you will need to file with either Form 1040-A or 1040. The 2017 1040-EZ did not allow you to report Social Security income.During your working years, your employer probably withheld payroll taxes from your paycheck. If you make enough in retirement that you need to pay federal income tax, then you will also need to withhold taxes from your monthly income.To withhold taxes from your Social Security benefits, you will need to fill out Form W-4V (Voluntary Withholding Request). The form only has only seven lines. You will need to enter your personal information and then choose how much to withhold from your benefits. The only withholding options are 7%, 10%, 12% or 22% of your monthly benefit. After you fill out the form, mail it to your closest Social Security Administration (SSA) office or drop it off in person.If you prefer to pay more exact withholding payments, you can choose to file estimated tax payments instead of having the SSA withhold taxes. Estimated payments are tax payments that you make each quarter on income that an employer is not required to withhold tax from. So if you ever earned income from self-employment, you may already be familiar with estimated payments.In general, it’s easier for retirees to have the SSA withhold taxes. Estimated taxes are a bit more complicated and will simply require you to do more work throughout the year. However, you should make the decision based on your personal situation. At any time you can also switch strategies by asking the the SSA to stop withholding taxes.If you're concerned about your income tax burden in retirement, consider saving in a Roth IRA. With a Roth IRA, you save after-tax dollars. Because you pay taxes on the money before contributing it to your Roth IRA, you will not pay any taxes when you withdraw your contributions. You also do not have to withdraw the funds on any specific schedule after you retire. This differs from traditional IRAs and 401(k) plans, which require you to begin withdrawing money once you reach 72 years old, or 70.5 if you were born before July 1, 1949.So, when you calculate your combined income for Social Security tax purposes, your withdrawals from a Roth IRA won’t count as part of that income. That could make a Roth IRA a great way to increase your retirement income without increasing your taxes in retirement.Another thing to note is that many retirement plans allow individuals, aged 50 years or older, to make annual catch-up contributions. You can make catch-up contributions up to $1,000. These must be made by the due date of your tax return. You have until April 15, 2022 to make the $1,000 catch-up contribution apply to your 2021 Roth IRA contribution total.Everything we’ve discussed above is about your federal income taxes. Depending on where you live, you may also have to pay state income taxes.There are 12 states that collect taxes on at least some Social Security income. Two of those states (Minnesota and Utah) follow the same taxation rules as the federal government. So if you live in one of those two states then you will pay the state’s regular income tax rates on all of your taxable benefits (that is, up to 85% of your benefits).The other states also follow the federal rules but offer deductions or exemptions based on your age or income. So in those nine states, you likely won’t pay tax on the full taxable amount.The other 38 states (plus Washington, D.C.) do not tax Social Security income.State Taxes on Social Security BenefitsTaxed According to Federal Rules: Minnesota, UtahPartially Taxed (Exemptions for Income and Age): Colorado, Connecticut, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Vermont, West VirginiaNo State Tax on Social Security Benefits: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, WyomingDon't miss out on news that could impact your finances.

But consider that if you have enough retirement income that you're paying taxes on Social Security benefits, you're probably in decent shape financially. It means you have income from other sources and you're not entirely dependent on Social Security to meet living expenses.You can also save on your taxes in retirement simply by having a plan. Help yourself get ready for retirement by working with a financial advisor to create a financial plan.Financial advisors can offer valuable guidance and insight into retiree taxes. Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard. Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard.

It seems like investors are buying REITs with ultra-high dividends, believing that a lower interest rate environment will take care of whatever problems these REITs have, generating appreciation as well as a high dividend yield over the next year.Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here are 3 high-yield investments to add significant income to your portfolio.Take a look at three low-priced REITs that could benefit from the lower interest rate environment, while paying dividends with high yields.Office Properties Income Trust (NASDAQ:OPI) is a Newton, Massachusetts-based office REIT with 154 properties covering 20.7 million square feet. As of the third quarter, its occupancy rate was 89.9%. Office Properties is externally managed by the RMR Group Inc. (NASDAQ:RMR).In September, after a great deal of opposition from shareholders, Office Properties Income Trust agreed to terminate its merger proposed in April with RMR Group-managed Diversified Healthcare Trust (NASDAQ:DHC). Since then, that announcement has had a beneficial effect on the share price of Office Properties.On Nov. 17, Office Properties announced that Christopher Bilotto would be taking over as president and CEO of Diversified Healthcare Trust on Jan. 1. Yael Duffy will be appointed president and chief operating officer of Office Properties, also as of the start of the new year.On Dec. 12, the day before the Federal Reserve announcement, Office Properties closed at $5.91. Its most recent close was $6.88 for a gain of 16.4%. Over the past month, it's gained 37.32%.Its present dividend yield is 14.53%, but that's down from over 23% a few weeks ago. The payout ratio is 23.8%, but with $2.57 billion in debt and an operating cash flow of $109 million, a dividend cut is possible in the future. As recently as April, Office Properties cut its quarterly dividend from $0.55 to $0.25 per share. Its last $0.25 quarterly dividend was announced in October and paid on Nov. 16.Service Properties Trust (NASDAQ:SVC) is a Newton, Massachusetts-based diversified REIT with a portfolio of 221 hotels and 761 service-focused net lease retail outlets that cover 46 states, Puerto Rico and Canada. Service Properties owns many of the travel centers along major U.S. highways. Service Properties is also externally managed by the RMR Group.On Nov. 6, Service Properties Trust announced its third-quarter operating results. Funds from operations (FFO) of $0.56 per share beat the estimates of $0.54 as well as its FFO of $0.54 in the third quarter of 2022. Revenue of $496.82 million beat the estimate of $489.19 million but was a slight decrease from revenue of $498.25 million in the third quarter of 2022.Wall Street was unimpressed. One of the problems is that Service Properties is carrying $5.72 billion in high-interest debt, with an 83% debt ratio twice the average of its hotel REIT peers and 2.5 times the average of net lease REITs.On Nov. 13, Wells Fargo Securities analyst Dori Kesten maintained an Underweight rating on Service Properties and lowered the price target from $8 to $6.50.However, the Fed announcement this month was a boon to Service Properties, as it may be able to refinance much of its debt at lower rates next year. Before the announcement, it closed at $7.90 but blasted up to $8.60 within three days before pulling back to $8.33. Shares are 21.7% higher since the Nov. 13 low of $6.84.Service Properties Trust has a present yield of 9.6% and a modest forward payout ratio of 46.5%. Despite the low payout ratio, the dividend could at some point get cut unless Service Properties can refinance its $1.1 billion in debt that matures in 2024.Medical Properties Trust Inc. (NYSE:MPW) is a Birmingham, Alabama-based healthcare REIT that owns and operates 441 general acute care and other properties across the U.S. and in nine other countries, with locations in Europe and even Australia. General acute care hospitals account for 63.7% of its portfolio, which is valued at $19 billion. About two-thirds of its properties are located in the U.S.Few REITs have suffered as much from adverse publicity and shaky finances as Medical Properties Trust in 2022. But it's been on fire lately. Its recent close at $4.85 is 22.4% above the low of  $3.96 on Nov. 13, and it touched a high of $5.76 on Dec. 14 before pulling back.On Nov. 29, JP Morgan analyst Michael Lapides maintained an Underweight position on Medical Properties Trust and slashed the price target by 37.5% from $8 to $5.Like the REITs mentioned above, Medical Properties Trust will need to refinance its heavy debt load. Its yield of 12.37% seems safe enough, as the forward payout ratio is only 38.21%. Lower interest rates will assist this REIT in 2024.Keep in mind that the short interest on Medical Properties Trust is high at 23%.All three REITs are quite volatile and may not be well-suited for more conservative investors.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it's too late.

A group of seven megacap technology companies known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" have been the driving force behind the index's red-hot run in 2023.The Magnificent Seven group is made up of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Microsoft, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla. These Magnificent Seven stocks delivered handsome gains to investors this year, driven mainly by the growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in various industries.Two of them, however, outperformed the rest by a wide margin. These two names are Nvidia and Meta Platforms. While Nvidia's AI-charged run sent the stock up a whopping 239% in 2023, Meta stock surged an impressive 191%, thanks to a solid turnaround in its business. The good part is that these two companies look set to deliver another solid year in 2024.Let's look at the reasons why Nvidia and Meta could soar higher in the new year, and also see why investors would do well to buy these two stocks right away.Investors can rightly point out that Nvidia is trading at a lofty valuation following its surge this year. After all, the stock has a price-to-sales ratio of 27 and trailing earnings multiple of 65.But the pace at which the company grew this year justifies the rich valuation. This is evident from the chart, which shows that Nvidia's revenue has grown at a faster pace than its sales multiple.Similarly, Nvidia's bottom-line growth has also been way faster than the increment in its earnings multiple.Not surprisingly, Nvidia stock is still considered cheap according to Wall Street analysts, especially considering that its forward earnings multiple is lower than other chipmakers, such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices.Buying Nvidia at its current valuation looks like a no-brainer, as the company is likely to deliver much stronger earnings growth than what consensus estimates predict. The semiconductor giant is expected to finish the current fiscal year with adjusted earnings of $11.28 per share, which would be a 237% increase over fiscal 2023. Analysts forecast a 67% increase in Nvidia's earnings in fiscal 2025 (which will begin in February 2024) to $18.81 per share.However, in the past month, 44 analysts covering Nvidia stock have raised their earnings expectations for fiscal 2025. Just three months ago, Nvidia was expected to deliver $16.71 per share in earnings for the next fiscal year. It won't be surprising to see analysts raise their earnings expectations from Nvidia further, given that it is taking steps to tighten its grip over the AI chip market.The company has lined up two powerful AI chips for release in 2024. The GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip is set to hit the market in the second quarter of next year. This chip platform combines Nvidia's Grace central processing unit (CPU) with the Hopper H100 GPU (graphics processing unit) and is also equipped with the latest generation of high-bandwidth memory. Nvidia points out that this chip platform will allow customers to train significantly bigger large language models (LLMs) and could help it maintain its lead over rivals.Also, Nvidia will release the H200 AI GPU in 2024. The company has received orders for this chip already, with major cloud service providers set to deploy it next year. These new chips could boost Nvidia's already-impressive pricing power, as they are upgrades over the current flagship, the H100, which reportedly carries an average price of $30,000. At the same time, Nvidia could witness a sharp increase in shipment volumes of its AI graphics cards next year, as the company is busy ramping up supply.In simpler words, an uptick in unit sales and a potential jump in the average selling price could help Nvidia deliver much stronger earnings growth next year than what consensus estimates forecast. As a result, there is a good chance that Nvidia stock could keep rising in 2024 and deliver market-beating returns once again, which is why investors should look past its valuation and consider buying it before it heads higher.Meta Platforms' eye-popping stock market surge is primarily a result of the solid growth the company has been delivering this year. In the third quarter, Meta's revenue increased 23% year over year to $34 billion, while earnings increased at a faster pace of 168% over the year-ago period to $4.39 per share.Analysts forecast the company's 2023 revenue will increase 5% to $122.6 billion, followed by a stronger jump of 13% next year. This acceleration can be attributed to an improvement in digital ad spending next year, as well as Meta's focus on integrating more AI-enabled features into its social platforms to gain a bigger share of this market.Global digital ad spending is expected to increase by 9% in 2024 to $740 billion. The company recently pointed out that it is testing over 20 ways to improve user experiences on Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp with the help of generative AI.This is in addition to the generative AI-powered features the company launched in October this year to help advertisers create images and backgrounds, as well as multiple copies of ads with varying texts. Meta will also help advertisers improve ad performance by helping them understand which variation of their ads is driving a better response. The company points out that these features will also help advertisers save at least five hours a week, as they will be able to delegate certain tasks to AI.Given that the adoption of AI in the digital marketing space is anticipated to grow at an annual pace of 26% through 2030, Meta's strategy of integrating AI-powered features is likely to bear fruit in the long run. As such, it is not surprising to see that analysts anticipate a nice jump in the company's earnings in 2024.What's more, Meta's earnings could increase at an annual rate of almost 30% for the next five years. That would be a nice jump over the 8% annual earnings growth it clocked in the past five years. The market could reward Meta's improved earnings power with further solid stock price gains.That's why investors would do well to buy this tech stock right now, as it is trading at 24 times forward earnings, a discount to the Nasdaq-100 index's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 28.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

(AP) — Deposition testimony from billionaire Jimmy Haslam supports claims by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathway that Haslam tried to bribe employees at the Pilot truck stop chain amid a dispute with Berkshire over the future of the company, a Berkshire attorney told a judge Thursday.In a deposition Tuesday, Haslam denied offering a “side payment” to Pilot Travel Centers controller David Clothier if the Haslam family exercises its right to sell its remaining 20% stake in PTC to Berkshire, attorney Ryan Stottmann told Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn.Just minutes later, however, Haslam testified that he has an informal agreement with two dozen PTC employees to reinstate their lucrative executive bonus plan if the Haslams sell their stake in the company, according to Stottmann.Stottmann described Haslam’s admission as “stunning,” given that attorneys for Haslam’s Pilot Corp. have told the judge that Berkshire’s bribery allegations were false, meritless and “wild inventions.”“Their own client has now confirmed under oath that these were not inventions, but that the shadow executive compensation plan actually exists,” Stottmann said.At a hearing earlier this month, an attorney for Haslam told Zurn that federal prosecutors had begun an investigation based on Berkshire’s bribery allegations.On Thursday, Zurn granted a request by Berkshire to take additional deposition testimony from Haslam after the Cleveland Browns owner was repeatedly instructed by his lawyer during this week’s deposition not to answer questions about the informal compensation agreement.Specifically, Berkshire is seeking the identities of the 24 employees to whom Haslam referred, and the nature of their informal agreements with him, Stottman said.“These matters go directly to witness bias and credibility,” he told Zurn, noting that both Haslam and Clothier will be key witnesses at a two-day trial early next month over PTC’s accounting practices and valuation.Stottman said several documents provided by Clothier will be shown at trial, and that there is evidence that Clothier edited some of them in the midst of the legal battle with Berkshire “in a way favorable to Pilot.” He also noted that Clothier, who will be deposed next week, described himself in a text as one of “Jimmy’s bag boys.”Berton Ashman Jr., an attorney for Pilot Corp. and Haslam, argued that additional testimony from Haslam is not needed, and that Berkshire is trying to obtain information to which it is not entitled.He pointed to earlier rulings by Zurn that barred Berkshire from asserting certain defenses to Pilot’s claims that Berkshire, which owns 80% of PTC, changed accounting practices in order to lower the price Berkshire would have to pay for the rest of the company. Among the defenses that Zurn struck were allegations about side payments, Ashman said.Zurn, however, rejected Pilot’s argument that the information sought by Berkshire is related solely to the defenses and counterclaims it will not be allowed to argue at trial.“Just because those are out of the case doesn’t mean that that information is not relevant in another way,” the judge said. “I think it’s relevant to impeachment and bias.”Zurn also expressed concern about Haslam being told not to answer certain questions during his earlier deposition.“I’ve heard no basis today for the instruction that the witness not answer the question, which in my view is a remarkable thing to happen in a Delaware deposition,” she said.Under an investor rights agreement with Berkshire, the Haslam family, which includes former Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, have an annual option, starting Jan. 1, 2024, to sell their remaining interest in PTC to Berkshire. The Haslams have 60 days from the start of each year to make that decision. With the first sale option deadline nearing, the Haslams and Buffett’s company are accusing each other of manipulating Pilot’s earnings this year to affect the price Berkshire would have to pay for the Haslams’ remaining stake."}

{"date": "2023-12-23-11-29", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/4-rule-retirement-income-may-152732783.html", "text_blocks": "The 4% rule has long provided guidance to retirees on how to maintain a safe withdrawal rate from retirement accounts. But with today’s low bond yields and stock market volatility, this once-steady rule of thumb looks increasingly open to change. A new approach detailed by John Hancock Investment Management suggests using diversified multi-asset income portfolios. The idea is to provide more durable and ample income streams, while better protecting nest eggs through volatile markets.Do you want help building a retirement plan for the future? Speak with a financial advisor today.Multi-asset income portfolios combine a variety of assets with the objective of generating steady cash flows. They typically hold an array of bonds, including government, investment-grade corporate and high-yield issues. They may also include dividend-paying stocks, real estate investment trusts (REITs), master limited partnerships (MLPs) and alternative income generators, like private equity and infrastructure securities.Diversification across many income sources is the hallmark of multi-asset strategies. This aims to deliver higher yields for investors, while controlling for the risk of overexposure to any single asset class or market sector. Portfolios mix higher-risk, higher-yield securities with lower-risk securities to balance pursuing returns and managing risks.Multi-asset income strategies offer ordinary investors, savers and retirees today the opportunity to develop greater resilience to market downturns compared to simply relying on the 4% rule over the long term. This rule of thumb suggests withdrawing 4% of retirement savings the first year of retirement and increasing the withdrawal amount annually by the inflation rate.With long-term bond yields still depressed compared to historical norms, however, a traditional 60/40 stock/bond portfolio may produce overall returns insufficient to support a 4% withdrawal rate. Stock market volatility also adds uncertainty around the idea that 4% will be a safe withdrawal rate for decades into retirement.In contrast, multi-asset income portfolios have delivered steadier payouts and lower volatility through three recent market downturns, according to John Hancock’s report. These include the 2008 financial crisis, the 2020 pandemic-driven selloff and the 2022 stock and bond correction. Investors in these portfolios enjoyed average annual payouts slightly exceeding 4% throughout most of this turbulence, according to an analysis by Manulife Investment Management referenced in the report.Multi-asset income investing isn’t necessarily right for everyone facing retirement. The wide mix of assets across stocks, bonds and alternative investments increases portfolio costs and complexity versus holding just an index fund. It also requires active management of the asset allocation, as market risks shift over time. And yields will fluctuate, so income cannot be guaranteed the way a bond’s coupons promise fixed interest.But for retirees seeking to generate durable cash flow to support their lifestyle, multi-asset income strategies merit consideration. For those uncomfortable with depending on dividend stocks or high-yield bonds alone to fund retirement, multi-asset diversity spreads risk. These portfolios have delivered steady payouts for years according to Manulife Investment Management’s aforementioned data, with likely lower levels of volatility than stocks.Individual investors' income needs, withdrawal rate requirements and risk tolerance all determine whether or not a multi-asset income portfolio would be a good fit. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, the record of resilience through recent stock and bond storms suggests multi-asset funds could be a viable option for many.While multi-asset income portfolios contain risks better than relying on the 4% rule, limitations remain. Income isn’t guaranteed year-to-year, and future returns could fall short of historical averages. Additionally, the variety of securities involved leads to higher management fees than simple index funds, as investors pay for active oversight of these more complex strategies.Finding the right mix of assets that aligns with your income goals and risk tolerance takes guidance. No standard portfolio allocation meets every investor’s needs. And shifting some holdings like private equity or real estate into income-generating assets can take time and involve transactional costs.If you have a questions about how to parse out your money in retirement, a financial advisor can help.
