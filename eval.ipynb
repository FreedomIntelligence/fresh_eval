      "methods used are remote and do not constrain the animal’s motion. In this work, we use data obtained from cheetahs in the wild\n",
      "to present a trajectory optimisation approach for estimating the 3D kinematics and joint torques of subjects remotely. We call\n",
      "this approach kinetic full trajectory estimation (K-FTE) . We validate the method on a dataset comprising synchronised video\n",

      "High-speed manoeuvrability is the \"final frontier\" in the study of legged locomotion. While constant-speed gait has been studied\n",

      "are, however, only able to treat the animal as one lumped rigid body and are thus unable to provide information about leg, spine\n",

      "1 Introduction\n",
      "Survival analysis, also known as time-to-event analysis, aims at estimating the survival distributions of a specific\n",
      "event and time-of-interests. Typically, the estimation of survival probability involves modeling a relationship between\n",
      "covariates and time-to-event that is typically partially observed; e.g., it may not be possible to observe the event status\n",
      "of the same sample. This presents one of the key challenges in the field of survival analysis.\n",
      "The conventional approaches commonly employed in survival analysis include the Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH)\n",
      "model, as proposed by Cox [6]. Although the CPH model is widely used, it is burdened by a substantial assumption of\n",
      "a consistent proportional hazard throughout the entire lifespan and a predetermined relationship between covariates.\n",
      "Other conventional methods, such as Weibull or Log-Normal distribution, also model a relationship between time and\n",
      "covariates based on a strong parametric assumption.\n",
      "Recently, due to the success of DNN-based models, the majority of research in survival analysis has shifted towards\n",
      "models built on DNNs, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional approaches. Recent studies have\n",
      "shown that the majority of the survival models are an extension of the conventional CPH model [28]. It calculates the\n",
      "hazard rate at time tin the form of h(t) =h0(t)eg(x), where eg(x)is a relative risk that depends on covariate vector x\n",
      "such that g(·)is estimated by a neural network. Initial investigations of adopting neural networks in survival analysis\n",
      "date back to 1995 when Faraggi-Simon et al. [8] utilized neural networks to predict individual risk events based on the\n",
      "CPH model assumption. However, this pioneering study failed to show the advantages of using such methods over\n",
      "traditional CPH models. The deep learning-based model with CPH assumption was then improved in DeepSurv [13]\n",
      "using modern deep learning techniques, which shows superior performance over the traditional CPH model. However,\n",
      "this deep learning model still follows the proportional hazards assumption. To overcome this, several approaches\n",
      "have been developed using deep learning. Cox-Time [18] calculates the relative risk function as eg(x,t)to model the\n",
      "interaction between xandt. Therefore, Cox-Time is more flexible and robust than DeepSurv since it does not depend\n",
      "on the CPH assumption, but is still based on the partial likelihood function.\n",
      "Existing studies have developed discrete-time survival models that try to overcome the proportional hazards assumption.\n",
      "These models allow the input data at a predefined specific time only. For instance, Deephit [20] uses a discrete-time\n",
      "likelihood that constructs a PMF of event time using softmax as an output layer of the model. This approach can\n",

      "networks (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2014; Rezende\n",

      "There are two main approaches to diffusion models: denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) (Sohl-\n",
      "Dickstein et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2020) and score-based generative models (Song & Ermon, 2019) (SGMs).\n",
      "The former kind, DDPMs, progressively transform samples from the target distribution into noise through\n",
      "a forward process, and learn a backward process that reverses the transformation and is used to generate\n",
      "new samples. On the other hand, SGMs use score matching techniques (Hyvärinen & Dayan, 2005; Vincent,\n",

      "Although DDPMs and SGMs might seem like different approaches at first, Ho et al. (2020) showed that\n",
      "DDPMs implicitly learn an approximation of the score function and the sampling process resembles Langevin\n",
      "dynamics. Furthermore, Song et al. (2021b) derived a unifying view of both techniques using stochastic\n",

      "  3  Abstract While communication research frequently studies latent message features like moral appeals, their quantification remains a challenge. Conventional human coding struggles with scalability and intercoder reliability. While dictionary-based methods are cost-effective and computationally efficient, they often lack contextual sensitivity and are limited by the vocabularies developed for the original applications. In this paper, we present a novel approach to construct vec-tionary measurement tools that boost validated dictionaries with word embeddings through nonlinear optimization. By harnessing semantic relationships encoded by embeddings, vec-tionaries improve the measurement of latent message features by expanding the applicability of original vocabularies to other contexts. Vec-tionaries can also help extract semantic information from texts, especially those in short format, beyond the original vocabulary of a dictionary. Importantly, a vec-tionary can produce additional metrics to capture the valence and ambivalence of a latent feature beyond its strength in texts. Using moral appeals in COVID-19-related tweets as a case study, we illustrate the steps to construct the moral foundations vec-tionary, showcasing its ability to process posts missed by dictionary methods and to produce measurements better aligned with crowdsourced human assessments. Furthermore, additional metrics from the moral foundations vec-tionary unveiled unique insights that facilitated predicting outcomes such as message retransmission.

However, quantifying latent message features presents a significant challenge.
