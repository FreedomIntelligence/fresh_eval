      "Markovain quantum processes due to the environmental\n",

      "tum process, it can hardly exhibit any non-Markovain\n",
      "features afterward, such as the revival of energy or infor-\n",
      "mation [3, 4]. More intriguing phenomena may emerge\n",
      "when a system consists of a collection of subsystems, such\n",
      "that the properties of its initial state, such as entangle-\n",
      "ment, may signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the future dynamics.\n",
      "A well-known example is the concept of superradiance\n",
      "[5–12] introduced by Dicke in 1954, where the emission\n",
      "intensity from an ensemble of atoms interacting with a\n",

      "with that from independent atoms. It is also well-known\n",
      "that the superradiance behaviors are highly relevant to\n",
      "the initial states of the system. In recent years, super-\n",
      "radiance has received a large amount of attention due\n",
      "to its theoretical signiﬁcance and potential applications\n",
      "[13–29]. Under certain approximations, such as a coarse\n",

      "regarded as Markovian [8–12], whereas, it is intrinsically\n",
      "non-Markovian. With the advances in theories and tech-\n",

      "superradiance becomes more demanding [26–29]. In a\n",
