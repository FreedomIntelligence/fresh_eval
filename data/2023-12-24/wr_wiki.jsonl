The street starts at the Puente Ricardo Palma [es] and continues until it reaches Grau Avenue.\n\nFormerly a street (jirón), it was widened in 1947 under the government of Manuel A. Odría and buildings were built to house the ministries of economy and education. It is currently the second most congested artery in the city due to the circulation of 43 public transportation routes, in addition to private transportation.[1] This makes it one of the roads with the greatest environmental and noise pollution in the city.[2]\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nThe road that today constitutes the street was laid by Francisco Pizarro when he founded the city of Lima on January 18, 1535. In 1862, when a new urban nomenclature was adopted, the road was named jirón Arequipa. Prior to this renaming, each block (cuadra) had a unique name:\n\nBlock 1: Juan de la Coba, after the man of the same name who lived there in the 17th century.[3]\nBlock 2: Trapitos, for reasons not known.[4]\nBlock 3: Compás de la Concepción, after the part of the convent of the same name not yet built, known as a compás.[5]\nBlock 4: Cascarilla, after the antifebrifuge bark of the same name sold by the Jesuits.[6]\nBlock 5: Santa María, after the title of the noble family that lived there.[7]\nBlock 6: Sagástegui, possibly also \"Sagasti\" or \"Zugasti\" after people who possibly lived there.[8]\nBlock 7: Pileta de Santa Teresa, after the church of the same name. The area's appearance was heavily affected by the widening programme.[9]\nBlock 8: Hospicio de Cándamo.[10]\nBlock 9: Zepita.[11]\n\nWith the street widening programme in the 20th century, new blocks were created along the avenue.\n\nWhen the avenue was expanded to the north, through the Convent of San Francisco, the current first block was created.\nWhen the eastern section of Nicolás de Piérola Avenue (known as Colmena Izquierda) was created, Hospicio de Cándamo Street was divided, forming the current block 10 of the avenue.\nSee also[edit]\nHistoric Centre of Lima\nReferences[edit]\n^ Rodríguez, Sabrina (2013-02-21). \"¿Cuáles son las avenidas más saturadas de Lima?\".

This in turn is stored at the main oil depot of the Guinean Petroleum Company located in the administrative and business district of Kaloum in the capital Conakry, before they are distributed by trucks to the rest of the country,[1][2][3][4] making the facility \"strategically very important\".[5]\n\nEvents[edit]\n\nShortly after midnight on 18 December 2023,[2] an explosion broke out at the depot. Authorities said that the explosion was caused by a fire, whose plumes and smoke could be seen miles away.[5] The fire was brought under control later that afternoon.[6]\n\nThe government said that the explosion and fire rendered at least 13 fuel tanks in the depot out of service, while five others were unaffected.[7] The explosion also caused damage to buildings within at least a one kilometre-radius, which included broken windows in the port area of Conakry[6] and significant material and economic damage in Kaloum.[8] The central prison of Conakry in the Coronthie neighborhood was also heavily damaged, and 33 of its occupants were injured, four of them severely.[8] At least 738 households were affected by the disaster.[9]\n\nAt least 23 people were reported to have died in the explosion and fire, while 241 others were injured.[1] Eight of the dead were described as being in charred condition.[5] At least one casualty was reported to have been killed by debris flung by the explosion.[7] By 19 December, 127 of the injured had been sent home, while 85 others remained in hospital, four of them in a serious condition.[8]\n\nResponse[edit]\n\nThe government ordered the evacuation of residents in the area[5] as well as the closure of schools. It also advised workers to stay home. Several tanker trucks were moved out of the depot under police and military escort as the fire continued.[2] The entire Kaloum district was sealed off except for essential services.[4] A crisis unit led by Prime Minister Bernard Goumou was established to deal with the disaster.[5]\n\nThe Senegalese defence ministry said it had sent a rescue team that included 15 military doctors and eight firefighting specialists to the scene on 18 December, while the French foreign ministry announced the arrival of an assistance and support team. The United Nations provided tents, water tanks, mobile toilets, medicines and other essential supplies.[6] Mali also sent an emergency team to the site.[9]\n\nAftermath[edit]\n\nFollowing the explosion, the government announced the suspension of fuel distribution across the country, leading to the closure of service stations and rioting by youths, who are mostly employed as motorcycle taxi drivers and clashes with the security forces. By 21 December, the distribution of diesel had resumed, while petrol, which is more commonly used in the country, remained suspended.[1] In Mamou, 260 kilometers from Conakry, gas stations were besieged by residents, with a motorcycle taxi driver complaining that the price of a liter of gasoline had risen from 12,000 Guinean francs to 20,000 Guinean francs ($2.35) on the black market.[10] In Conakry, the cost of travelling between the city center from the suburbs was reported to have risen from $5 to $32, while the value of the Guinean franc dropped sharply on the black market.[9]\n\nThe country's military leader, Colonel Mamady Doumbouya, called on citizens \"to show solidarity and pray\".[3] He later ordered three days of national mourning beginning on 21 December.[1] The government also opened an investigation as to the cause of the disaster.[6] The Attorney-General's office said it was looking into an alleged \"willful arson\" regarding the incident.[8]\n\nReactions[edit]\n\nPresident of the African Union Commission Moussa Faki Mahamat expressed condolences to the victims. ECOWAS called on member countries and the international community to provide support to Guinea.[8] Pope Francis expressed his closeness to the families of the victims in his weekly general audience on 20 December.[11]\n\nAmnesty International and other human rights groups voiced concern about restrictions imposed against some privately-owned media and social media applications during the disaster.[1]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\tGuinea portal\nList of building or structure fires\nList of explosions\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d e f \"Clashes in Guinea over fuel supply after oil depot blast kills at least 23\".

{"date": "2023-12-24-13-49", "error": false, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallocentrism", "text_blocks": "Gallocentrism refers to an ethnocentric ideology that places a strong emphasis on the cultural, economical, historical, political and social significance of Gaul, often associated with historical region inhabited by the Celtic tribes before the Roman conquest in Western Europe. Proponents of Gallocentrism advocate for the preservation and celebration of Gallic heritage, viewing it as a crucial component of regional identity.\n\nOriginating from the Latin term Gallia, which historically encompassed parts of modern-day Belgium, Brittany, France, Luxembourg, and Switzerland, Gallocentrism promotes the idea that these regions should prioritize the preservation of their cultural roots. Advocates often emphasize Gallophone heritage, historical achievements, and traditional values associated with the Gallic past. Gallocentrism encompasses various aspects of life, including language preservation, folklore, and community identity.\n\nCritics argue that Gallocentrism can sometimes be linked to exclusionary sentiments, as it may downplay the multicultural aspects of contemporary societies. Additionally, concerns have been raised about the potential for Gallocentrism to oversimplify complex historical narratives and contribute to divisive attitudes.\n\nWhile Gallocentrism has found resonance among those seeking a stronger connection to regional history, it remains a subject of ongoing debate and discussion. The ideology intersects with broader conversations about nationalism, cultural identity, and the interpretation of historical events in the modern era.[1][2][3][4][5][6]\n\nHistorical Context[edit]\nCeltic Gaul[edit]\n\nGaul, during ancient times, was inhabited by Celtic tribes with a rich cultural tapestry. The region played a crucial role in shaping European history, witnessing events such as the Gallic Wars led by Julius Caesar in the 1st century BCE.\n\nRoman Influence[edit]\n\nFollowing the Roman conquest, Gaul became a significant part of the Roman Empire, contributing to the amalgamation of Celtic and Roman cultures. This period laid the foundation for the unique historical and cultural legacy associated with Gaul.\n\nMiddle Ages[edit]\n\nGallocentrism has historical roots dating back to the Middle Ages when the Gallo language flourished as a distinct linguistic entity. Over the centuries, the language faced challenges from various external influences, including political shifts and linguistic assimilation. The modern Gallocentrism movement can be seen as a response to these challenges, aiming to revitalize and safeguard the unique cultural and linguistic aspects associated with Gallo.\n\nCultural Significance[edit]\nLiterature and Arts[edit]\n\nGallocentrism manifests in literature and the arts through works that explore Gaul's history and mythology. Authors and artists draw inspiration from Gallic themes to evoke a sense of historical continuity and cultural pride.\n\nNationalism[edit]\n\nIn some instances, Gallocentrism is associated with nationalist sentiments, emphasizing the uniqueness of Gallic heritage within the broader European context. This perspective can be observed in political discourse and movements that aim to preserve and celebrate Gallic traditions.\n\nContemporary world[edit]\n\nGallocentrism serves as a cultural and linguistic revitalization movement. Advocates work towards raising awareness about the importance of preserving the Gallo language, fostering a sense of pride in regional identity, and ensuring the continuity of traditional practices.\n\nCriticism and Controversies[edit]\n\nWhile some view Gallocentrism as a legitimate exploration of cultural roots and a positive force for cultural preservation, others criticize it for potential historical inaccuracies or for being a tool of nationalist agendas. Critics argue that an exclusive focus on Gaul may oversimplify the complex interplay of cultures in Europe and might lead to exclusionary practices or isolationism. Additionally, there may be concerns about the potential politicization of the movement.\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ Smith, John. Gaul Revisited: Unraveling the Threads of European Heritage.

Scranton\n\nEwha Haktang (이화학당, 梨花學堂, Lihua Hakdang) is a Korean secondary education institution established in 1886 in Hansung-bu, Joseon, and is one of the earliest women's education institutions in Korea. The school name Ewha comes from Ewha Haktang and is the forerunner of Ewha Womans' University and Ewha Girls' High School. It is also the alma mater of independence activist Yu Gwan-sun.\n\nHistory[edit]\nFoundation[edit]\n\t\nThis section contains too many or overly lengthy quotations. Please help summarize the quotations. Consider transferring direct quotations to Wikiquote or excerpts to Wikisource.\n\nIn 1886, a Korean tile-roofed house with a floor space of 200 pyeong was built in Jeong-dong, Seoul, and this is the beginning of teacher construction. It could accommodate about 35 students, and it was equipped with classrooms and teacher accommodations. The number of students increased to 7 in 1887, to 18 in 1888, and to 30 in 1893. As the number of students increased, the existing hanok teacher was demolished in 1897, and the main hall, a two-story Western-style building equipped with the latest facilities at the time, was constructed on the spot. The middle school was established in 1904, the ordinary and high school general departments in 1908, and the university department in 1910. In 1914, Ewha Kindergarten was established and the university had one graduation ceremony.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1915, the kindergarten teachers' department was established, and Simpson Hall was completed. In 1917, the name of the secondary school department was changed to the university preparatory department. Ewha Hakdang separated the high school department and the general department from Ewha Hakdang in 1918 and opened as Ewha Womans High School and Ewha Womans University School, respectively. In 1925, after changing the name of the university department and the university preparatory department to Ewha Womans University, the liberal arts and music department was newly established. The first graduation ceremony of Ewha Womans University was held in 1927, and the following year, in 1928, the kindergarten teachers' department of Ewha Hakdang was renamed Ewha Nursery School. Due to such a change in the school's educational system, the name of Ewha Hakdang was no longer used from 1928. [1]\n\nEwha Hakdang was founded in 1886 in Jeong-dong, Jung-gu, Seoul. Mary F. Scranton, a female missionary from the Methodism, the founder of Ewha Hakdang, is the mother of William Scranton. The school's name was given to King Gojong of the Korean Empire and was Korea's first private female education institution.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1904, the secondary school was established. High school courses were added in 1908, and university courses were added in 1910. First graduates of secondary school were graduated in 1908, and first graduates of university courses were graduated in 1914.[2][3]\n\nArchitecture of the main hall of Ewha Hakdang[edit]\n\nThe main hall of Ewha Hakdang was built by Shim Eui-seok, a famous architect at the time, from 1897 to 1899.[4]\n\nGrowth[edit]\n\nIn 1918, the general department was divided into Ewha Girls' High School and the high school department was divided into Ewha Womans University. The university department was promoted to a vocational school in 1925 and opened as Ewha Womans University. In 1928, the last remaining kindergarten curriculum was independent as Ewha Nursery School, and the name of Ewha Hakdang disappeared as schools at all levels were operated under an independent system.[2]\n\nSubject[edit]\n\nIt was initially troubled by the Korean traditional notion of avoiding women's education and the exclusive nature of Westerners. Looking at the initial situation, Mrs. Scranton was pointed out as a \"Western goblin\", and the first student was a female student who had cholera. And in 1887, it was very difficult to find students, with the number of students increasing to only seven. As for the purpose of education at Ewha Hakdang, Gilmore pointed out, \"It is to make Korean girls an exemplary housewife and to make Protestant missionaries among their relatives and colleagues.\" Since the school was established by Protestantism, the Bible is the most important as a subject, and Mrs.Scranton also taught English, English Grammer, English Literature, Mathmatics, Hangul, Music, History, and Writing, as well as Chinese characters. In other words, she taught subjects that can be applied in real life.[2]\n\na wedding and a graduation ceremony[edit]\n\nPrior to 1908, there was no graduation ceremony, but most of them quit their studies by getting married.[5]he elderly female student's wedding was thus assisted by missionaries. The missionary served as the girl's guardian to save the groom and pay for the wedding.\n\nAmong the weddings arranged by a missionary at Ewha Hakdang, Korea's first Western-style wedding was held on April 18, 1897, with groom Cho Man-soo and bride Kim Ryun-si. Born in 1879, Kim Ryun-si was a student who attended Ewha Hakdang for nine years, and Cho Man-soo was born in Gwacheon on January 1, 1876 and came to Seoul at the age of 17 to teach the Korean language for Josephine Ophelia Payne, the current teacher of Ewha Hakdang.[2]\n\nSee Also[edit]\nEwha Girls High School\nEwha Women's University\nEncyclopedia of Korean Culture - Ewha Hakdang\nReferences[edit]\n^ <University Dictionary>, Ewha Hakdang, Good Morning Media\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d 《Encyclopedia of Korean Culture》, Ewha Hakdang, Academy of Korean Studies\n^ 「Ewha, 110 Years of History」, the new construction and extension of a building, Ewha Womans Universtity Museum, Ewha Womans University press(2007, 194~197p)\n^ Encyclopedia of Korean Culture - Shim Eui Seok\n^ Kim, Eun Shin (1995). 이것이 한국 최초.

the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 established the Waitangi Tribunal with responsibility for investigations of grievances leading to recommendations for resolution; in 1985, a change in the law expanded its coverage from its inception in 1975 backward to 1840 when the Treaty was signed.[6][7] That expansion meant far more research covering a much greater period of time than originally envisioned, leading the government to establish the Treaty of Waitangi Policy Unit.\n\nTreaty of Waitangi Policy Unit (TOWPU)[edit]\n\nHill worked as an archivist at the National Archives (now Archives New Zealand Te Rua Mahara o te Kāwanatanga) in Wellington before joining the Justice Department[1] to work as \"one of the foundation members--and the inaugural Chief Historian/Chief Analyst--of the Treaty of Waitangi Policy Unit.\"[3]\n\nIn “Settling Historical Māori Claims under the Treaty of Waitangi: An Assessment of the First Twenty-Five years, 1989-2014,” Hill writes from his perspective as a participant: Hired in 1989 for a policy-analysis position, he was then appointed as the \"sole historian in a small policy-advice unit\"--TOWPU.[2] Because the then Labour Government wanted to expedite negotiations between the Crown and Māori over disputed assets, TOWPU moved from “investigating how to proceed with negotiations with tribes claiming breaches of the Treaty, and beginning experimental negotiations with a large tribal grouping,” and then negotiations began \"to dominate the work of the unit.\"[2]\n\nAs a Senior Negotiator working for TOWPU, Hill was involved in the earliest, ground-breaking negotiations, particularly those involving Waikato-Tainui in the North Island and Ngai Tahu in the South Island.[8]\n\nWaitangi Tribunal[edit]\n\nAs Hill himself notes, \"Very few of those who enter directly into Treaty negotiations on the Crown side later move to the Waitangi Tribunal section.\"[2] Yet in 2008, while a professor at Victoria University of Wellington's Stout Research Centre, Hill was appointed to the Waitangi Tribunal.[3] He was reappointed in 2011.[9]\n\nAlong with Professor Ranginui Walker (Whakatōhea), Professor Hill was part of the inquiry panel for the Wai 1040: Te Paparahi o te raki hearing, which presented its Stage 1 report to the Crown in 2014.[10] This report dealing with Ngāpuhi claimants based in Northland \"differs considerably from the tenor and content of most of the Tribunal’s historical claims reports\" because it is \"‘a contextual report, not a report into claims’ (at 1.4.1),\" leading to its \"findings on he Whakaputanga,\" a response by rangatira to a perceived threat to their authority.[11] As Hill notes in \"Settling Historical Māori Claims,\" the report's conclusion marks significant changes since 1975: As the current iteration of the Justice Department's website for the Waitangi Tribunal says, the Tribunal's “exclusive authority to determine the meaning and effect of the Treaty” as well as the power to “decide on issues raised by the differences between the Māori and English Texts of the Treaty”[12] is now secure even when it goes against the government's political wishes.[2]\n\nEducation and academic career[edit]\n\nHill received his D.Litt from the University of Canterbury.[4] He was awarded a Commonwealth Scholarship in 1972[13] and is a university fellow at the University of Cambridge (England).[1]\n\nStout Research Centre[edit]\n\nProfessor Hill's teaching interests mirror his research interests: 19th century New Zealand history, the history of policing and social control as well security and intelligence both within Aotearoa New Zealand as well as internationally, Te Tiriti o Waitangi and Crown Māori relations generally, and the history of the New Zealand labour movement.[14]\n\nWhen Hill joined the Stout Centre, he founded the Centre's Treaty of Waitangi Research Unit (TOWRU), which he managed from 2000-2020.[4] TOWRU produces \"reports for government, iwi and judicial and other agencies\" involved in the ongoing reconciliation process.[4]\n\nHill became the Professor of New Zealand Studies at the Stout Research Centre in 2006 and remained in that position until he retired in 2020, and is now Emeritus Professor and Honorary Adjunct Professor.[4][15] He continues as a Postgraduate Supervisor and as general editor of the Stout Research Centre's online Treaty Research Series as well as the Security and Surveillance History series.[16]\n\nPublications[edit]\n\n\"One of the strengths of Richard Hill's work at large,\" per one reviewer, is his ability to draw \"apt continuities\" between 19th and 20th events in Aotearoa New Zealand.[5]\n\nThe history of policing in New Zealand[edit]\n\n\"Richard Hill established himself as one of New Zealand's most rigorous historians with his multi-volume study of the history of policing in New Zealand.\"[5] A selected list of Hill's publications can be found here.* [1]\n\n^ a b c \"Hill, Richard Stephen (Dr), 1949-\".

He specialized in Eastern Christianity and oriental studies, including documents in Ethiopian; Syriac and Aramaic; and Arabic.\n\nBiography[edit]\n\nHugo Duensing was born in Hanover, then part of the German Empire, on 15 April 1877 to his parents Friedrich and Henriette. In Hanover, he attended the Kaiser Wilhelm Gymnasium [de]. In 1896, he attended the University of Greifswald, where he studied theology and the Arabic and Ethiopian languages. He traveled to Berlin and later to the Georg August University of Göttingen where he completed his studies under Julius Wellhausen. On August 6, 1906, he acquired a degree in theology from Göttingen. He was ordained a pastor in 1907, and served from 1907 to 1909 in Bad Rehburg; from 1909 to 1926 in Dassensen [de]-Wellersen; and from 1926 until his retirement in 1947 in Goslar at the Market Church St. Cosmas and Damian. In April 1909, he married Anna Schürer, the daughter of the famous historian Emil Schürer. The couple would have five children together: Friedrich, Ernst, Reinhard, Hildegard, and Gertrud. Duensing suffered from occasional spates of ill health and exhaustion, and committed himself to a sanitarium for rest in 1905, 1914, 1920, 1928, and 1936.[1]\n\nFrom January to May 1914, Duensing visited Jerusalem (then under control of the Ottoman Empire) and took pictures of manuscripts held by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem which would be used by the Gottingen Septuagint Company. Some of these photographs would be used to help make Alfred Rahlfs' edition of the Septuagint. While he never achieved a faculty position, he remained an active scholar, especially in the field of Ethiopian studies. He was given an honorary doctorate by the Theology Faculty of the University of Göttingen in 1951.[1]\n\nDuensing died on 28 November 1961.[1]\n\nSelected works[edit]\nLiefert das äthiopische Synaxar Materialien zur Geschichte Abessiniens?

Arguably their best models ever released, such as the FinePix F31fd, only support xD memory cards, which are now obsolete.\n\nRationale for criteria[edit]\nFixed lens[edit]\n\nAlthough the term “digicam” originated as a simple abbreviation for “digital camera”, it is now used specifically to refer to old fixed-lens digital cameras, excluding DSLR-style bridge cameras. Therefore, “best digicams” may subjectively refer to a set of discontinued “high-end point-and-shoots” or “premium compact cameras”.\n\n1/1.7″ CCD sensors or larger[edit]\n\nCMOS sensors have entirely replaced CCD sensors in recent consumer digital cameras due to cost effectiveness and high ISO performance. However, in good lighting conditions, many people find that the CCD sensors in digicams yield a more pleasing color rendition than CMOS sensors. Some liken CCD to slide film (also known as positive film) and CMOS to negative film.\n\nSensor size is correlated with image quality but is only one of many factors that affect it. While there were larger CCD sensors made for interchangeable-lens cameras, such as the Leica M9, CCD sensors in fixed-lens cameras maxed out at 2/3″ (1/1.5″). Premium compact cameras of the time contained sensors around 1/1.7″ in size, whereas entry-level models used 1/2.3″ sensors or smaller.\n\nSDHC and SDXC cards[edit]\n\nEarly digital cameras used a variety of formats for storage. Eventually SD cards won the format war, and they are still widely used and readily available. However, the original SD format maxes out at 2GB and is now rare. Cards today far exceed that by using one of two format extensions: SDHC, which maxes out at 32 GB, or SDXC, which maxes out at 2 TB. SDXC support is more future-proof, but SDHC cards are still common and inexpensive.\n\nRaw image format[edit]\n\nWhile the appeal of digicams stems from the ability of obtain pleasing results with a nostalgic look straight out of camera, capturing in a raw format maximizes the ability to edit an image to one’s taste or recover details (such as highlights and shadows) that might otherwise be lost in the JPEG version, especially given the low dynamic range of these small-sensor cameras.\n\nAA or AAA batteries[edit]\n\nNew consumer digital cameras with CCD sensors stopped being released in the early 2010’s, and the few that offered USB charging only supported it via a non-standard cable. Proprietary cables, chargers, and batteries can be difficult to come by, especially when discontinued, which makes support for standard AA or AAA batteries (especially rechargeable NiMH cells) an appealing feature.\n\nEven larger CCD sensors[edit]\n\nThe following digicams include a 2/3″ CCD sensor, a fixed lens with a maximum aperture of f/2.4 or wider, and SD or CompactFlash (CF) memory card slots. However none of them support SDXC or even SDHC memory cards.\n\nModel\tSensor\nsize\tOptical\nzoom\tFocal length[a]\tAperture\tPixel\ncount\tSD\tCF\tRaw\tAA/\nAAA\tRelease\nyear\nWide\tTele\tWide\tTele\nLeica Digilux 2\t2/3″\t3.2×\t28mm\t90mm\tf/2.0\tf/2.4\t5 MP\tYes\tNo\tYes\tNo\t2004\nPanasonic Lumix LC1\t2/3″\t3.2×\t28mm\t90mm\tf/2.0\tf/2.4\t5 MP\tYes\tNo\tYes\tNo\t2004\nSamsung Pro815\t2/3″\t15.0×\t28mm\t420mm\tf/2.2\tf/4.6\t8 MP\tNo\tYes\tYes\tNo\t2005\nSony Cyber-shot F828\t2/3″\t7.1×\t28mm\t200mm\tf/2.0\tf/2.8\t8 MP\tNo\tYes\tYes\tNo\t2003\nCanon Powershot Pro1\t2/3″\t7.1×\t28mm\t200mm\tf/2.4\tf/3.5\t8 MP\tNo\tYes\tYes\tNo\t2004\nOlympus C-8080\t2/3″\t5.0×\t28mm\t140mm\tf/2.4\tf/3.5\t8 MP\tNo\tYes\tYes\tNo\t2004\nOlympus E-20\t2/3″\t4.0×\t35mm\t140mm\tf/2.0\tf/2.4\t5 MP\tNo\tYes\tYes\tNo\t2001\nOlympus E-10\t2/3″\t4.0×\t35mm\t140mm\tf/2.0\tf/2.4\t4 MP\tNo\tYes\tYes\tNo\t2000\nSee also[edit]\nList of retro-style digital cameras\nList of large sensor fixed-lens cameras\nNotes[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b 35mm equivalent.\n^ Rebadged by Leica as the D-Lux 5.\n^ Rebadged by Leica as the D-Lux 4.\n^ Rebadged by Leica as the D-Lux 3.\n^ Rebadged by Leica as the D-Lux 2.\n^ Can be powered by 4 AA batteries.[13]\n^ Known as the Samsung EX1 in Europe.\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c Can be powered by 2 AAA batteries.[17]\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"Camera feature search\".

Stalks may be branched or unbranched and up to 5 times the lengths of the cells. The cells themselves are ovoid, 5–42 μm long. They contain a single cell nucleus (i.e. are uninucleate) and contractile vacuoles at their apices. Chloroplasts are one to several, parietal and band-shaped, with or without a pyrenoid.[1]\n\nAsexual reproduction occurs by the formation of zoospores. The zoospores may be released at the apex of the sporangium, and swim until they settle and develop into a new organism; alternatively, they may attach at the base of the sporangium and develop a stalk. Sexual reproduction has not been observed in this genus.[1]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d e f g Guiry, M.D.; Guiry, G.M. \"Chlorangiellaceae\". AlgaeBase.

The street starts at its intersection with the Jirón de la Unión and continues until it reaches the Plaza Ramón Castilla.\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nThe road that today constitutes the street was laid by Francisco Pizarro when he founded the city of Lima on January 18, 1535. In 1862, when a new urban nomenclature was adopted, the road was named jirón Arequipa. Prior to this renaming, each block (cuadra) had a unique name:\n\nBlock 1: Minería, after the Royal Mining Court, established there in 1786.[2]\nBlock 2: Mármol de Carvajal, after Francisco de Carvajal, who lived there, who rebelled against the King of Spain and was ultimately defeated at the Battle of Jaquijahuana. In condemnation of his betrayal, his plot was razed and an infamous marble tombstone was placed.[3] It was later called Calle de los Gallos, the origin of this name being unknown.[4]\nBlock 3: San Marcelo, after the church of the same name.[5]\nBlock 4: Pregonería, after the establishment (a place where public auction sales of both property and merchandise had been carried out since the 16th century) of the same name. The Casa de Beltrán was located here, named after its owner, Pedro Beltrán Espantoso, owner of the disappeared La Prensa. It was the last home to be demolished.[6]\nBlock 5: Patos, for reasons unknown.[7]\nBlock 6: Ranchería del Pato, after the previous block and its rustic homes.[8]\nBlock 7: Pampilla de Leones.[9]\nBlock 8: Huaripampa.\nBlock 9: Minas.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the Palais Concert [es] was located on its first block, a café that brought together among its regulars several figures from the intellectual life of Lima at that time, such as Abraham Valdelomar, José Carlos Mariátegui and César Vallejo.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1970s, during the military government of Juan Velasco Alvarado, a plan was executed that consisted of widening the old Jirón Arequipa, which until then was an old road that preserved its narrow shape since colonial times. In 1971, the controversial widening of the avenue began, demolishing old houses that were located in the northern part of the strip.[10]\n\nSee also[edit]\nHistoric Centre of Lima\nJirón Cuzco\nReferences[edit]\n^ de Reparaz Ruiz, Gonzalo (1974).

{"date": "2023-12-24-13-50", "error": false, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-normal_modal_logic", "text_blocks": "A non-normal modal logic is a variant of modal logic that deviates from the basic principles of normal modal logics. Normal modal logics adhere to the K axiom (\n◻\n(\n𝑝\n→\n𝑞\n)\n→\n◻\n𝑝\n→\n◻\n𝑞\n) and the necessitation principle which states that \"a tautology must be necessarily true\" (\n𝐴\n→\n◻\n𝐴\n). On the other hand, non-normal modal logics do not always have such requirements. The minimal variant of non-normal modal logics is logic E. Axioms M, C and N can be added to the logic system. With all three axioms added to logic E, a logic system equivalent to normal modal logic K is formed. [1]\n\nWhilst Kripke semantics is the most common formal semantics, non-normal modal logics are often interpreted with neighbourhood semantics.\n\nSyntax and Proofs[edit]\n\nThe syntax of non-normal modal logic systems resembles that of normal modal logics. The modalities are most commonly represented with the box (\n◻\n) and the diamond (\n◊\n). For any modal formula \n𝜑\n, the formula \n◊\n𝜑\n is defined by \n¬\n◻\n¬\n𝜑\n. Alternatively, if the language is first defined with the diamond, then the box can be analogously defined by \n◻\n𝜑\n≡\n¬\n◊\n¬\n𝜑\n.\n\nLogic E, the minimal variant of non-normal modal logics, includes the RE congruence rule in its Hilbert calculus or the E rule in its sequent calculus.\n\nHilbert Calculus[edit]\n\nThe Hilbert calculus for logic E is built upon the one for classical propositional logic with the congruence rule (RE): \n𝐴\n↔\n𝐵\n◻\n𝐴\n↔\n◻\n𝐵\n.\n\nLogics containing this rule are called congruential.\n\nSequent Calculus[edit]\n\nThe sequent calculus for logic E, another proof system that operates on sequents, consists of the inference rules for propositional logic and the E rule of inference: \n𝐴\n⊢\n𝐵\n𝐵\n⊢\n𝐴\nΓ\n,\n𝐴\n⊢\n𝐵\n,\nΔ\n.\n\nThe sequent \nΓ\n⊢\nΔ\n means \nΓ\n entails \nΔ\n, with \nΓ\n being the antecedent (a conjunction of formulae as premises) and \nΔ\n being the precedent (a disjunction of formulae as the conclusion).\n\nResolution Calculus[edit]\n\nThe resolution calculus for non-normal modal logics introduces the concept of global and local modalities. The formula \n𝐺\n(\n𝜑\n)\n denotes global modality of the modal formula \n𝜑\n, which means that \n𝜑\n holds true in all worlds in a neighbourhood model. For logic E, the resolution calculus consists of LRES, GRES, G2L, LERES and GERES rules. [2]\n\nThe LRES rule resembles the resolution rule for classical propositional logic, where any propositional literals \n𝑝\n and \n¬\n𝑝\n are eliminated: \n𝐷\n∨\n𝑙\n𝐷\n′\n∨\n¬\n𝑙\n𝐷\n∨\n𝐷\n′\n.\n\nThe LERES rule states that if two propositional names \n𝑝\n and \n𝑝\n′\n are equivalent, then \n◻\n𝑝\n and \n¬\n◻\n𝑝\n′\n can be eliminated. The G2L rule states that any globally true formula is also locally true. The GRES and GERES inference rules, whilst variants of LRES and LERES, apply to formulas featuring the global modality.\n\nGiven any modal formula, the proving process with this resolution calculus is done by recursively renaming a complex modal formula as a propositional name and using the global modality to assert their equivalence.\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ Dalmonte, Tiziano; Negri, Sara; Olivetti, Nicola; Pozzato, Gian Luca (September 2021). \"Theorem Proving for Non-normal Modal Logics\".

The twenty four participating national teams were required to register a squad with a minimum of 23 and a maximum 27 players, an increase of up to 4 players over the regular number of 23 players allowed in the tournament's regulations. Only players in these squads were eligible to take part in the tournament.[1][2]\n\nOn 15 December 2023, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) announced the increase of the maximum number of players included on the final lists from 23 to 27. However, the inclusion of the 4 extra players was optional and not mandatory and teams could still only name a maximum of 23 players on the match list for each tournament fixture (of which twelve were substitutes).[2]\n\nEach national team had to submit a provisional list of up to fifty five players to CAF no later than 14 December 2023. The final list of up to 27 players per national team had to be submitted to CAF General Secretariat by 3 January 2024, ten days before the opening match of the tournament. A player on the submitted final list could only be replaced in the event of serious injury at the latest 24 hours before the beginning of his team's first match of the tournament, provided that it was approved by the CAF Medical Committee.[2]\n\nCAF published the provisional lists on 20 December 2023.[3][4]\n\nThe age listed for each player is on 13 January 2024, the first day of the tournament. The numbers of caps and goals listed for each player do not include any matches played after the start of the tournament.

As Santa Cruz’s most trusted ally in Bolivia, Calvo wielded immense powers in the country. Being Calvo’s secretary, Molina flourished politically during this period, especially during the peak of the Peru–Bolivian Confederation. After the fall of Santa Cruz, he supported the unsuccessful governments of Sebastián Ágreda and Calvo, ultimately becoming an ardent ballivianista after the Battle of Ingavi. Molina was exiled when Eusebio Guilarte was ousted in 1848, spending the rest of his life exiled in Chile.[2] His granddaughter, Carmen Calvo Molina, was married to Daniel Sánchez Bustamante. Through Carmen, he is the great-grandfather of famed Bolivian feminist, María Luisa Sánchez Bustamante. He was married to María del Carmen Frías Ametller, sister of Tomás Frías.\n\nEarly life[edit]\n\nBorn in La Paz, Upper Peru, Viceroyalty of Peru, on March 1, 1808, Molina was the son of Francisco Plácido de Molina and María Ana Gorriti. His father was a supporter of Pedro Domingo Murillo and was forced to flee Upper Peru in 1809. Between 1809 and 1825, Molina lived in Salta alongside his mother’s relatives, the Gorriti family. His uncle was General José Ignacio de Gorriti, father of Juana Manuela Gorriti, First Lady of Bolivia as the wife of Manuel Isidoro Belzu between 1848 and 1855. Francisco died in 1810, when his son was still an infant.[3]\n\nIn 1820, Molina was sent to Buenos Aires to attend boarding school. At time, the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata had already achieved their independence from Spain, meaning that this region was fervently on the side of the patriots. Anti-royalist sentiments were powerful in Buenos Aires, influencing Molina at a young age with ideas of liberalism. In 1825, he aspired to join the army of Antonio José de Sucre and Francisco Burdett O’Conner. They were tasked, by Simón Bolívar, to defeat the remaining forces of Pedro Antonio Olañeta in Upper Peru. However, by the time Molina had reached Salta, Bolivia was proclaimed an independent republic.[4]\n\nTriumphant, the patriots established a newly independent nation named after Bolívar. Molina, an ardent supporter of the cause, chose to abandon his life in Buenos Aires and permanently move to Bolivia. There, he enrolled in the University of San Francisco Xavier, graduating as a lawyer in 1832. That same year, he caught the attention of President Santa Cruz, who had seized power in 1829. In 1833, Santa Cruz appointed Molina as secretary to Mariano Enrique Calvo. Between 1835 and 1839, Calvo served as Vice President of Bolivia. During Santa Cruz’s absence, Calvo was acting president in Bolivia.[5]\n\nBeginning of political career[edit]\n\nIn 1836, Calvo sent Molina along the Bolivian delegation to Lima. Said delegation officially pronounced the Peru–Bolivian Confederation. The same year, Calvo was made division general by supreme decree, angering the Bolivian army. Molina was sent appease the garrison of Tupiza, which had mutinied on December 16, 1836. On January 11 of the next year, Molina arrived in Tupiza. Hoping to appease the mutinous army, he attempted to give a speech at the plaza de armas (the main square) of the city. However, in the middle of his speech, Molina was shot three times. Fortunately for him, the bullets did not penetrate deep enough to constitute a threat to his life.[6]\n\nBy 1839, warring with Argentina and Chile, Santa Cruz had lost the support of most of the elites in Bolivia and Peru. To reassure Santa Cruz, Calvo dispatched Molina to Tacna. There, Molina ensured Santa Cruz that the rebellious General José Miguel de Velasco had been quelled. However, on January 20, 1839, when Santa Cruz clashed with the Chilean army and Peruvian exile militias at the Battle of Yungay, most of the Bolivian high command deserted his side. Velasco, who led the movement, captured Molina, who was present at the battle. Now in power, Velasco carried out a massive purge within the Bolivian army. Some generals he purged included Francisco O’Connor and Otto Philipp Braun. In 1840, Velasco appointed Molina as Prefect of Sucre, although for a very short period as Molina continued conspiring against Velasco and was ultimately exiled that same year.[7]\n\nCongressman and minister of finance[edit]\n\nIn 1841, he returned from exile when Velasco was ousted by a coup led by elite civilians in the country. General Sebastián Ágreda would be appointed president on June 10. However, less than a month later, he himself was forced to resign in favor of Calvo. Appointed as Calvo’s secretary yet again, Molina found the nation on the verge of civil war. Supporters of Ballivián, Velasco, and José Mariano Serrano waged a three-way civil war. By September, it became evident that Agustin Gamarra would launch an invasion of Bolivia. Convincing Calvo and Serrano to side with Ballivián, Molina played a crucial role in preserving Bolivian independence. Velasco, seeing himself outnumbered, too joined the coalition under Ballivián. Molina was present at the Battle of Ingavi on November 18.[8]\n\nAfter Ingavi, Molina officially entered Bolivian politics, being elected on February 19, 1842 to the Chamber of Deputies representing La Paz. During his tenure, he was a staunch ballivianista and adhered solely to the policies of the incumbent President of Bolivia. As a reward for his continued loyalty, Ballivián appointed him Minister of Finance on April 28, 1843.[9] Thus, Molina vacated his position in the Chamber of Deputies. Although a competent statesman, Molina blindly obeyed ballivianista rhetoric, meaning he neglected several aspects of Bolivia’s finances. By the time he left the office to his eventual successor, Tomás Frías, Bolivia’s fiscal matters were in a complete state of chaos. He was appointed again to the Chamber of Deputies, this time representing Oruro, on May 31, 1844.[10]\n\nDownfall and death[edit]\n\nBy late 1847, the partisans of Velasco and Belzu, who was Molina’s first cousin by virtue of his marriage to Juana Manuela Gorriti, launched a revolution that ousted Ballivián. Hoping to maintain his influence, Ballivián appointed Eusebio Guilarte as President. However, within a matter of weeks, Guilarte too was overthrown. Velasco and Belzu would agree to an uneasy alliance which established the former as President. Molina, although a relative of Belzu, was exiled because of his continued loyalty to the ballivianista cause. He would establish himself in Santiago, Chile, where he continued writing pamphlets supporting the return of Ballivián. In 1850, he met with Ballivián in Argentina. There, they discussed a potential invasion from the south, supported by Molina’s family in Salta. However, nothing came of this plan and Ballivián eventually died in 1852.[11]\n\nWith his health deteriorated, perhaps suffering from cancer, Molina retired to private life. He died, away from the public sphere and his homeland on March 22, 1855, aged 47.[12]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ Bolivia (1858).

{"date": "2023-12-24-13-50", "error": false, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinoy_step", "text_blocks": "Pinoy step is a basketball move in which an offensive player picks up their dribble, quickly simulates taking a shot the while going towards the basket then proceeds to make an actual shot with the last remaining legal step. It is intended to allow the ball handler to get past a defender and take a more advantageous shot.[1][2]\n\nBackground[edit]\n\nSome media attribute the move to basketball players in the Philippines. Fans attribute the combination of gather step and pump fake as the Filipino version of Euro step before going airborne. It can be especially effective when a shorter ball handler takes on a taller defender. As a result, the phrase \"Pinoy step\" was given with the first word being the colloquial demonym for Filipinos. Anecdotal reports give credit to Kiefer Ravena and Ricci Rivero for popularizing it.[3][4] In a 2023 SB Nation article, Lucas Kaplan wrote Ravena is \"credited as one of the pioneers of the move, and it's been in his bag since high school,\" adding \"the Pinoy is unmistakably the product of amateur and professional ballers in the Philippines over the past decade.\"[5][6]\n\nNBA players Mikal Bridges, Tyrese Haliburton and Zach LaVine frequently use the ball fake on the move with success.[7]\n\nSee also[edit]\nBasketball moves\nReferences[edit]\n^ Raul Maningat (4 January 2023). \"Pinoy Step in the NBA?\".

It was produced by Luminous Films and licensed to PBS, who first broadcasted it in 2005 and for four consecutive years during the holiday season. The movie was filmed and set in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, a Victorian town in the Ozark Mountains.[1]\n\nThe School Library Journal described the film as a \"holiday classic.\"[1]\n\nPlot[edit]\n\nSet in 1941, the film centers around Joel Carter (Mclean), a print operator, who is unable to afford the bicycle his daughter Carol Lee (Maddox) has asked Santa Claus for as a Christmas gift.[2] The film follows Carter's attempts to acquire a bicycle for Carol Lee. Due to the Great Depression and the onset of World War II, Carter does not receive a holiday bonus and is denied a bank loan as he lacks collateral; therefore Carter is unable to either afford or acquire a bicycle.[2] On the night of Christmas Eve, Carter goes downtown and tries to convince a local shopkeeper to sell him the bicycle on a payment plan, but to no avail.[2] On the walk home, Carter is dejected, but is followed home by a stray dog.[2]\n\nOn Christmas morning, Carol Lee is saddened when she does not receive a bicycle for Christmas.[2] However, her mood improves when she discovers a stray dog outside of the Carter family's door, who she names \"Mr. Christmas\".[2] Initially, Joel's wife, Julia (Little), is tentative about keeping the dog, but eventually agrees much to the joy of the family.[2]\n\nCast[edit]\nJace Mclean as Joel Carter\nJen Celene Little as Julia Carter\nIreland Rose Maddox as Carol Lee Carter\nAbigail Kinslow as Babby Carter\nBill Sims as Bub\nHeather Allmendinger as Marie\nWes Kemp as Paul\nRobert Clark as Santa Claus\nH.T. Jester as Mr. Smith\nDrew Osborn as Mr. Phillips\nDavid Atchison as Johnny\nMurray Atchison as Johnny's mother\nYao Kouakou as Mailman\nProduction[edit]\n\nThe movie was filmed in Eureka Springs, Arkansas in February and March of 2004.[3] The town of Eureka Springs left up all of the Christmas decorations during this period of filming.[1]\n\nOutside of Mclean and Little, all of the film's actors were residents of Arkansas.[1]\n\nAwards[edit]\n\nMr. Christmas won Best Family Film at the Moondance Film Festival and an Award of Excellence from the Film Advisory Board in Los Angeles.[1]\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of Christmas films\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d e Clancy, Sean (2020-12-20). \"PAPER TRAILS: Christmas film offers local touch\".

It begins in the Puente del Ejército [es] and crosses the Plaza Ramón Castilla and Plaza Dos de Mayo, continuing until it reaches the Plaza Bolognesi.\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nThe avenue is located in an area where the Walls of Lima once stood, originally known as the \"Carretera del Gas\" starting in the late 19th century after the gas factory that supplied fuel to the city, located on it. Under Augusto B. Leguía, it was re-inaugurated as the Alameda Circunvalación in 1928.[3]\n\nIn 1965, the covered trench overpass that crosses Plaza Ramón Castilla was built. In the mid-1980s, a road corridor for public transportation similar to the one on Brasil Avenue was implemented, which is currently only preserved in the last block of the avenue. In 1994, the overpass built decades ago was extended to Jirón Quilca, crossing Plaza Dos de Mayo and Jirón Zepita. The road corridor was extended along the underground route and bus stops were implemented, which would later be dismantled to make way for the 2 de Mayo station.\n\nIn 2008, construction of the segregated corridor (COSAC I) and Metropolitano stations began, for which it was necessary to demolish almost the entire old public transportation road corridor and partially modify the structures of the existing overpasses. Since then, conventional transport routes circulate on the mixed road alongside private transport (which increased in 2014 after the implementation of the Blue Corridor), making the avenue one of the most congested in the city.[4]\n\nThe historic neighbourhood of Monserrate is located in the avenue.[5]\n\nSee also[edit]\nHistoric Centre of Lima\nReferences[edit]\n^ Orrego Penagos, Juan Luis (2010-01-22). \"El antiguo nombre de la avenida Alfonso Ugarte\".

This genus ranges across sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nTaxonomy[edit]\n\nThe genus Pogonornis was introduced in 1828 by the Swedish naturalist Gustaf Johan Billberg as a replacement of Pogonias Illiger, 1811, which was already occupied by the fish genus Pogonias Lacépède, 1801. The genus name is from Ancient Greek πωγων/pōgōn meaning beard, and ορνις/ornis meaning bird.[1][2]\n\nThe genus Pogonornis belongs to the order Piciformes, which contains 9 families, including the woodpecker family.[3] A couple of decades ago, all barbets were thought to be of one family, but studies of mitochondrial DNA and DNA hybridization in the early 1990s have led to barbets being split into three families: Asian barbets (Megalaimidae), African barbets (Lybiidae), and American barbets (Capitonidae).[4] The family Lybiidae has a total of 43 species that occur throughout the continent of Africa from the tip of the Cape Peninsula to the fringes of the Sahara desert. Out of the 43 species in this family, Pogonornis contains 5 barbet species. It was previously included in another genus Lybius, which contains only 7 species currently.[5] The 12 species from the two genera are the most frequently encountered group of African barbets.[6]\n\nExtant species[edit]\n\nThe genus contains 5 species:[5]\n\nImage\tCommon Name\tScientific name\tDistribution\n\tBrown-breasted barbet\tLybius melanopterus\tKenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Somalia, and Tanzania.\n\tBlack-backed barbet\tLybius minor\tGabon, Angola, Republic of the Congo and Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\tDouble-toothed barbet\tLybius bidentatus\tAngola, Benin, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, and Uganda.\n\tBearded barbet\tLybius dubius\ttropical west Africa\n\tBlack-breasted barbet\tLybius rolleti\tCentral African Republic, Chad, Sudan, and Uganda.\nReferences[edit]\n^ L.

It starts at the Puente Santa Rosa [es],[1] and continues until it reaches Wilson and La Colmena avenues. It is prolonged to the south for two blocks and to the north until it reaches Rímac Avenue in San Juan de Lurigancho.\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nThe road that today constitutes the street was laid by Francisco Pizarro when he founded the city of Lima on January 18, 1535. In 1862, when a new urban nomenclature was adopted, the road was named jirón Tacna, after the city of the same name.[2] Prior to this renaming, each block (cuadra) had a unique name:\n\nBlock 1: Manita, for reasons not known. According to Ricardo Palma, an waving hand, in reality an optical illusion, guided people there.[3][4]\nBlock 2: Mantequería/Borriqueras, after the lard-selling stores and the donkey stables there, respectively.[5]\nBlock 3: Comesebo, [6]\nBlock 4: Pileta de las Nazarenas, after the fountain formerly located there that belonged to the Sanctuary and Monastery of Las Nazarenas.[7]\nBlock 5: Huevo, for reasons not known.[8]\n\nDuring the 20th century, the road underwent a major renovation after the 1940 Lima earthquake, becoming an avenue.[9] The Sanctuary of Saint Rose of Lima had a section demolished to make way for the renovations in 1959.[10] The nearby Sanctuary and Monastery of Las Nazarenas suffered a similar fate.[11] As a result of the renovations, new highrise buildings started to be built in the avenue. The Gildemeister & Co. building, built in 1928 as the first skyscraper in Lima, paled in comparison to the new construction projects of the post-1940 period.[12] The Edificio Tacna-Colmena is located at the end of the avenue, and takes its name from both avenues.[13]\n\nThe intersection with Emancipación Avenue is the location of the Edificio Oropeza, an incomplete building tha has been abandoned for over three decades.[14][15]\n\nSee also[edit]\nHistoric Centre of Lima\nReferences[edit]\n^ García, Miguel (2022-08-30). \"Santa Rosa de Lima: la historia del estreno del puente al final de la Av.

Located in the northeast of Huangmei County, in the northern part of the Dabie Mountains, it encompasses an area that integrates old, reservoir, and mountain regions.[2] The name \"Tingqian\" originates from the ancient relay station established during the Ming Dynasty. It was named so because \"travelers stopped here to rest before continuing their journey.\" The town's economy is predominantly agriculture-based, with extensive cultivation of blueberries, oil tea, and yellow tea. Additionally, there is development in tourism, forestry, and animal husbandry. It is recognized as a poverty-stricken town at the provincial level in Hubei and serves as one of the border trade \"gateways\" between Hubei and Anhui. The town government is located in Tingqian Village within its boundaries. As of the end of 2018, the town had a total registered population of 29,184.\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nIn 1983, numerous ancient cultural sites were discovered within its territory, dating back to the Neolithic and Shang-Zhou periods.[3]: 321  During the Tang Dynasty, Wang Xianzhi, a leader of a peasant uprising army, stationed himself in Huangmei and was beheaded at the Yuanpei Hill in Tingqian.[4] From the end of the Yuan Dynasty to the twelfth year of the Zhizheng period (1352), a peasant uprising army led by Xu Shouhui was stationed in Tingqian and suffered defeat.[3]: 322  In the fourteenth year of the Hongwu period of the Ming Dynasty (1381), Tingqian Relay Station was established in the area, known as the \"administrative office connecting seven provinces.\" It served as a transportation hub between Hubei and Anhui and is the origin of the name Tingqian Town.[3]: 321 [5] The Tingqian Relay Station was named so because \"travelers stopped there to rest before continuing their journey\".[6] During the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom period, the Taiping Army engaged in battles with the Qing Army in Tingqian.[7]\n\nDuring the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China period, \"Li Jia\" was renamed as a township, and the name \"Tingqian Town\" first appeared. It belonged to Fengyuan Township and governed 28 villages. Another part of the present territorial area of Tingqian belonged to Zhuobi Town in Xincheng Township, with jurisdiction over 25 villages.[8]: 35, 37, 45  During the Republic of China period, Tingqian was once the location of the Huangmei County government. From 1927 to 1931, during the first Chinese Civil War between the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) and the Communist Party of China, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army divided Huangmei into five districts. Tingqian was part of the Eastern District,[9] with the Soviet Office of the Eastern District located within the Dongsheng Wang Temple in Tingqian Street. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the original four townships were transformed into four districts, comprising 38 towns, with Tingqian Town falling under District 3.[3]: 322 [8]: 46  During this period, the Nationalist government frequently suppressed the activities of the Communist Party of China. In 1934 (23th year, according to the calendar of the Republic of China), the Communist Party of China reinstated its organization in Tingqian, Huangmei, sending Zhou Wangsheng and Zhou Liansheng, among others.[10] During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Huangmei County government retained the district system, converting towns into townships. The original 38 towns were reorganized into 23 townships, merging Tingqian Town and Gujiao Town into Tinggu Township.[8]: 45 \n\nFrom August to November 1947, the Second Field Army commanded by Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping advanced into Huangmei after a long march into the Dabie Mountains, establishing the Huangmei County People's Democratic Government.[8]: 47-48 [10]: 125-150  The upper half of Huangmei was divided into six districts, with District 3 being Tingqian.[8]: 47-48  On May 8, 1949, the establishment of the Huanggang region led to the abolition of the administrative division of Huangmei County during the Republic of China era. Five new districts were created, including Tuqiao, and Tingqian Town's jurisdiction belonged to that district. In August 1952, the entire county was restructured into 12 districts based on natural environments, encompassing 163 townships. Tingqian District was first established as District 3, governing 13 townships: Wangjiangshan, Xiaoping, Tingqian, Chenyuan, Tieniu, Laopu, Tafan, Anren, Guyue, Chaixia, Shicang, Liubi, and Jiangpang. However, in the latter part of 1955, Tingqian District was merged back into the Tuqiao District. In April 1958, the five townships of Wangjiang, Liulin, Tieniu, and Shuima were separated from the Tuqiao District, re-establishing Tingqian District. By the end of the year, the entire county underwent collectivization, and Tingqian District was changed to Shangyou People's Commune. In February 1959, it was renamed Tingqian People's Commune based on the geographic location.[11]: 125-150 [12]\n\nIn the reorganization and merger of districts and communes in October 1975, the People's Commune of Tingqian was divided into two communes: one retained the name Tingqian, while a newly established one was called Liulin People's Commune.[11]: 52  The Tingqian People's Commune had jurisdiction over three administrative areas: Tingqian, Liubi, and Shuima, with 19 production brigades, 273 production teams, 1 natural town, and 284 natural villages.[3]: 322  On the other hand, the Liulin People's Commune encompassed three administrative areas: Liulin, Laopu, and Wangjiang, with 14 production brigades, 141 production teams, 142 natural villages, and 1 natural town.[13]\n\nDuring the dissolution and merger of communes in February 1984, the People's Communes were dissolved, and two communes were merged to form the Tingqian District. It had jurisdiction over six townships, a township-level town named Tingqian, 35 villagers' committees, and 330 villagers' groups, totaling 412 natural villages.[11]: 48 [12] In 1987, all 69 townships and township-level towns were abolished, and 12 districts and 6 district-level towns were transformed into 13 townships and 10 towns. Some territory was separated from the Tingqian District to establish Liulin Township, while the remaining area was restructured into Tingqian Town.[8]: 101 [12]\n\nUpon the establishment of Tingqian Town in 1987, it had 21 villagers' committees, 170 villagers' groups, and 1 residents' committee. These committees were named as follows:[8]: 101, 103 \n\nTingqian Village, Jinzhai Village, Sanqupu Village, Hailuoshan Village, Zhoutangan Village, Deng'ao Village, Changchong Village, Shicang Village, Huzhai Village, Caiqiao Village, Meilong Village, Jiangbang Village, Jiangchong Village, Panhe Village, Liubi Village, Tieniu Village, Tongzhai Village, Jieling Village, Chaixia Village, Dongchong Village, Nanchong Village.\n\nSubsequently, some villagers' committees were renamed. As of 2019, Tingqian Town still administers 21 administrative villages, all of which are administrative villages.[14]\n\nEnvironment[edit]\nGeographical location[edit]\n\nTingqian town is situated at the forefront of the Dabie Mountains, historically recognized as a strategic military location.[3]: 322  It is located in the northeast of Huangmei County,[2] bordering Erlang and Fuyu Townships in Susong County, Anhui Province, to the east, adjacent to Shanmu Township to the south, Wuzu Temple to the west, and Liulin Township to the north.[15] The town government is situated at Tingqian Xin Street in Tingqian Village, approximately 170 kilometers from the provincial capital of Wuhan and 18 kilometers from the county seat.[16] Due to its location on the boundary between Hubei and Anhui provinces,[17] Tingqian was identified by the Hubei Provincial Government as one of Hubei's border trade \"gateways\".[18] However, despite this designation, Tingqian faces geographical disadvantages, being far from urban centers and suburban areas.[6]\n\nEnvironment[edit]\nTingqian town\nClimate chart (explanation)\n\nJ\n\t\nF\n\t\nM\n\t\nA\n\t\nM\n\t\nJ\n\t\nJ\n\t\nA\n\t\nS\n\t\nO\n\t\nN\n\t\nD\n\n\n \n \n52\n \n \n10\n0\n\t\n \n \n160\n \n \n13\n5\n\t\n \n \n179\n \n \n17\n6\n\t\n \n \n194\n \n \n23\n13\n\t\n \n \n310\n \n \n27\n15\n\t\n \n \n241\n \n \n27\n20\n\t\n \n \n234\n \n \n29\n25\n\t\n \n \n175\n \n \n29\n23\n\t\n \n \n121\n \n \n27\n20\n\t\n \n \n95\n \n \n25\n15\n\t\n \n \n120\n \n \n16\n9\n\t\n \n \n77\n \n \n11\n1\n\n█ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C\n█ Precipitation totals in mm\nSource: NASA Earth Observations Data Set Index\n\n\nshow\nImperial conversion\n\nThe administrative area of Tingqian Town covers an area of ​​83.27 square kilometers.[19] It is located in the northern part of the Dabie Mountains, serving as a transitional zone between the ancient Jiaoshan Mountain Range and the plain areas.[18] The terrain slopes from north to south,[20] with the western and northern regions bordering the Gujiao Reservoir being more mountainous, classified under the Huaiyang geoplate.[21]: 552  In the eastern part, there are undulating hills interspersed with small patches of fields, presenting a relatively flat topography. The central and southern areas consist of hilly terrains and plain regions.[3]: 322  The highest point within its boundaries is Jishijian Peak (488 meters above sea level), along with other relatively high peaks like Qianjia.[3]: 321  [20] It experiences a subtropical monsoon climate with abundant sunshine and distinct seasons, yet it is moist.[22][23] However, the mountainous regions have lower temperatures, stronger winds, shorter sunlight exposure, and a frost-free period that is 30 to 50 days less than the plain areas, with seasons often delayed by 15 to 30 days.[24] As per the 2016 statistics, the average temperature of the town is 17°C, with July being the warmest month at 27°C, and January being the coolest at 5°C.[25] The average annual rainfall is 1963 millimeters, with May being the wettest month, averaging 310 millimeters, and the driest month is January, receiving 52 millimeters of rainfall.[26]\n\nMost of the area in Tingqian Town is occupied by farmland.[27] The primary soils found in this region are red sandy clay soil (distributed in the high and low hilly areas of Tingqian) and fine red sandy clay soil (found in Liubi, Shuima, and Zhaojiazhuang), followed by tidal sandy soil. There is also a small amount of limestone soil and red wusha sandy soil (found in Liubi and Fengshu'ao). Regarding paddy fields, various types are found, including shallow red fine sandy clay fields (in Liubi and Shuima), shallow red sandy clay fields (on high and low hills in Tingqian), shallow sandy clay fields (on dry mountains ranging from 500 to 800 meters), fine red sandy clay fields (in Liubi, Shuima, etc., on low hills, gullies, mounds, bays, and fields), red wusha sandy clay fields (in the major mountain fault zones of Tingqian, Liubi, and Shuima), red bubble yellow mud fields, sandy mud fields, mountain sandy mud fields, limestone mud fields, tidal mud fields, and cold spring fields.[3]: 321–322 [21]: 98–101  Except for certain areas like Shuima where limestone-developed soil is alkaline, the rest of the soil in the region is mildly acidic or acidic.[21]: 98–99  There are mineral resources such as talcum powder ore, clay ore, mica ore, quartz ore, limestone ore, granite, and feldspar.[20][21]: 103 \n\nThe ancient Jiaoshan Reservoir, located within the area, was built in 1956 and completed the following year. It serves as a medium-sized key reservoir mainly used for flood control and irrigation, supplemented by aquaculture and power generation. The total storage capacity reaches 56.34 million cubic meters, covering a catchment area of 73 square kilometers, with a designed irrigation area of 108,000 mu (around 18,000 acres).[3]: 321–322 [28] The reservoir has two main canals, the East Canal and the West Canal, spanning the entire town. Additionally, there are seven rivers and four small reservoirs within the Tingqian area.[20]\n\nThe town's primary natural resource configuration revolves around \"six mountains, one river, and three portions of farmland\".[29] Tingqian Town strives to develop as an ecological town, with forest coverage exceeding 95%. Over 70% of this forest area is designated as ecological forests, with plans to establish several natural reserves. The harmony between humans and nature, along with the \"continuous pine trees for ten miles\" scene, has been specially featured in the overseas edition of the People's Daily.[30]\n\nEconomy[edit]\n\nTingqian Town is among the 200 provincially supported key poverty-stricken towns designated by the Hubei Provincial People's Government.[31] In 2012, the town's gross domestic product (GDP) reached 1.26 billion yuan, marking a 16.6% year-on-year increase. Fixed asset investment amounted to 170 million yuan, growing by 106.7% year-on-year.[32] In 2015, the total fiscal revenue for the town was 4.703 million yuan.[33]\n\nAgriculture[edit]\nA corner of Dengao Village in Tingqian Town.\n\nAgriculture is the primary driving force of the local economy in Tingqian Town. Most of the arable land is scattered on the high mountains in the northern part of the town, sporadically distributed.[29] Some barren hills are covered with weeds, prompting local villagers to remark \"guarding the green mountains, yet poor as can be\".[34] In the 1980s, the town primarily cultivated rice, sweet potatoes, wheat, and potatoes. Notable local specialties included tea leaves, fava beans, Chinese cabbage, ginger, Shuima red dates, Chaixia honey tangerines, and chestnuts.[3]: 322  The Chaixia honey tangerines gained fame for their sweet taste, while the tea leaves, represented by the Yejiadang Tea Plantation, were well-regarded.[11]: 58–59  Also, in the 1980s, Tingqian Town had an area of more than 30,000 mu (around 2,000 hectares) of arable land, with paddy fields occupying the majority, and a small portion designated for dry farming.[11]: 58–59  By the late 2002, the town had around 12,750 hectares of cultivated land, with a sowing area of 2,925 hectares for crops.[35]\n\nSince the beginning of the 21st century, farming hasn't been able to meet the local residents' needs. In 2017, with the aim of lifting villagers out of poverty, Tingqian Town set the development goal of becoming a key oil-tea town and creating a blueberry hub. The local government divided the entire town into three functional areas. Specifically, in the eastern part of Tingqian Town, the blueberry industry is being developed, while in the central and western areas, the focus is on the oil-tea industry, creating an \"ecological conservation and development zone\". To elaborate, the town aims to construct a 10,000-mu blueberry base centered in Tongzhai Village, establish a 20,000-mu oil-tea base centered in Liubi Village, and create an 8,000-mu yellow tea base centered in Haishan and Jiangchong Villages.[2][36][37] Additionally, some impoverished households utilize idle land for planting oil-tea and blueberries in hopes of prosperity.[29] By 2012, the average annual income of farmers in Tingqian reached 5,558 yuan, an increase of 683 yuan from the previous year.[32] As of December 2015, there were 37,600 rural residents in the entire town,[36] with an average disposable income per rural resident of 9,318 yuan.[33]\n\nThe oil-tea planting project in Tingqian Town covers four villages: Liubi, Jieling, Tieniu, and Deng'ao. From 2013 to 2020, the initial phase of the project has seen a total investment of 1.25 billion yuan, planning to use an area of 100,000 mu to plant approximately 8.9 million oil-tea plants and intercrop about 800,000 hickories and ornamental trees.[38] Starting in May 2010, with the assistance of Jiangsu Jinzhi Company, 10 villages, including Tongzhai, Liubi, Huzhai, Caiqiao, Jiangchong, Changchong, and Shicang, underwent low hill and ridge transformation to establish a blueberry planting base covering an area of 30,000 mu.[2] The harvested blueberries are sold in supermarkets across China and are in high demand.[39] Tongzhai Village has been named the \"Hubei Blueberry Town\"[22] and was awarded the title of \"China Southern Small Berry Demonstration Base\"[40] by the Ministry of Agriculture, becoming a model village for small berries in China. On July 9, 2017, the town held the first Blueberry Picking Festival in Huangmei County.[41]\n\nOther industries[edit]\nTingqian town\nclass=notpageimage|\nLocation of Tingqian Town in China\n\nForestry is also a significant feature of Tingqian Town. In the 1980s, the entire Tingqian region (including present-day Liulin Township) had a afforested area of 32,823 mu,[11]: 58  mostly natural forests.[6] By December 2015, this number had increased to 73,000 mu (excluding Liulin Township).[36] The main trees in the area include pine, cedar, and bamboo,[11]: 58  implementing measures to develop an \"ecological forestry city\" and constructing Huangmei County's deep processing base for forestry.[32] Locals have heavily developed economic forests, establishing a 500-mu bamboo base and a 1,000-mu eco-friendly fruit tree base.[6] Since 2007, Dong Fan, a professor at China University of Geosciences and director of the China Mountaineering Association, has designated Nanchong Village in Tingqian as a field survival experience base for the school. Students are organized here for experiential training activities every semester.[6][32] Tingqian also relies on forestry and agriculture to develop its tourism industry.\n\nIn the livestock industry, Tingqian Town invested 30 million yuan to establish a modern Hu sheep breeding farm, and additionally constructed a poultry farm for 10,000 birds, a Polled goat breeding farm, among others, serving as demonstrations for existing breeding grounds.[31] The town also vigorously developed the pig farming industry and possessed farms like the Gujiao Pig Farm.[42] The Gujiao Reservoir produces 100,000 kilograms of fresh fish annually and is one of the major aquatic suppliers in the county.[11]: 58–59  In terms of industry, in 1972, areas like Tingqian began operating a phosphate fertilizer plant using a simple method of crushing phosphate rock and mixing it with sulfuric acid to produce phosphate fertilizer.[43]: 234  In the 1980s, the Tingqian Commune had a total of 16 commune-operated enterprises, including lime factories, agricultural machinery repair plants, phosphate fertilizer plants, orchards, and mulberry fields. Among these, the talcum powder factory's products were once sold to several other provinces, reaching an annual production of 2,000 tons.[3] By 2017, the entire town had a total of 26 enterprises with 639 employees; there were 6 industrial enterprises, with 1 being of a considerable scale (established in 2012).[19][32]\n\nPopulation[edit]\nDemographics[edit]\n\nAccording to the sixth national census in 2010, Tingqian had a population of 33,323 people, residing in 7,268 households, averaging 4.58 persons per household. There were 5,753 children under 14 years, constituting 17.26% of the total population; 24,158 individuals were between 15 and 64 years, accounting for 72.50% of the total population; and there were 3,412 elderly individuals aged 65 and above, representing 10.24% of the total population. There were 17,538 males, making up 52.63% of the total population, and 15,785 females, accounting for 47.37% of the total population. Among the local residents, 32,652 had local household registration, making up 97.99% of the total population.[44]\n\nIn 2015, the total registered population in the entire town was 40,998 people.[33] By the end of 2018, the total permanent population in the town was 29,184 people.[19]\n\nHistorical sites and relics[edit]\nA map of the entire territory of ancient Huangmei County was drawn in the second year of Emperor Guangxu's reign (1876), with Tingqian Town depicted in the upper right corner.\n\nThe ancient Tingqian Post Station, established in the 14th year of the Hongwu reign of the Ming Dynasty (1381), also known as the Taizi Post Station, derived its name from the Taizi Street of the ancient post (where a consort of the Ming Dynasty gave birth to a son).[15] Currently, several late-Qing Dynasty buildings remain, somewhat dilapidated yet retaining their ancient charm with carved beams, painted rafters, and ancient architectural styles. Adjacent to the ancient post, the Qingjiang Bridge was constructed over the Tingqian River, built in the first year of the Shunzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty (1644) and measuring over 17 zhang in length. By the 15th year of the Jiaqing reign (1810), more than half of the bridge had been washed away, and in 1954, the entire bridge collapsed.[5] Presently, remnants of the Qingjiang Bridge consist of several remaining bridge piers. In 1971, it was reconstructed, renamed the Tingqian Bridge, measuring 60 meters in length, 6 meters in width, with two spans, made of reinforced concrete, capable of bearing 15 tons.[45]: 171 \n\nAt the mid-slope of the western foothill of Hailuo Mountain in Tingqian Town lies the Hailuo Mountain Site, covering an area of 2,000 square meters, with a cultural layer approximately 0.3 meters thick, containing a large number of relics from the Western Zhou Dynasty. On a small hillside in Tingqian Town are the ruins of the Bangke Cliff Site, occupying an area of approximately 1,500 square meters. It is an irregular elongated shape, rising about 3 meters above the ground. In 1981, a member of the Tiechong Commune excavated a stone shovel, measuring 15 cm in length, 11.8 cm in width, 10.5 cm in bottom width, and 0.6 cm thick, with a hole diameter of 3 cm. Along with it, pottery fragments like tripod feet and li feet were discovered, indicating it to be a relic from the Shang and Zhou dynasties. Adjacent to the ancient post, about 200 meters away, lies the Wudang Palace Site. Covering an area of approximately 3,000 square meters, it is confirmed as a relic of an ancient village from the Shang and Western Zhou periods. Some of the buildings of the Wudang Palace, after the establishment of the People's Republic of China, were used as school classrooms and are currently part of the central school in Tingqian Town. The Chen River Site in Sanqu also holds artifacts from the Neolithic Age.[3]: 321 [46]: 552 \n\nIn April 1981, at the Fenghuang site of the Huzhai Brigade in Tingqian Commune (now Shuima Village), a large copper seal belonging to Xu Shouhui, a leader of a peasant uprising at the end of the Yuan Dynasty, weighing 1172.5 grams and measuring 11.7 square centimeters with a thickness of 1 centimeter, was unearthed. The front bears six large seal script characters reading \"Seal of Commanding Ten Thousand Households\", while the back side contains inscriptions in traditional Kai characters reading \"Made by the Ministry of Rites of the Central Secretariat\" and \"The Third Year of Taiping,[47] Month Unknown, Day Unknown\".[3]: 322 [46]: 554 \n\nWithin the area lies the tomb of a Song Dynasty kiln factory in Sanqu, located in the old Sanqu kiln factory, where copper mirrors, porcelain jars, and epitaphs were excavated in 1983.[46]: 556 \n\nTourism[edit]\n\nThe local plan is centered around the Guanjiao Reservoir, integrating cultural tourism resources like Wuzu Temple, aiming to construct a residential outdoor leisure area, creating the \"backyard\" of the East Hubei Zen Culture Tourism Area. Additionally, the town aims to build a livable area in the northern mountainous region.[2][32] Utilizing the tourism resources of the ancient Tingqian Post Station and the Guanjiao Reservoir, Tingqian is developing tourist spots like Tingqian Flower Fairy Valley and creating Tingqian Post Station New Area as a township.[48] Leveraging the advantages of the blueberry base, it's developing leisure tourism. During the blueberry flowering season, visitors can hike to enjoy the flowers, while during the harvest, they can pick and taste the blueberries.[49] Other tourism projects within Tingqian Town include the Nanchong Outdoor Climbing Training Base, Chaixia Agritainment, Panhe Hot Spring, Tongzhai Blueberry Ecotourism Corridor, among others.[22][32] The Longxu River Scenic Area project, with an investment of 500 million yuan, is scheduled to commence in September 2020. In 2018, Tingqian also developed the \"Tingqian Cedar Ten-Mile Sightseeing Corridor\", a pastoral complex.[48] These various tourism resources and scenic spots form distinctive mountainous tourist routes.[6]\n\nInfrastructure[edit]\nTingqian Central Kindergarten\n\nEarly Tingqian's town construction was developed in line with the growth of township enterprises.[43]: 232  Since the 21st century, with the local economy, especially tourism, booming, the town's infrastructure has undergone significant changes.[6][32] Historically, the town's transportation mainly consisted of rugged mountain paths due to the mountainous terrain. According to records, mountain residents experienced hardships, described as \"panting sounds, drip by drip, step by step up the ladder to the clouds\".[50]: 168–169  After Huangmei initiated poverty alleviation policies, road construction began. The Huangta Highway diagonally crosses the northern border, connecting Huangmei to Tingqian (Huangting Highway) in the south.[3]: 323 [11]: 59  The Huangta Highway was initially constructed in 1956 during the construction of the Guanjiao Reservoir, extending from Huangmei to the Guanjiao Reservoir dam. In 1966, it was extended to Tanfan Village in Liulin Township, spanning 32.25 kilometers. In 1975, the Xiaoting Highway was also constructed, covering a length of 16.8 kilometers from Xiahe Bridge to Tingqian.[45]: 321  Additionally, the Chengliu Highway traverses east-west for 10 kilometers; the Dabieshan Interior Highway (also known as Yanzhang Highway) runs north-south for 17.5 kilometers; the Huangsong Highway (from Huangguling to Erlang River in Susong County) spans 6 kilometers; there are 168 kilometers of hardened rural roads.[15][20] As for education, by 2012, Tingqian Town had a nine-year comprehensive school (Tingqian Town Nine-Year Comprehensive School), one middle school (Tingqian Town Middle School),[51] five primary schools including Tingqian Town Central School, and four primary schools and teaching points. The area has been promoting educational reform, optimizing layouts and resource allocations, striving for balanced development.[52]\n\nAdministrative division[edit]\n\nAs of 2019, Tingqian Town oversees a total of 21 village-level administrative areas, all of which are administrative villages.[14] Tingqian Village serves as the seat of the town government and is also the center for the economic and social development of Tingqian Town.[16][53]\n\nName\tArea Code\tName\tArea Code\nTingqian Village※\t421127105200\tJinzhai Village\t421127105201\nSanqu Village\t421127105202\tHuiluoshan Village\t421127105203\nZhoutang Village\t421127105204\tDeng'ao Village\t421127105205\nChaixia Village\t421127105206\tDongchong Village\t421127105207\nNanchong Village\t421127105208\tLiubi Village\t421127105209\nTongzhai Village\t421127105210\tJieling Village\t421127105211\nTieniu Village\t421127105212\tChangchong Village\t421127105213\nShicang Village\t421127105214\tCaiqiao Village\t421127105215\nHuzhai Village\t421127105216\tMeilong Village\t421127105217\nJiangchong Village\t421127105218\tPanhe Village\t421127105219\nJiangtao Village\t421127105220\t※ Indicates the seat of the town government.\nReferences[edit]\n^ 史为乐主编 (2005). \"亭前镇\". 中国历史地名大辞典·下 8画以上 (in Chinese).

It was loosely based on the short story Salomy Jane's Kiss by Bret Harte, but also pulled in characters from other Harte works.[1] It has four acts and five scenes, taking place over sixteen hours in Calaveras County, California around 1855.[2]\n\nThe play was produced by Liebler & Company, with staging by Hugh Ford, sets by Gates and Morange, incidental music by Robert Hood Bowers, and electrical effects by the Kliegl Brothers.[3] It starred Eleanor Robson, with H. B. Warner, Holbrook Blinn, and Ada Dwyer.[4] It ran on Broadway from January through May 1907, returned in September 1907 for a month then went on tour.[5]\n\nPaul Armstrong later expanded his drama into a screenplay for a 1914 silent film.[6]\n\nCharacters[edit]\n\nLead\n\nSalomy Jane Clay is a proud young woman with a cool manner towards suitors.\nThe Man is a young stranger who has come to the camp to avenge a woman.[fn 1]\n\nSupporting\n\nColonel Starbottle is a Kentucky Colonel, a Bret Harte character from other stories.\nYuba Bill is another Bret Harte stock character, a rambunctious stage driver.\nJack Marbury is a third Bret Harte stock character (Jack Hamlin in other stories), a gambler.\nRufe Waters is a young stockman interested in Salomy Jane who fails to show mettle.\n\nFeatured\n\nMadison Clay is Salomy Jane's widower father, a stockraiser from Kentucky with a quarter section of land.\nPhil Larrabee is an enemy of Madison Clay who has carried a feud from their Kentucky home.\nRed Pete Heath is a good-for-nothing drunken husband who turns to stagecoach robbery.\nSeth Low is the \"Sheriff\", leader of the vigilantes.\nWillie Smith is about 10, antecedents unclear, who wants to become a stage driver like Yuba Bill.\nLize Heath is Red Pete's long-suffering wife and mother of his two girls.\nMary Ann Heath is about 8, the older daughter of Lize Heath and Red Pete, friend to Willie Smith.\nAnna May Heath is about 6, the younger daughter of Lize Heath and Red Pete.\n\nWalk-on\n\nVigilantes\n\nOff-stage\n\nBaldwin betrayed the Man's sister, and later accosted Salomy Jane.\nSynopsis[edit]\n\nThe play was never published; this synopsis is based on newspaper reviews from 1907.\n\nAct I (Afternoon, meeting place of the Vigilantes in the Redwoods.) The vigilantes have called a meeting about some stagecoach robbers that held up and wounded Yuba Bill. At the meeting Larrabee and Madison Clay confront each other, but are separated and warned by Seth Low not to start a feud in California. Salomy Jane urges would-be beau Rufe Waters to avenge her honor upon Baldwin, but he hesitates. Later Baldwin is found dead, and Rufe secretly tells Salomy Jane that he slew him. She then allows him to put a ring on her finger. Anna May wanders in with a bangle that Yuba Bill recognizes from the robbery. The vigilantes now know they are hunting Red Pete. As they go out, Salomy Jane encounters the Man, and learns he was avenging his sister when he slew Baldwin. She brings him food and lets him go.\n\nAct II (Evening, exterior of Red Pete's shack.) Yuba Bill tells Lize Heath that her husband Red Pete was one of the robbers who held up his stagecoach. Yuba Bill figures that means Red Pete will be abandoning her, since he is known to the vigilantes. But the vigilantes bring Red Pete and the young Man, who was also caught, into the clearing, so Pete can say goodbye to his family. Lize, despite Red's abuse of her, rails against vigilante justice until Pete stops her. Both men are to be hung for robbery, but Pete says the Man had nothing to with it. The vigilantes start to free him, when Rufe accuses him of Baldwin's murder. They decide to hang him, and Seth Low invites Salomy Jane to say goodbye to the young fellow who has no one else. Salomy Jane, impressed by the Man's stoicism and sense of honor, kisses him in front of the gathering. As they depart with their captives, Jack Marbury quietly slips some gold coins into Lize's apron while she sobs unaware.\n\nAct III (Night, exterior of Madison Clay's home.) Returning home, Salomy Jane and her father learn Red Pete was hung, but the young stranger escaped. Col. Starbottle warns Madison that Larrabee is goning to ambush him. Starbottle, like Yuba Bill and Jack Marbury, are all trying to court Salomy Jane. She fends off the older men with humor, and tells Jack Marbury she likes but doesn't love him. However, she is scathing with Rufe when he reproaches her for kissing the Man: \"When you hang, I'll kiss you too\". Later, Salomy is awakened by a noise outside the cabin. Taking her father's shotgun with her in case its Larrabee, she finds the Man. He tells Salomy Jane he's come back to thank her. When Rufe comes by, stalking the Man, Salomy disguises him with her father's hat and duster. The disguise doesn't fool Jack Marbury, who holds the Man at gunpoint. Salomy Jane persuades Jack to let him go.\n\nAct IV (Scene 1: Dawn, same as Act III.) Larrabee, mistaking the Man for Madison Clay tries to shoot him, but is himself shot by the Man using Madison's shotgun. Roused by the shots, neighbors come running. Salomy tries to hide the gun, but Madison see her with it and tells everyone he shot Larrabee. Soon Madison, Salomy, and the Man are all fugitives. Madison leads the vigilantes in one direction, to give Salomy time to get a horse.\n\n(Scene 2: Dawn, at the Corral of Madison Clay.) At the corral Salomy Jane tells the Man to pick out a horse for their escape. They are caught by Rufe, who holds them at gunpoint. The Man calls Rufe's bluff, knowing he doesn't have to nerve to fire. He further frightens Rufe by saying he'll strangle him like he did Baldwin. Rufe fades away and the couple make their escape. (Curtain)\n\nOriginal production[edit]\nBackground[edit]\n\nLiebler & Company was a partnership between investor Theodore A. Liebler and producer-manager George C. Tyler. After Robson's success in Merely Mary Ann, they leased the Liberty Theatre for the 1906-1907 season, in order to showcase her in several new plays.[7] These were Nurse Marjorie by Israel Zangwill; Susan in Search of a Husband by Eugene Presbray, based on a Jerome K. Jerome story;[fn 2] and The Girl Who Has Everything by Clyde Fitch. According to Tyler's 1934 memoir, none of the three was very successful,[7] so he commissioned Paul Armstrong to write another.[8] Armstrong completed Salomy Jane in one week.[7]\n\nCast[edit]\nPrincipal cast during the original Broadway run.\nRole\tActor\tDates\tNotes and sources\nSalomy Jane\tEleanor Robson\tJan 19, 1907 - May 18, 1907\t\nThe Man\tH.

B. Warner playing the male lead.\n\nThese matinees led to a minor contremps when Paul Armstrong protested the playing of Merely Mary Ann in conjunction with Salomy Jane, claiming long tradition would ascribe weakness to a new work if an older play supported it.[15] George C. Tyler replied that Armstrong's contract with Liebler & Company was for an indefinite period and the playwright couldn't expect Miss Robson to go on playing Salomy Jane forever and nothing else.[16]\n\nClosing[edit]\n\nThe initial Broadway run of Salomy Jane finished at the Liberty Theatre on May 18, 1907.[17] It would return September 2, 1907 as the first of several works in repretory, previous hits of Eleanor Robson such as Merely Mary Ann and Nurse Marjorie.[17]\n\nAdaptations[edit]\nFilm[edit]\nSalomy Jane (1914)\nSalomy Jane (1923)\nWild Girl (1932)\nNotes[edit]\n^ The original Bret Harte story revealed his name to be Jack Dart.\n^ This was double-billed with a one-act play, A Tenement Tragedy by Clotilde Graves, written especially for Eleanor Robson.\n^ In Broadway theaters, Wednesdays and Saturdays were the traditional days for matinees.\n^ A traditional perogative of playwrights at this time, which fell out of fashion after 1910.\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b \"Bret Harte Melodrama\".

He later served as director of Voice of America's Ukrainian-language service.\n\nBiography[edit]\n\nNykyfor Yakovych Hryhoriiv was born in the village of Burty [uk], in the Kiev Governorate of the Russian Empire into a family of educators. He completed his education in the city of Horodyshche before becoming a librarian in the city of Kiev. In 1904 he became a teacher, illegally teaching classes in Ukrainian in the region of Podolia.[1] A member of the Society of Ukrainian Progressives [uk], he was also head of the regional branch of the Prosvita organisation. He wrote for the Ukrainian periodicals Rada, Beacon, Light, and Podolian News, and served in the Imperial Russian Army from 1915 to 1917.[2]\n\nFollowing the establishment of the Ukrainian People's Republic Hryhoriiv joined the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party and became president of the Kyiv Council of Soldiers' Deputies, representing the council in the Central Rada. As president of the council, he advanced efforts to establish a Ukrainian army for the newly-established country.[3] From January to February of 1918, he also served as Minister of Education in Vsevolod Holubovych's government.[1]\n\nAfter the 1918 Ukrainian coup d'état Hryhoriiv went underground, becoming a member of Volodymyr Vynnychenko's Ukrainian National Union [uk]. Following the Anti-Hetman Uprising he served as a member of the newly-established Labour Congress, and was director of the press service of the Ukrainian People's Army. He served as a member of the USRP's central committee, and opposed the pro-Soviet Borotbist faction.[3] He again served as Minister of Education from April 1919 to May 1920, and in November 1920 fled to Poland.[2] He moved to Czechoslovakia the next year,[3] and in 1922 he co-founded the Ukrainian Husbandry Academy [uk] in Poděbrady.[1]\n\nHryhoriiv's political career continued in exile; he continued to serve as on the USRP's central committee in exile, and in 1932 became head of the party. He continued to profess socialist and left-wing nationalist views, viewing them as intermingled with Ukrainian aspirations for self-determination. He was also active in promoting awareness of social sciences among Ukrainians. Following the occupation of Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany, Hryhoriiv fled to the United States, where he continued to be active in Ukrainian cultural spheres. In 1949 he became director of Voice of America's Ukrainian-language service, a position he would hold until his death.[2]\n\nHryhoriiv died in New York City on 5 August 1953.[3] His son, Myroslav [uk], was an artist and graphic designer.[2]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c Ostashko, Tetiana. \"ГРИГОРІЇВ НИКИФІР ЯКОВИЧ\" [Hryhoriiv, Nykyfir Yakovych].

An innovative and progressive company, General Bronze Corporation stepped up to supply that demand. It became the dominant leader in the architectural bronze industry for both bronze fabrication and bronze sculpture, and the aluminum fabrication in the United States for over three decades.[1] In the early 1950s, General Bronze was also at the forefront of the fledgling television radio industry as a major manufacturer of radio antennas, and one of the first to introduce automatic motorized antennas for the automobile industry.[12] General Bronze's Brach Manufacturing subdivision offered electronics to the early radio telescope field, such as the Green Bank Telescope of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia[13][14] and the Arecibo Radio Telescope.[11]\n\nOverextending their resources by diverting capital from bronze manufacturing to antenna and radio telescope research, concomitant with the declining use of bronze in the construction industry due to changes in architectural style, eclipsed General Bronze's main focus leading to their ultimate demise.[15] In 1967, they were acquired by Allied Products of Chicago, IL, and ceased to exist.[16][17][18]\n\nHistory and establishment[edit]\n\nGeneral Bronze Corporation was founded as a reorganization of the John Polachek Bronze and Iron Company, founded in 1910 by John Polachek, a Hungarian immigrant.[19] He became a supervisor overseeing bronze manufacturing at the Tiffany Glass Studios in Corona, Queens New York, which served as the basis for his future enterprise in bronze fabrication.[20]\n\nLouis C. Tiffany\n\nTiffany Glass Studios, made famous by Louis C. Tiffany commonly referred to his product as ‘’’favrile glass or \"Tiffany glass, and used bronze in their artisan work, particularly for his Tiffany lamps.[21][22][23][24][1] In 1910, Polachek left Tiffany Glass Studios and opened his own bronze architectural company called the John Polacheck Bronze Company. In 1912 he purchased a 1.75 acre site in Long Island City, Queens at 34–19 Tenth Street and grew it into one of the most important bronze fabricators in the field. In 1927, Polacheck merged his new company with another metals fabricator, the Renaissance Bronze and Iron Works located in Long Island City, Queens. The new company became known as the General Bronze Corporation. In 1934, General Bronze Corporation was the largest company in the architectural bronze industry in the United States, employing 600 workers with assets over $5 million.[1]\n\nPolachek's grand idea was to become the leader in the use of bronze for metal fabrication as he foresaw the worldwide demand for the metal alloy would only increase. This was due to a rise in the use of bronze in the architectural and art world, and Polacheck leaped at the opportunity. The sought-after metal coincided with the timing of the art-deco, art nouveau, and international art movements, in which it became popular to use bronze. Polacheck's intuition paid off, as he cornered the bronze fabrication market. Coinciding with the rise of art deco, art nouveau, and international styles of art and design, bronze and aluminum became popular and were implemented in art and the construction industry. As General Bronze gained notoriety, the company quickly became the forerunner.[6][15] General Bronze's most acclaimed entry to the construction industry was the bronze mullion I-beams for the Seagram Building[25][26][5] and the no-set-back windows clad in aluminum for the United Nations Secretariat Building[9][8][27] and the Chase Manhattan Bank Building.[28][29][10]\n\nThe company purchased the Brach Manufacturing Company of Newark, New Jersey, as one of its subsidiaries in the 1950s.[30] GBC intended to become a pioneer in the development of television antennas.[31] During this period, GBC was closely identified with the leadership of Aaron Saphier.[32] He became general manager after the company's founding, and served as president from 1931 to 1959, remaining active as chairman of the board until the end of 1960.[1]\n\nDuring the 1930s through 1950s, the General Bronze Corporation's seemingly impregnable stature as one of America's leaders in metals and especially the architectural bronze industry began to weaken as General Bronze expanded beyond their main focus with their developing interest in marketing consumer communications with antennas, as well as aluminum-manufactured products.[31][33] As General Bronze began to face increasing domestic competition from international electronics firms like RCA, Sony, Philips, Matsushita and Mitsubishi, they continued primarily manufacturing aluminum windows, that which they were known for on prior construction projects, such as the Tripler Army Base Hospital in Hawaii.[33] General Bronze began manufacturing aluminum windows for the American construction industry after World War II suffered enormous financial losses and other failed projects including the loss of existing contracts with metal fabrication partners. This occurred simultaneously with the failed attempt to secure a bid for the Arecibo Radio Telescope and the Green Bank Telescope in Green Bank, WV. The company slowly rebounded by the early 1960s, but never regained its former eminence. General Bronze was eventually acquired by Allied Products Corporation of Chicago, IL in 1967, a company which was once owned by the present Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker's uncle, Jay Pritzker.[16][17]\n\nGeneral Bronze Subsidiaries[edit]\nBronze Art[edit]\nAtlas in the International Building's plaza\n\nThe General Bronze Corporation, with the acquisition of the Roman Bronze Works, became the primary company behind many of America's most famous buildings and sculptures.[6][34] Early man has used bronze throughout history. In the ancient Mayan, Egyptian, Greek, and Roman ruins, bronze tools, instruments, statues, and weapons has always been found in an almost perfect state of preservation.[34] \"Centuries hence there will undoubtedly be many fine works of bronze that will bear eloquent testimony to craftsmanship of our day.\"[34]\n\nPrometheus (1934)\n\nThe world's most acclaimed sculptors produced some of the finest works seen in the United States by General Bronze. \"Many visitors to Rockefeller Center have always admired the bronze statuary which helped make it one of the wonders of the modern world, such as the art deco Atlas by Lee Lawrie, and the Prometheus by Paul Manship.\"[34] Other well-known and exceptional Rockefeller Center sculptures admired worldwide are on display for visitors to marvel and take photographs. These include the whimsical fountain figures by Rene Chambellan adorning the fountain flanking Paul Manship's Prometheus statue. Lee Lawrie's Atlas sculpture in the plaza of Rockefeller Center's International Building at its 5th Avenue entrance, and the aluminum \"Spirit of the Dance\" of William Zorach at Rockefeller Center's Radio City Music Hall, New York.[35]\n\nA promenade fountain by Rene Paul Chambellan at Rockefeller Center\nRoman Bronze Works[edit]\n\nThe General Bronze Corporation became the leader of the most famous bronze sculptures of the 20th Century, particularly after it bought the Roman Bronze Works.[6][36] The Roman Bronze Works \"had seen many of America's greatest sculptors.\" Under the ownership of General Bronze, it produced some of its finest bronze artworks, from sculptors such as Manship to Remington.[6] The General Bronze Corporation purchased the Roman Bronze Works in 1928. This ownership lasted for twenty years, up until 1948.[24] General Bronze’s newly purchased foundry produced “virtually all of the sculpture for Rockefeller Center, numerous national monuments, and many sculptures for the W.P.A, in addition to its usual complement of private commissions.\"[6] The Roman Bronze works excelled in the lost-wax casting method and permitted large works to be cast in one piece. Most of the sculptures at Rockefeller Center, like the statues of Prometheus and Atlas, were cast at the Corona, Queens building.[24]\n\nEarly on, the Roman Bronze Works’ use of the lost-wax casting technique, was eyed by Polachek as he once worked there.[1] Begun in 1899 by Riccardo Bertelli, an immigrant who attained technical knowledge of European methods of casting bronze in wax from his native Genoa, Italy, flourished under his management while casting primarily art sculpture.[22] In 1928, the prized foundry was purchased by John Polacheck of General Bronze, not only for its workers and workmanship but for the sizable physical plant in Corona, Queens.[24] It was then purchased by General Bronze Corporation and became a subsidiary.[24] Under General Bronze's leadership, Roman Bronze Works produced America's finest patriotic monuments, statues, and most ornate public doors.[6] The factory was the old Tiffany Studios in Corona, Queens, at the southwest corner of 43rd Avenue and 97th place, where it was used to cast art sculptures of bronze designs for sculptors, and bronze architectural elements such as floor registers, door jambs, window casings, lamps, and sconces, most notably for Tiffany.[22]\n\nTiffany table lamp with bronze\n\nThe building had undergone a metamorphosis of name changes, beginning with the Tiffany Glass and Decorating Company, in 1892. Arthur J. Nash, apparently became Tiffany's partner, as Nash applied the favrile glass technique learned from his hometown of Stourbridge, England to the glassworks produced by Tiffany.[22] Thereafter, its name evolved from being called the Stourbridge Glass Company in 1893 (in deference to the technique learned from Nash's hometown), to the Tiffany Glass Furnaces, and finally to the Tiffany Studios. Stourbridge Glass Company was absorbed by Tiffany into the Tiffany Furnaces in 1902. \"Within this complex, Tiffany carried out experiments in glass colors and pottery glazing, perfected techniques of assembling stained glass windows.\"[22] “By 1901, Tiffany was at the peak of his profession. But Tiffany’s glass fell out of favor in the 1910s, and by the 1920s a foundry had been installed for a separate bronze company. In 1932 Tiffany Studios filed for bankruptcy. Ownership of the complex passed back to the Roman Bronze Works, which had served as a subcontractor to Tiffany in prior years.”[23][21][37] In 1948, General Bronze relinquished ownership of the Roman Bronze Works foundry and was brought back under family control rather than remaining corporate. General Bronze Corporation sold off the subsidiary to a family member of a prior employee of the Roman Bronze Works to the Schiavo family, who had once been employed by Roman Bronze Works.[24]\n\nUnited States Supreme Court bronze doors by Gilbert Donnelly, Sr., and his son John Donnelly, Jr.\n\nThe largest and most ornate bronze fountain known to be cast in the world was by the Roman Bronze Works and General Bronze Corporation in 1952. The material used for the fountain, known as statuary bronze, is a quaternary alloy made of copper, zinc, tin, and lead, and traditionally golden brown in color. This was made for the Andrew W. Mellon Memorial in Federal Triangle in Washington, DC.[38] Another example of the massive, ornate design projects attibuted to General Bronze/Roman Bronze Works were the massive doors to the United States Supreme Court Building in Washington, DC.[39]\n\nArchitectural Bronze and Metals[edit]\n\nWhen the United States entered World War II in December 1941, the federal government required metal for use in the war effort. General Bronze Corporation began assisting in the manufacture of weapons, such as machine gun emplacements.[40] General Bronze became a major manufacturer to the American war effort.[41] Upon its founding, General Bronze Corporation was one of the largest metal fabricators in New York City.[15][40]\n\nSeagram Building[edit]\nThe Seagram Building viewed from across Park Avenue at 52nd Street\n\nThe Seagram Building on New York City's Park Avenue remains the \"iconic glass box sheathed in bronze, designed by Mies van der Rohe.\"[26] To supply the demand for bronze required for the construction, the General Bronze Corporation fabricated 3,200,000 pounds (1,600 tons) at its plant in Garden City, New York.[5]\n\nView of the columns and bays at the lobby's northwestern corner\n\nThe building \"exuded transparency, as an expression of Mies van der Rohe’s near-mystic faith in structure as the foundation of architecture.\"[42] The Seagram Building is a 38-story, 516-foot bronze-and-topaz-tinted glass slab, in the purest expression of Mies van der Rohe style, where 27-foot bays or recessed areas offer the eye a perfect Cartesian grid.[26] The building looks like a \"squarish 38-story tower clad in a restrained curtain wall of metal and glass.\"[25] Structural columns form bays that are divided by \"extruded bronze-covered I-beam mullions, which run the entire length of the façade.\"[26] The most interesting fact about the Seagram Building is that it was the first time that an entire building was sheathed in bronze.[5] Another interesting fact was that New York City's zoning laws were reconfigured for the Seagram Building, so that setbacks were no longer required. \"This proved to be a no-setback building but a building all set back,\"[25] since the entire building was set back 100 feet from Park Avenue. \"Bronze was selected because of its color, both before and after aging, its corrosion resistance, and its extrusion properties.\"[42] The extrusion process, where malleable metal is \"forced through dies by pressure produced the bronze mullions — vertical lines between windows,\"[42] set the Seagram Building apart from all other buildings worldwide. The effect Mies van der Rohe obtained was the \"sharp edges\" between the glass and the bronze.[42] \"One is as much aware of the metal as of the glass that forms most of the building’s walls.\"[42] This produced the desired design by Mies van der Rohe. It was not only the most expensive building of its time — $36 million — but it was the first building in the world with floor-to-ceiling glass walls.[28] Mies van der Rohe achieved the crips edges that were custom-made with specific detailing by General Bronze[5][42] and \"even the screws that hold in the fixed glass-plate windows are made of brass.\"[26] William Jordy, an acclaimed architectural historian, said that the Seagram Building was \"the first metal-and-glass skyscraper consciously designed to age as masonry buildings age—as appropriate for Seagram's whisky, as sheen to Lever's soap.\"[26]\n\nUnited Nations Secretariat Building[edit]\nWestern or front view of the The U.N. Secretariat, reflecting 1st Avenue buildings on the sheer face of the glass façade in classic postwar International design\n\nIt was remarked early on that the United Nations Secretariat Building was the world's largest window.[27] It was 287 feet wide and 544 feet tall, described as \"two great windows (front, or western exposure, and back, or eastern sides of the building), framed in Vermont marble.\"[27] General Bronze Corporation manufactured and supplied the building with 5400 individual windows, spandrel frames, louvers, and architectural metalwork since at that time it was the world's largest fabricator of aluminum and other non-ferrous metals.[8] The land had been donated by the Rockefeller family, the old slaughterhouse district along the East River bordered by First Avenue between East 41st and East 47th Streets.[27] The most important building in the UN Plaza was the UN Secretariat Building, overshadowing the UN General Assembly Building. The group of architects, overseen by a lead architect, was Wallace Harrison. He coordinated an international group of designers which included Sven Markelius, Le Corbusier, and Oscar Niemeyer.[9]\n\nThe East River site for the U.N, extending some 1500 feet from 42nd to 48th Streets, from First Avenue to the edge of the East River, had a \"sufficient scale for applying the fundamental elements of modern urbanism, sunlight, and verdure.[8] Protected, yet given spaciousness by the wide expanse of the East River, the site has breadth enough to be made a living unit of strength, dignity, and harmony, befitting a building which embodied the world.\"[8] Although located in New York City, the land the U.N. rents is strictly under the administration of the U.N. and extraterritorial by a treaty with the U.S. Government. The Secretariat Building dwarfs the General Assembly Building and contains executive offices for the Secretary General, the Deputy Secretary General and the Under-Secretary-General of the U.N.; offices for the major U. N. Councils; many general business offices: legal department, public information, transportation, translators, interpreters, typing pools, dining rooms, places of worship, etc.\n\nFlags of the member states of the U.N.\n\nThe vast aluminum windows manufactured by General Bronze on the east and west building walls are cantilevered beyond the structural steel columns and are supported within the light aluminum framework on double-hung aluminum sashes and fitted with blue-green heat-absorbing plate glass.[8] The iconic building sits as a testament to world unity.[27] Wallace Harrison, the lead architect, \"insisted that air-conditioning was its cornerstone, unlike Le Corbusier who wanted windows that could be opened. General Bronze manufactured the windows from Harrison's innovative design, \"a curtain wall catilevered two feet, nine inches, in front of the steel structure so that it formed a flush skin of blue-green Thermopane heat-absorbing glass, painted black on the inner face.\"[27] The International Style design, much like the Seagram Building, \"represented postwar (World War II) prosperity; for Europe it was a chance to rebuild; and for developing countries it stood for a brighter future.[8][9][27]\n\nChase Manhattan Bank Building[edit]\nLooking up from the plaza below\n\nThe Chase Manhattan Bank Building, once known as One Chase Manhattan Plaza, at 28 Liberty Street, is a \"sheer, 60-story, 813-foot-tall aluminum-and-glass-sheathed tower which contains 1.8 million square feet.\"[28] \"The General Bronze Corporation engineered and manufactured the ¼ inch-thick aluminum panels — some as tall as 13 feet — which enclose the perimeter piers, as well as the extruded H-shaped aluminum mullions that flank the windows.[10][29] General Bronze assured that the \"aluminum panels would be recessed flush with the inside faces of the huge (2-foot, 10-inch by 4-foot, 11-inch) aluminum-sheathed columns.\" The curtain wall consists of a 4-foot 7-inch-high, two-tone aluminum spandrel and sill panel and an 8-foot-high window of clear glass. All of the natural-finished aluminum has a matte texture, as does the narrow black-anodized aluminum sill panel. Each bay is subdivided by five extruded aluminum mullions which are spaced 4 feet, 10 inches on center concerning each other and to the structural columns.\"[29] Skidmore, Owings & Merrill built the present structure, where the \"shining, anodized-aluminum skin stood out among the dark towers of Wall Street like a newly minted coin.\"[28] The Chase Manhattan Bank Building was built on the first commercial \"superblock\" in New York ever since John D. Rockefeller Jr. developed Rockefeller Center.[29] It was Rockefeller's money that \"revitalized New York's financial district and paved the way for other Lower Manhattan projects like the World Trade Center and the South Street Seaport.\"[28] The building was constructed after a change in New York City's building and zoning laws so that the area was large enough for Skidmore, Owings & Merrill to accommodate the building. The political method employed was a \"demapping\" (literally, removing a street from the city plan) of Lower Manhattan.[28]\" The building sits on a two-and-a-half-acre plot after Cedar Street was removed, \"to form a superblock, bordered by Pine, Liberty, William, and Nassau Streets.[29][28] The Chase Manhattan Building, the trademark for David Rockefeller and the empire forged by his grandfather John D. Rockefeller, rise \"60 steel-ribbed stories out of the dark canyons of the financial district, the great glass and aluminum slab of the Chase Manhattan Bank stands at 813 feet, the sixth tallest building in the city and the world,\"[29] in 1961. There are 2,239,530 square feet of gross floor area, and \"is the largest banking operation ever assembled under one roof, costing $813 million, the largest total investment in a building of its type, and detail for detail, in overall quality as well as outright size, one of the most remarkable planning, architectural, and engineering accomplishments,\"[29] at the time it was built.\n\nL.S. Brach Manufacturing Corporation and Antennas[edit]\n\nThe radio industry had been making technical advances, particularly in the area of antenna technology, and instituted antenna design/model production for the MIT Lincoln Laboratory at Massachussetts Institute of Technology, NASA, and the Bureau of Standards.[31] Since General Bronze has enormous access to the aluminum industry, it pursued the acquisition of L.S. Brach Manufacturing Corporation[43] in 1948 to gain a foothold in the field of radio technology and Brach's patents.[30] Ira Kamen became the director of the Brach Manufacturing Corporation, while George Doundoulakis became the Director of Research. Kamen had hired Doundoulakis at the RCA Institutes in New York City. Doundoulakis had experience working on the DEW Line system earlier.[44] Kamen believed that with his expertise and Doundoulakis' energy, they both would forge ahead and seek to gain contracts in the expanding field of radio telescopes. Doundoulakis had been tutored by Kamen, an electrical engineer, in New York City who taught at the RCA Institutes. Doundoulakis, a physicist, had gained a solid foothold in the field of electronics and was encouraged by Kamen to also teach at the RCA Institutes. Subsequently, in 1956, both Doundoulakis and Kamen filed their first US patent.[45] Later, Doundoulakis and Kamen co-authored a book on \"Scatter Propagation.\"[44] Doundoulakis hired Stanley Gethen, and together, both filed patents for antenna designs and radar-related projects for General Bronze.[46][47] Brach Electronics had developed antennas for the automobile industry, which included motorized antennas.[48][12]\n\nNational Radio Astronomy Observatory – Green Bank, WV[edit]\nGreen Bank Radio Telescope\n\nGeneral Bronze Corporation's (GBC) Brach subsidiary had been interested in radio telescope research in addition to automobile and boat antennas. GBC was requested, and then bid for the construction of the 90-foot and the 140-foot radio telescopes in Green Bank, VA, for the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO).[14] The plans submitted from General Bronze include details of the bid.[13] The Green Bank, WV, antennas were managed by the Associated Universities Incorporated (AUI), a consortium of scientists, initially from nine northeastern universities, dedicated to developing and building scientific tools for the community.[31] GBC submitted design proposals for both the 85-foot and 140-foot radio telescopes. Ira Kamen, as director of the Brach subdivision was in direct communication with Richard Emberson, who was the assistant to the president of AUI at the founding of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. In 1957, he became the project manager for the development of Green Bank, West Virginia radio telescopes. Kamen worked with the AUI, the overseeing entity between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the NRAO at Green Bank. General Bronze's technical drawings, photographs, and correspondence in 1957–58, at the outset of the design and construction of the Green Bank Telescopes are referenced.[13][14] However, GBC's bid was not accepted as a contractor for either the 85-foot or the 140-foot radio projects.\n\nArecibo Radio Telescope[edit]\nThe Arecibo radio telescope in 2019\n\nOn the day the project for the design and construction of the Arecibo Radio telescope was announced at Cornell University, Professor William Gordon of the electrical engineering department envisioned a 133 m (435 ft) single tower centered in a 305 m (1,000 ft) reflector to support an antenna feed. He proposed that this antenna would \"be fed from a horn on a high tower.\"[49][50][51][52] Gordon also suggested a tripod or four-legged design similar to the arches of the St. Louis Gateway Arch to suspend the antenna feed.[49] Subsequently, Cornell University and Zachary Sears published a request for proposal (RFP) requesting a design to support an antenna feed moving along a spherical surface 133 metres (435 ft) above a stationary reflector. The RFP recommended to those chosen antenna companies that a tripod or a tower in the center to support an antenna feed was conceptualised by Gordon.[50][49][51]\n\nThe RFP was mailed out to all major antenna companies/researchers in the field. George Doundoulakis received the RFP from Aaron Saphier, CEO of General Bronze Corporation. GBC had previously submitted proposals for the radio telescope at Green Bank, WV under the auspices of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory from GBC's Brach subdivision.[31] General Bronze presented their proposal in the final round in December 1959, in Ithaca, New York at Cornell for their antenna suspension design RFPs.[11] Doundoulakis had studied the idea of suspending the feed with his brother, Helias Doundoulakis, a civil engineer who received his master's thesis in bridge suspension from Brooklyn Polytechnic.[51][53] George Doundoulakis recognised that Gordon's idea of supporting the proposed radio telescope's antenna feed from a tower, tripod, or four-legged structure around the center, (the most crucial area of the reflector), would severely limit the reception of radio waves.[49] George Doundoulakis thought of a more practical way of suspending the antenna feed — by cables from four towers – thereby eliminating the problem of a \"high\" tower in the center of the reflector. Both George and Helias Doundoulakis told professors Gordon and Gold at the RFP meetings on 14 December 1959 \"General Bronze Corporation proposes a radical departure from the other companies: two suspension bridges perpendicular to one another which will double for an antenna.\"[11] He presented this proposal to Cornell University for his idea for three-and-a-half hours, while other companies were given 45 minutes.[11] They explained how the antenna feed would hang at the intersection of two suspension bridges — in turn, supported by four towers — by a doughnut or torus-type truss attached to the antenna feed.\"[11] Doundoulakis informed Professors Gordon and Gold that the tower/tripod/four-legged designs, compared to his towers/suspension bridge idea, were major engineering challenges with high construction costs.[11][50]Helias Doundoulakis designed the cable suspension system – with assignees William J. Casey and Constantine Michalos – that was finally adopted. It is essentially the same design as in the original drawings by Doundoulakis – although configured with three towers rather than four towers in Doundoulakis, Michalos, and Casey's patent.[54]\n\nControversy arose after Helias Doundoulakis, Constantine Michalos, and William J. Casey (CIA director under President Ronald Reagan) discovered the suspension design was used by Cornell University without their permission as exclusive patent holders.[54][11] They subsequently filed a lawsuit, originally for $1.2 million but was settled for $10,000 because \"the defense in a court trial would cost far more than the $10,000 for which the case was settled,\" and accordingly, on April 11, 1975, Doundoulakis v. U.S. (Case 412-72) had been ruled in plaintiff's favor by the United States Court of Federal Claims, that \"(a) a judgment has been entered in favor of the plaintiffs Helias Doundoulakis, William J. Casey, and Constantine Michalos against the United States and (b) in consideration of the sum of $10,000 to be paid by the United States Government to the plaintiff, the plaintiffs grants to the United States Government an irrevocable, fully-paid, non-exclusive license under the aforesaid U.S. Patent No. 3, 273, 156 to Cornell University.\"[11]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d e f g \"John Polachek, An Industrialist\" (PDF).

Kirk) Weibe is a former intelligence official with the United States National Security Agency[1], conspiracy theorist,[2][3] and whistleblower.[4] Kirk managed data programs and criticized the NSA's data-collection policies during the Barack Obama administration.[5] He made the false claim that Russia interfered with the 2016 US election was not true. Weibe argued Russia was not behind the hacked the DNC server.[6]\n\nWeibe would go on to spread conspiracies about Qanon[7] and claims of election fraud in 2020 United States presidential election[8]\n\nBiography[edit]\n\nBorn in Chicago, Illinois, Kirk grew up in northern Indiana, near Lake Michigan. After graduating high school Weibe enlisted in the United States Air Force and spending four years with the intelligence branch from 1963 – 1967. After the Air Force Kirk attended Indiana University, receiving a Master’s Degree in the Russian language in 1974. Kirk then took a position in the National Security Agency (NSA), retiring in October of 2001[9]\n\nWhistle blowing[edit]\n\nIn September 2002, Kiebe, along with William Binney and Edward Loomis, filed a request for the U.S. Defense Department Inspector General (DoD IG) to investigate the NSA for allegedly wasting \"millions and millions of dollars\" on Trailblazer[10]Wiebe developed a competing system, ThinThread, which was shelved when Trailblazer was chosen instead.[11] The Whistleblower's complaint noted Trailblazer's ineffectiveness and unjustified high cost compared to their alternative ThinThread.[12]\n\nConspiracy Theories[edit]\nRussian Election Interference[edit]\n\nAs a member of the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity Kiebe would claim that U.S. intelligence community's assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election was falsifed, and that the Democratic National Committee e-mails were leaked by an insider instead.[13][14]\n\nKiebe and VIPS colleagues argued argued that the metadata in files associated with the DNC Hack were altered to add Russian fingerprints, and that file transfer rate proved they were transferred locally[15]\n\nThe memorandum from Kiebe et al were promoted by Breitbart and Fox News. PresidentDonald Trump would then request Mike Pompeo to meet report authors.[16] The theory was later debunked and it was proved VIP's director Blinney was given fabricated data from a Pro-Russian outlet.[17][18]\n\nQANON[edit]\n\nKirk Wiebe was a major voice in spreading Qanon.[19] He would appear on podcasts spreading Qanon theories like movies such as I am Legend were really secret documentaries.[20]\n\nAccording to David Troy many members of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity were essential in spreading Qanon lies.[21]\n\n2020 US Presidential Election Fraud[edit]\n\nJ. Kirk Wiebe was very involved in spreading false conspiracies about election fraud in the 2020 United_States presidential election[22]. Wiebe would appear with [LaRouche_movement|Larouche]] memebers in Stop the Steal round tables[23] Conspiracy conspirasists would insist in court filings that tools developed by Wiebe proved massive voter fraud.[24]\n\nWiebe would go on to work with Mike Lindell to prove election fraud. Wiebe would state that Lindell did not have evidence to back up his claims.[25].\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ Page, Peter Eisler and Susan. \"3 NSA veterans speak out on whistle-blower: We told you so\".

{"date": "2023-12-24-13-50", "error": false, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wayne_Babcock", "text_blocks": "William Wayne Babcock\nBorn\tJune 10, 1872\nEast Worcester, New York, U.S.\nDied\tFebruary 23, 1963 (aged 90)\nNationality\tAmerican\nOccupation(s)\tPhysician, scientist\n\nWilliam Wayne Babcock (born June 10, 1872 in East Worcester, New York; † February 23, 1963) was an American physician and scientist. He developed a method of vein stripping to treat varicose veins.\n\nLife[edit]\n\nBabcock was born on June 10, 1872 in East Worcester, New York and received his medical degree in Baltimore. He received his doctorate in 1893 at the age of 21. He then began training in surgery at St. Mark's Hospital in Salt Lake City, but soon moved to Philadelphia, where he worked in various institutes. In 1903 he became chair of surgery and the head of the Women's Clinic and the Surgical Clinic at Temple University.[1] He held this position until his retirement in 1943. During his medical career, Babcock published more than 350 scientific publications. Babcock was married and had three daughters. He died at the age of 90 on February 23, 1963.[2][3]\n\nBabcock Operation[edit]\n\nAmong other things, Babcock developed a surgical procedure for the surgical removal of the saphenous veins of the legs in cases of varicose veins.[2] This operation was carried out using a probe that is inserted into the vein at the ankle, passed through to the groin and then pulled out of the leg again, with the glans-shaped probe taking the vein along with it. Babcock's method represented an alternative to the surgical procedures common at the time, in which the entire length of the leg was opened.[4] Almost at the same time as Babcock, a method was developed at the Johanniter Hospital in Stendal, Germany that was described by Gotthold Friedel in 1908, in which a circular incision over one and a half meters long was intended to destroy the varix. This became an established practice of the time. In German-speaking countries, the chief physician of the Hamburg Harbor Hospital, Karl Lauenstein, first introduced Babcock's method at the surgeons' congress in Berlin in 1911. The Babcock operation was slow to gain acceptance and was only included in surgical textbooks around 1930.\n\nThe Babcock-Bacon Operation[edit]\n\nDeveloped in collaboration with Dr. Charles M. Bacon, this procedure aimed to treat rectal and sigmoid colon cancer while preserving the anal sphincters. Prior to this technique, radical surgery often resulted in permanent colostomies, significantly impacting patients' quality of life. The Babcock-Bacon operation involved a meticulous dissection and mobilization of the rectum and colon, allowing for resection of the cancerous tissue while preserving the sphincter muscles and blood supply. This innovative approach improved both oncological outcomes and patient well-being, and remains a cornerstone of colorectal cancer surgery today.[2][5]\n\nThe \"Soup Bone\" Cranioplasty Technique[edit]\n\nThis technique, named for its resemblance to the shape of a marrow-filled bone, addressed skull defects resulting from trauma or tumor removal. Babcock pioneered the use of autologous bone grafts, harvested from the patient's own ribs, to reconstruct the missing skull. The curved shape of the rib provided a natural contour for the cranial vault, offering both structural support and aesthetic improvement. The \"soup bone\" technique marked a significant advancement in cranioplasty, offering a safe and effective method for skull reconstruction with minimal donor site morbidity.[2]\n\nNerve Disassociation Technique[edit]\n\nBabcock recognized the role of nerve entrapment and inflammation in contributing to pain and paralysis. He developed a technique for dissecting and separating affected nerves from surrounding tissues, alleviating pressure and promoting nerve recovery. This \"nerve disassociation\" approach proved effective in treating various conditions, including carpal tunnel syndrome, tarsal tunnel syndrome, and meralgia paresthetica. Babcock's technique laid the foundation for modern nerve decompression surgeries, offering relief to patients suffering from chronic pain and sensory disturbances.[6]\n\nInventions[edit]\n\nBabcock invented the Babcock forceps, the Babcock probe, the sump drain, and the lamp chimney sump drain.[2][7][1]\n\nHonors and awards[edit]\n\nBabcock received the American Medical Association Gold Honorary Meritorious Service Medal.[8] In addition, the surgical clinic at Temple University was named after him after his retirement. As early as 1905, a group of students at Temple University inspired by Babcock had formed the Babcock Surgical Society. This society continues to exist today.[9]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b \"Pioneers in Medicine | Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University\". medicine.temple.edu.

It aired in the United States on Fox on December 3, 2023. The episode was directed by Matthew Nastuk and written by Michael Price.\n\nIn this episode, the Simpson family goes to Scotland to find Groundskeeper Willie and learns he is about to be married. Karen Gillan, Paul Higgins, and David Tennant guest star. The episode received positive reviews.\n\nPlot[edit]\n\nAt Springfield Elementary School, the fourth-grade boys are learning to dance with girls. To prevent them from touching hands, Bart goes to the nurse's office to get bandages to wear on their hands. After applying them, they begin to feel intoxicated, and Bart sees that he had obtained nicotine patches. Although he claims innocence, Principal Skinner sends him to Groundskeeper Willie for punishment. When he learns what happened, Willie tells Bart about Maisie, whom Willie loved but did not join Willie in coming to America. They become friendly over their hatred of girls. Meanwhile, Homer and Marge receive an invitation to a destination wedding. Homer protests, but Marge accepts, and they plan to use their accumulated flyer miles to pay for airplane tickets. When Willie goes missing, Bart receives a phone call from him in Edinburgh asking for help. He convinces Homer and Marge to take the family to help Willie with their flyer miles. In Edinburgh, the family finds Willie, who is about to get married to Maisie.\n\nWillie says that his phone call was misleading because it was interrupted by Maisie asking for a kiss. They explain that Maisie's family told her that Willie had been killed by a sheep, which is why she did not join him. She found Willie after she saw a video of him and Bart that they posted online. After talking, they decided to get married. Bart feels betrayed because he thought Willie hated girls. As they participate in wedding activities, Homer and Marge argue because Homer dislikes destination weddings. At the wedding rehearsal, Lisa tells Bart to be happy for Willie while Marge tells people how Homer is not romantic. Although Bart tries to be happy for Willie, he asks Bart to dance with girls, which causes Bart to throw the wedding cake out of a window.\n\nBart hears that Maisie's family is allowing Willie to get married to use his smelling ability to make them rich. Meanwhile, Homer is angry at Marge for talking about him. Later, Homer sends Marge a video that he thinks that she would like. This causes the two to forgive each other. At the wedding, Bart interrupts and tells Willie about Maisie's family's plans. Maisie says she did not know. To prove her love, she breaks Willie's nose to ruin his smelling ability. They get married and move into Willie's shack.\n\nProduction[edit]\n\nKaren Gillan guest starred as Maisie, a love interest for Groundskeeper Willie. She described the character as the role she \"was born to play.\"[1] Gillan previously expressed interest in appearing on the series.[2] Paul Higgins guest starred as Hamish.[3] Higgins also played the Ticket Booth actor.[4] David Tennant was cast as Pa MacWeldon.[5]\n\nThe Scottish band Belle and Sebastian appeared as themselves, playing their song \"If You Find Yourself Caught in Love\" during the wedding activity montage. They also performed the original song \"Willie And The Dream Of Peat Bogs\" over the end credits.[6]\n\nRelease[edit]\n\nThe episode aired live in all time zones in the United States at 8:30 PM ET/5:30 PM PT following a special episode of Krapopolis.[3][7]\n\nReception[edit]\nViewing figures[edit]\n\nThe episode earned a 0.59 rating with 2.04 million viewers, which was the second most-watched show on Fox that night.[8]\n\nCritical reception[edit]\n\nJohn Schwarz of Bubbleblabber gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10. He liked the Scottish jokes and guest stars. However, he thought the subplot of Homer and Marge's marital problems were repeats of previous stories.[9]\n\nCathal Gunning of Screen Rant highlighted Bart's story of being blamed for a prank he unintentionally caused followed by his redemption.[10] He also highlighted the mostly accurate depiction of Edinburgh.[11]\n\nScottish viewers thought that the portrayal of Edinburgh and the Edinburgh Festival Fringe was accurate.[12]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ Lejarraga, Alberto (November 30, 2023). \"Inverness Hollywood star Karen Gillan to play 'role she was born for' in The Simpsons\".

The bridge was budgeted at £3.5M and would have a 45m mast, that tilted and lowered the bridge at the north side of the river. The bridge was due for completion in 2007, but in 2005 the funding was withdrawn for the Thames Gateway Delivery Unit.[3]\n\nIn 2008 SOM designed a new bridge as part of a master plan for the area, and in 2011 it won the planning.[3]\n\nThe bridge was ordered by Ballymore Group.

In 1917, the Reich Treasury established a Statistical Office for War Companies (German: Statistisches Büro für Kriegsgesellschaften) for the purpose of financing companies that had been set up to support the war effort. to balance the surplus and need for money in the war societies. After the war's end, the corresponding assets and liabilities were transferred to a \"cxredit and control entity\" (German: Reichs-Kredit- und Kontrollstelle GmbH), a limited-liability company owned by the German government.\n\nOn 7 March 1923, the government-owned VIAG company founded the Reichs-Kredit-Gesellschaft mbH (private limited company) to take over the Reichs-Kredit- und Kontrollstelle GmbH, and transformed it the next year into a joint-stock company, with Samuel Ritscher [de] as its general manager. The RKG was principally active in the areas of industrial and commercial credit, securities, asset management, and trade finance. In the 1930s it became one of Germany five major banks, even though, similarly as the Berliner Handels-Gesellschaft, it had no branches outside of Berlin.\n\nSee also[edit]\nBerliner Handels-Gesellschaft\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"AK Berlin, Reichs-Kredit-Gesellschaft, Bankgebäude Behrenstrasse 21 /22\".

A longtime studio musician who recorded with Frank Sinatra, Marvin Gaye, The Jackson 5, Steely Dan, and The Beach Boys and many others. He now works as a therapist in Los Angeles. His work with the collective led to participating in the 2008 documentary film titled The Wrecking Crew.\n\nBiography[edit]\n\nColeman was born in Jeanette, Pennsylvania in 1936 and moved to California in 1947. He attended high school in Alhambra. After graduating, Gary entered the Army where he spent a year in Germany in the 5th Infantry Division Band. After returning to the United States with that band, he served a few more months and was given a discharge to attend Los Angeles City College. Coleman transferred to Cal State Los Angeles where he majored in Music Education and Psychology. While teaching music in the public schools for five years, Coleman played in the L.A. Percussion Ensemble, and performed with chamber ensembles in the Monday Evening Concert Series. In 1965, Coleman was given the opportunity through Carol Kaye to enter the recording industry as a percussionist on some projects at Capitol Records. He retired from teaching and continued doing record dates until the late seventies. In the mid-1970s Coleman began a transition into televisions work, primarily with Mike Post, on all his shows. This lasted from the mid-1970s until 1991. Coleman continued his studio career working through the nineties on television and films, primarily with Jerry Goldsmith. Coleman's last few sessions were on the series, \"Family Guy\" with Walter Murphy. He formally retired from session work in 2002.\n\nColeman worked extensively as a studio musician and was part of The Wrecking Crew, performing on the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds (1966), Frank Sinatra's That's Life (1966), the Jackson 5's ABC (1970), John Lennon's \"Stand by Me\" (1975), Tom Waits' Nighthawks at the Diner (1975), and Barbra Streisand's \"Evergreen (Love Theme from A Star Is Born)\" (1976).\n\nHis children, Lisa Coleman (of Prince's band The Revolution, and later of Wendy & Lisa), Daoud and Cole Ynda all worked as professional musicians at some point in their careers.\n\nColeman now works as a psychotherapist.\n\nDiscography[edit]\nThese Boots Are Made for Walkin' – Nancy Sinatra (1965)\nTainted Love – Gloria Jones (1965)\nSpanish Eyes – Al Martino (1965)\nQuincy's Got a Brand New Bag – Quincy Jones (1965)\nWhipped Cream & Other Delights – Herb Alpert (1965)\nUnchained Melody – The Righteous Brothers (1965)\nI Hear a Symphony – The Supremes (1966)\nChér – Cher (1966)\nRay's Moods – Ray Charles (1966)\nPet Sounds – The Beach Boys (1966)\nFrank Sinatra - That's Life (1966)\nIt Must Be Him – Vikki Carr (1967)\nYou've Lost That Lovin' Feelin' – The Righteous Brothers (1967)\nThe Beat Goes On – Sonny & Cher (1967)\nMore of the Monkees – The Monkees (1967)\nMusic from Mission: Impossible – Lalo Schifrin (1967)\nWichita Lineman – Glen Campbell (1968)\nAccent on Africa – Cannonball Adderley (1968)\nSong of Innocence – David Axelrod (1968)\nMore Mission: Impossible – Lalo Schifrin (1968)\nCan't Take My Eyes Off You – Andy Williams (1968)\nMannix – Lalo Schifrin (1969)\nSongs of Experience – David Axelrod (1969)\nJackson 5 ABC (1970)\nPride – David Axelrod (1970)\nRock Messiah – David Axelrod (1971)\nCass Elliot – Cass Elliot (1972)\nCameo – Dusty Springfield (1973)\nThe Way We Were – Barbra Streisand (1973)\nJohn Lennon - Stand by Me (1975)\nTom Waits - Nighthawks at the Diner (1975)\nBarbra Streisand - Evergreen (Love Theme from A Star Is Born) (1976)\nReferences[edit]\nvte\nThe Wrecking Crew\n\nGuitars\t\nJames BurtonGlen CampbellAl CaseyJerry ColeMike DeasyRené HallBarney KesselBill PitmanHoward RobertsLouis SheltonP.

She began music studies in 1914. In 1921, she transferred to the children's department of the Kiev Conservatory.[1] There she enrolled in the piano classes of Konstantin Mikhailov [ru], with whom she studied until 1927.[2] Vakman continued her middle and high school education alongside her musical studies.[1]\n\nA visit to Leningrad, where her older sister lived, led to Vakman becoming enamored with the city,[2] then soon moving there with the rest of her family.[1] She aspired to enroll in the Leningrad Conservatory, which she did in 1928, but was unable to obtain a position in the piano class of Leonid Nikolayev, her first choice. Instead, she became a pupil of Samariy Savinshsky [ru].[2] After graduation in 1932, she continued post-graduate studies with him until 1935. She also began to work as a chamber music partner and accompanist,[1] in the course of which she played with Miron Polyakin and Daniil Shafran.[2]\n\nMaturity[edit]\n\nIllness prevented Vakman from pursuing a career as a soloist. After swimming at a lake in 1934, she contracted a skin disorder which endured for several years, and caused her fingers to feel pain upon touch. As a result, she decided to focus on chamber music and accompanying.[2]\n\nIn 1935, Vakman was hired by the Leningrad Philharmonia. The outbreak of the Great Patriotic War forced her and her husband to relocate to Chkalov, where they joined MALEGOT.[1] From there, she was dispatched to entertain soldiers at the front, where she quickly learned to play accordion. In Chkalov, she played at a local movie theatre, where one of her partners was the cellist Leopold Rostropovich [ru]. After his death, Vakman supported his son, Mstislav, by playing with him in cello and piano recitals. The younger Rostropovich developed an infatuation with Vakman and resolved to study cello harder in order to impress her. He preserved the wrapper from a candy she gave him as a keepsake for the rest of his life.[2]\n\nAfter the war, Vakman returned to Leningrad. In 1944, she worked briefly with the Leningrad State Stage Association [ru], before resuming work with the Leningrad Philharmonia that same year. She left in 1957 to join the All-Russian Touring and Concert Association [ru]. From the 1950s through the 1970s, Vakman performed across the Soviet Union, Eastern Bloc, Europe, the United States, and Latin America. She also was a member of Soviet cultural delegations that were dispatched internationally.[1] However, her energies were primarily directed into teaching after being hired by the Leningrad Conservatory in 1946.[2] She rose through its ranks until attaining the position of professor of chamber music and accompaniment in 1989, a title she held until her death.[1]\n\nLater years and death[edit]\n\nOne of her most important and longstanding artistic collaborations began in the late 1960s, when she became accompanist to the mezzo-soprano Irina Bogacheva. Together they toured internationally and played a wide repertoire. In 1973, they performed the world premiere of Dmitri Shostakovich's Six Poems by Marina Tsvetayeva.[2][1]\n\nVakman's final public concert occurred on November 12, 1994, at the Glinka Hall of the Saint Petersburg Philharmonia.[2] She died in Saint Petersburg on August 12, 2000.[1]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\n\nDuring the early 1930s, Vakman was courted by the conductors Nikolai Rabinovich and Eduard Grikurov. She ultimately married the latter, with whom she remained until his death in 1982.[2] She was the répétiteur for his 1945 production of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Die Zauberflöte.[3]\n\nAwards[edit]\nFor Labor Valor (1945)[1]\nFor the Defense of Leningrad (1946)[1]\nVeteran of Labor (1984)[1]\nOrder of the Badge of Honor (1987)[1]\nReferences[edit]\nNotes[edit]\n^ Old Style: June 29, 1911\nCitations[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d e f g h i j k l m Seliverstova 2019.\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d e f g h i j R. sfn error: multiple targets (2×): CITEREFR (help)\n^ R, I. \"Эдуард Грикуров\".

It relocated to Frankfurt following World War II.\n\nOn 1 January 1970, BHG merged with Frankfurter Bank to form Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank, generally referred to as BHF Bank until 2007 and since then as ODDO BHF.[1]\n\nOverview[edit]\n\nThe foundation of the BHG in 1856 was inspired by the experience of the Crédit Mobilier in France (est. 1852) and its German affiliate the Bank für Handel und Industrie in Darmstadt.[2]: 152  Its founding sponsors included S. Bleichröder, Breest & Gelpcke [de], Bankhaus F. Mart. Magnus [de], Mendelssohn & Co., and Robert Warschauer senior [de].[3]: 167  It was one of the first five joint-stock companies in Germany, following the A. Schaaffhausen'scher Bankverein in Cologne (1848), the Disconto-Gesellschaft in Berlin (1851-1856), the Bank für Handel und Industrie in Darmstadt (1853), and the Mitteldeutsche Creditbank [de] in Meiningen (1856).[4]: 46–47  The BHG was involved early on in securities issuances, particularly by German railway companies.[4]: 75 \n\nIn 1872, the BHG participated in the creation of the Dresdner Bank, as part of a consortium together with Allgemeine Deutsche Credit-Anstalt [de] (Leipzig), Deutsche Vereinsbank [de] (Frankfurt), Deutsche Effecten- und Wechselbank [de] (Frankfurt) and Anglo-Deutsche Bank [de] (Hamburg).[citation needed] That same year it was involved in the creation of Basler Bankverein in Basel.[4]: 451 \n\nIn 1883, Carl Fürstenberg took over the bank's leadership and developed it successfully.[5] Under Fürstenberg's leadership, the bank became increasingly associated with Emil Rathenau and his industrial concern AEG. In 1894, it partnered with other German banks to create the Banca Commerciale Italiana in Milan, and in 1898, the Banque Internationale de Bruxelles.[4]: 451  After World War I, Emil's son Walther Rathenau became the BHG's board chairman.[citation needed]\n\nThe BHG weathered the European banking crisis of 1931 comparatively unscathed, but was severely affected by the takeover of the Nazi Party and by the death of Carl Fürstenberg on 9 February 1933.\n\nAfter World War II, the bank's Berlin head office found itself in the Soviet occupation zone, but the bank was reconstituted in Frankfurt, initially hosted by the Frankfurter Bank until moving to its own location in 1950.[citation needed]\n\nHead office[edit]\n\nThe BHG's head office in Berlin was mostly built in 1897–1900 on a design by architect Alfred Messel, with two main façades respectively on Französische Strasse (south) and Behrensstrasse (north). In 1909–1911, this was complemented by a westward extension on Charlottenstrasse, designed by Messel's fomer associate Heinrich Schweitzer [de].[6] After 1945, the BHG building became part of the head office complex of the Staatsbank der DDR, together with its neighbor on the eastern side, the former head office of Dresdner Bank.

His offspring include Equinox, who is the Japanese Horse of the Year in 2022 and the world's best racehorse in 2023 according to Timeform.[3] His mother, Skia, has won the G3 Prix Fille de l'Air and three other races in France. His half-brother Vin de Garde won the G2 Fuji Stakes as well as finishing 2nd and 3rd in the GI Dubai Turf in 2021 and 2022 respectively. His half-sisters Foteinos and Selenophos each have two wins. His damsire, Motivator, won the Epsom Derby. His maternal grand dam, Light Quest, won one race in France. His maternal grand dam's sire, Quest for Fame, also won the Epsom Derby.\n\nSol Oriens was foaled at the Shadai Farm in Abira, Hokkaido on April 4, 2020. He is currently in training by Takahisa Tezuka. He is currently owned by Shadai Racehorse Co Ltd, an organization that offers stakes in horse ownership (Hitokuchi Banushi; Japanese: 一口馬主) for a total of 60 million yen (150,000 yen per share).[4]\n\nIn November 2021, Sol Oriens suffered a mild fracture in his left hind leg. He was raised at the Shadai Farm until August 2022. Whenever Teruya Yoshida visited the stable, he always asked about his weight as he was concerned about how much it was increasing. Regarding Kitasan Black's offspring, he said, \"Most of them improve gradually as time goes on, it might be better to not run too much as a 2 year old\".[5] His trainer Takahisa Tezuka met him for the first time in May 2021. He said, \"His gait felt springy. I thought the firmness of his muscles were good for an untrained horse.\"[6]\n\nRacing career[edit]\n2022: Two-year old season[edit]\n\nOn September 8, 2022, Sol Oriens passed his gate test at Miho training center.[7] Afterwards, he underwent adjustments at the Yamamoto training center, and returned to his home stable at Miho training center on October 8.[8] He was supposed to debut with Yutaka Take has his jockey[9], but it was changed to Keita Tosaki instead. Before the race, Keita commented, \"His running style seems flexible. He has something good\" and his trainer expressed his hopes, saying, \"He's a horse that I want to ride in the classics\".[10]\n\nSol Oriens made his debut at the Tokyo Racecourse on November 13 in a 2-year-old newcomer race on turf (1800m). Upon leaving the gate, he bumped into the horse next to him and settled in on third position during the race. He won the race by the neck in a fierce battle with Lebensstil. Keita commented, \"He had the ability and has good footwork. He ran the race well. His siblings can be a bit high-strung, but today he was fine. We'll see how he performs with more experience. I believe he has potential.\"[11]\n\n2023: Three-year old season[edit]\n\nSol Oriens was scheduled to run on January 15, 2023 at the Keisei Hai at the Nakayama Racecourse. His jockey, Takeshi Yokoyama, mentioned before the race, \"It seems like it will take some time for him to reach his full potential, but even in graded races, he might deliver some good performance.\" His trainer stated, \"He will run well. I have some concerns about his suitability in Nakayama, but I have no doubts about his running ability.\"[12] He started as the second favorite at the odds of 2.7 on the race day.[13]After the start, he raced in fourth position from the rear during the middle of the race. Making a move around the 3rd and 4th corner, he approached the leading pack. Despite veering outwards, he corrected himself and unleashed his powerful legs in the homestretch, breaking through the rest of the field. He won convincingly by a two and a half lengths with the fastest final 3 furlongs in 34.5 seconds. This marked his second consecutive victory and his first win in a graded stakes race. Additionally, both his trainer and his jockey achieved their first Keisei Hai victories. His jockey commented, \"He tends to lean to the right during training, so I was cautious. Unfortunately, he veered outward, causing inconvenience to other horses. I feel sincerely sorry. I hope he grows both mentally and physically and becomes more considerate of other horses. However, I believe we can expect good things from him for the classics.\" His trainer added, \"He looked like Duramente. While there are many areas to work on, it's clear that he can handle the distance. I think we can proceed to the next race with confidence.\"[14][15][16]\n\nOn February 17, it was announced that Sol Oriens would run directly at the Satsuki Sho (Japanese 2000 Guineas) without using a trial race. The race was scheduled on April 16 at the Nakayama Racecourse.[17] His jockey, Takeshi Yokoyama, mentioned before the race, \"No complaints. His condition is flawless\". His trainer remarked, \"Even though he is popular, I think he is a horse that can live up to that expectation.\"[18] On the day of the race, he was the second favorite at the odds of 5.2, following Phantom Thief at 3.8[19], and track was at its softest since 1989. The race unfolded at a fast pace within the first 1,000 meters clocking in 58.5 seconds. Starting from the innermost gate, he chose to avoid the rough inner part of the track, staying towards the back. Around the fourth corner, he swung widest from second position from the back entering the homestretch. Putting in a strong finishing kick, he overtook Tastiera, who was in a good position forward, winning the race with an undefeated record and claiming his first Grade 1 victory.[20][21][22] It was the first time in history that a horse that used the Keisei Hai as a preparatory race to win in the Satsuki Sho. Winning the Satsuki Sho in his third race since debut is the fewest career starts for a winner. He ran the fastest final 3 furlongs in 35.5 seconds, 0.9 seconds faster than the second placer Phantom Thief, which was a historic difference (the previous record was 0.6 seconds, shared by Narita Taishin and Duramente). The victory, starting from the 17th position around the fourth corner, was the largest comeback win in history (the previous record was Narita Taishin from the 12th position). He was the 20th undefeated horse to win since Efforia in 2021. He was the 4th horse in history to win from the innermost gate, following Yaeno Muteki in 1988, Triple Crown winner Narita Brian in 1994, and Triple Crown winner Contrail in 2020. It's also the first japanese classic victory for Kitasan Black's offspring and the first Satsuki Sho victory for his trainer Takahisa Tezuka.[23] Takeshi Yokoyama expressed, \"The track was bad so I wanted to run on the outside. His initial speed was not as expected when I planned to take a position, but I decided to go with the horse's rhythm. If there was a chance of losing, it might have been due to the pace of the race or if there were stronger horses, but his condition was outstanding, and I was confident from his warm-ups. He's a very good horse.\" He continued, \"Despite riding many good horses regularly, I was not able to achieve good results last year, so I researched everyday, and even then, the results didn't come. Thanks to this horse, I'm really happy to finally achieve good results here. Winning a GI after a long time, there's no greater joy than this. I haven't had good results in the Japanese Derby. Undoubtedly, he should be still improving, so I hope to showcase an improved performance with this horse on the next big stage for everyone.\" His trainer Takahisa Tezuka added, \"It was beyond my imagination and it was amazing. In a few races, he became popular among the fans and have delivered results under unfavorable conditions. I was wondering how he would handle difficult track conditions, but Takeshi rode him skillfully. Since he was the widest and farthest from the back, I didn't know if he would reach the goal in time. He galloped really well.\"[24] Shadai Farm owner Teruya Yoshida said, \"When he drew the innermost gate, I thought it would be tough. His damsire is Motivator, so from the beginning, I saw him as a type that could handle the extended distance and was suitable for the Derby.\" Shadai Racehorse owner Tetsuya Yoshida commented, \"This pedigree is challenging to control, but this horse was relatively calm, so it may have worked out in a positive direction.\"[25]\n\nSol Oriens was registered to the Japanese Derby (Tōkyō Yūshun), and the horse underwent training smoothly without any incidents leading up to the race. On May 25, the gate positions for the derby were announced, and he drew gate number 5. This marked the third instance in the history of graded races where an undefeated horse who won the Satsuki Sho drew gate 5 in the Derby, following Symboli Rudolf in 1984, Deep Impact in 2005, and Contrail in 2020. All three of these horses went on to become undefeated Triple Crown winners, and notably, Contrail also drew gate 1 for the Satsuki Sho.[26] In addition, among the horses that won from gate 5 was the Triple Crown winner Orfevre.[27] The gate position drew a lot of expectations and his winning odds went 1.8, making him the favorite. The race began and he had a great start and positioned himself near the front. The race was led by Pax Ottomanica, who won the Principal Stakes, and set a slow pace as the head of the pack. Sol Oriens positioned himself in mid-pack along the inside, waiting for his moment. In the homestretch, his jockey Takeshi Yokoyama let him off the bridle. With 350m left in the race, they found a path to the outside and made a final charge. In the final stretch, they held off late challengers, Hearts Concerto on the outside and Bellagio Opera, ridden by Takeshi's older brother Kazuo Yokoyama, from the inside. However, they couldn't catch Tastiera, whom Sol Oriens had defeated previously in the Satsuki Sho, finishing in second place, just a neck behind.[28][29] Takeshi Yokoyama, who rode the favorite Efforia, finished second to Shahryar two years ago on the same race. This experience added to the intensity of Takeshi's desire to win the Derby this time. Despite the strong determination he expressed before the race, he fell short of redemption and was instead defeated by the horse he had previously defeated.[30] The owner Shadai Racehorse was also unable to complete the double crown with Isla Bonita back in 2014. After the race, Takeshi Yokoyama expressed his regret, stating, \"I apologize for not living up to being the favorite. There were moments where he showed a tendency to lean inward balance-wise.\" He also mentioned, \"The slow pace affected his ability to show his speed in the stretch. It was really unlucky.\"[28]\n\nRacing statistics[edit]\n\nBelow data is based on data available on JBIS Search,[31] and netkeiba.com.[32]\n\nDate\tRacecourse\tRace\tGrade\tDistance (condition)\tRunner\tBK\tPP\tOdds (Favored)\tFinish\tTime\tDifference\tJockey\t1st Place (2nd Place)\n2022.11.13\tTokyo\tMaiden race\t\tTurf1800m（Firm）\t9\t5\t5\t1.4（1）\t1st\t1:50.8\t0.0\tKeita Tosaki\t（Lebensstil）\n2023.1.15\tNakayama\tKeisei Hai\tGIII\tTurf 2000m（Firm）\t9\t4\t4\t2.7（2）\t1st\t2:02.2\t-0.4\tTakeshi Yokoyama\t（Omega Rich Man）\n4.16\tNakayama\tSatsuki Shō\tGI\tTurf 2000m（Soft）\t18\t1\t1\t5.2（2）\t1st\t2:00.6\t-0.2\tTakeshi Yokoyama\t（Tastiera）\n5.28\tTokyo\tTōkyō Yūshun\tGI\tTurf 2400m（Firm）\t18\t3\t5\t1.8（1）\t2nd\t2:25.2\t0.0\tTakeshi Yokoyama\tTastiera\n9.18\tNakayama\tSt Lite Kinen\tGII\tTurf 2200m（Firm）\t15\t8\t14\t1.6（1）\t2nd\t2:11.7\t0.3\tTakeshi Yokoyama\tLebensstil\n10.22\tKyoto\tKikuka-shō\tGI\tTurf 3000m（Firm）\t17\t7\t14\t2.7（1）\t3rd\t3:04.0\t0.9\tTakeshi Yokoyama\tDurezza\nStatistics as of October 22, 2023\nPedigree[edit]\nPedigree of Sol Oriens[1]\nSire\nKitasan Black\nb. 2012\tBlack Tide\nd.b. 2001\tSunday Silence\tHalo\nWishing Well\nWind in Her Hair\tAlzao\nBurghclere\nSugar Heart\nb. 2005\tSakura Bakushin O\tSakura Yutaka O\nSakura Hagoromo\nOtome Gokoro\tJudge Angelucci\nTizly\nDam\nSkia\nb. 2007\tMotivator\nb. 2002\tMontjeu\tSadler's Wells\nFloripedes\nOut West\tGone West\nChellingoua\nLight Quest\nb. 2000\tQuest for Fame\tRainbow Quest\nAryenne\nGleam of Light\tDanehill\nGold Runner\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d e f g h i j k l m \"Sol Oriens\".

She serves as a bridge between humans and gods in the beliefs of the Pingpu ethnic group. From the documentary, it is learned that she is not a dignified clergyman in Christianity, nor a revered monk in Buddhism. Aunt Li Renji's language and hobbies are approachable, such as when the people do not listen during festivals, Aunt Li will loudly shout out the Three Character Scriptures, or she always keeps smoking due to uncontrollable addiction.\n\nLife[edit]\n\nIn 1919, Li Renji was born in the Jibeishao tribe. [2]\n\nIn 1936, when Li Renji was eighteen, he was selected by \"Ali-zu\" as his subordinate. \"Selected\" means that Alimu will have some connection with the selected person, such as appearing at her window wearing white clothes. , appears in dreams. Li Renji's parents initially opposed Li Renji's role as the concubine. She also resisted and did not understand the rituals of the ceremony. However, she suddenly understood once she went to the grand palace to worship Ali Mu.[2]\n\nBeginning in 1937, Ali Mu appeared theophany for more than two years; during this period, Li Renji only relied on drinking water to maintain normal body function. [2]\n\nIn 1940, Li Renji married Luo Yiji; soon after, the tribe's aunt passed away, and Li Renji began to take over her work. From then on, Li Renji had to \"Poe divination\" to ask Alimu for permission before leaving home. New moon and fifteenth day of each month, he cleaned the Kong-kài, changed the water and green for Alimu's pots and jars, and then offered the Areca catechu and performed the \"three-way ceremony\". On weekdays, Li Renji would also stay at his residence to perform a surprise ceremony for the believers or use a \"thank you basket\" to send a sacrificial vase (the incarnation of Alimu) to various places to \"do things\" for the believers to solve their complicated diseases.[3][4]\n\nIn 1959, Li Renji became a full-time aunt after giving birth to her eighth child.[2]\n\nOld age, Li Renji continued to host important festivals in Jibei, such as the Night Festival and the Roaring Sea Festival (Howling Sea Festival).[2] At 16:00 on February 8, 2001, Li Renji passed away due to myocardial infarctions. [2][5]\n\nFamily[edit]\n\nLi Renji married Luo Yiji and had three sons and five daughters.[1]\n\nAnonymous[edit]\nAlimu's punishment[edit]\n\nIn the early days, the aunt had to go to the Kong-kài's house to change the green (replace the Zelan on the sacrificial pot) on the first and fifteenth day of each month. Once, when the tribe went on a collective trip to the north, Li Renji asked others to clean it up. As a result, he felt unwell in Taipei and was not getting better even after being sent to the hospital. The tribe members quickly took him back to Jibei, and Li Renji was fine as soon as he got on the expressway on the way back. Subsequently, Auntie went to Kaohsiung to deal with the situation at the client's home. After Alimu came to the spirit, she did not start the ceremony directly. Auntie yelled: \"I love playing so much\", and slapped herself for several minutes. It was Alimu who punished and scolded Li Renji. , assistant Li Zhulong quickly apologized and begged Ali's mother, and Li Renji, who was in a spiritual state, stopped slapping himself in the mouth. [6]\n\nPass away[edit]\n\nLegend has it that Li Renji could only live to be seventy-eight years old, but Ali-zu needed her to continue working, so she extended her life by five years. Li Renji had just passed the age of eighty-three. He suddenly collapsed while walking in the courtyard of his residence. This was consistent with what he had said during his lifetime that he would live until eighty-three. Therefore, the tribe members believed that he had completed his mission and was recalled by Ali-zu. As for the succession, Regarding the human issue, Li Renji said: \"It is not up to me to decide who will be my aunt in the future. If Ali's mother wants to find someone, she has to inform heaven and earth to investigate the person's behaviour.\"[7]\n\nPop Culture[edit]\ndocumentary[edit]\n\nMu Zhi·Long Yao, \"Ji Bei Shuo and Ping Pu Grandma\" (2000)\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ a b 陳俊昇 (2001-02-09). \"尪姨李仁記辭世 平埔夜祭失舵手\".\n^ a b c d e f 國立臺灣歷史博物館 (2013). \"西拉雅族 吉貝耍尪姨李仁記\". 觀‧臺灣 (17).\n^ \"財團法人吳舜文新聞獎助基金會\". webcache.googleusercontent.com.

His long career in civil service is distinguishable because it was influenced by the Government of India Act 1935 and the Partition of India 1947, and subsequent division within ICS members.\n\nEarly Life[edit]\n\nManzoor Alam Quraishi was born on 24 July 1917 in Rasra Ballia Uttar Pradesh, India.[1] He was born to parents (Father Bashir Ahmad, Rasra Ballia district Uttar Pradesh) who belonged to the historic local Sunni Muslim community Iraqi Biradari. [2] He was educated at Aligarh Muslim University, receiving the degree, respectively, B.A. (Hon) 1936; M.A. 1938.[3]\n\nCareer[edit]\n\nHe passed the Indian civil service examination that took place in India in 1941. In the same year, he was appointed on probation serving the United Province government as assistant magistrate for a year (and not trained in (London) due to the enactment of Government of India Act 1935. [1]: 306 . After probation he was allowed more time for on-ground administrative experience by serving the United Province Government as Joint Magistrate from 1942-1947. From 1947-1950, he was District Magistrate in Pauri Garhwal. [4] By 1946/1947 the decision of the partition of India into two new countries by the British government based on the opinions of the political parties could not spare division within the prestigious ICS. The members of the ICS community were found to be biased toward the political parties. While most of the Muslim ICSs opted for the newly formed Pakistan, MA Quraishi showed courage and opted for India, governed by the Congress Party. [5] [6]\n\nFrom 1953 to 1957 he worked with the U.P. Government for the betterment of municipalities by amending the existing ‘UTTAR PRADESH MUNICIPALITIES ACT, of 1916’. He was the commissioner of Meerut division, the biggest division in Uttar Pradesh responsible for administering law and order from 1957-1964. He was Chairman of Agro-Industrial Corporation, U.P.; and a member of the Board of Management, Agricultural University, Pantnagar, and the Committee of Panel of Experts on Agricultural Administration.[7] He was selected Indian ambassador to Saudi Arabia (1976-1979, Anexo: Embajadores de India en Arabia Saudita.

These demonstrations occurred as part of a broader movement of war-related protests occurring around the world.\n\nJewish anti-war activists in Israel experienced targeting by far-right mobs.[1] Arab Israelis reported a crackdown on free speech, with individuals arrested for social media posts and likes.[1] By 22 December, sixty-seven percent of Israelis supported a ceasefire.[2]\n\nHostage protests[edit]\nSee also: Kidnapped from Israel\n\nA hostage-solidarity rally in Tel Aviv on 14 October criticized the government's handling of the war and called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resign.[3][4][5][6] Prisoners swaps were broadly supported amongst the Israeli population.[7] The families of hostages were particularly critical of the Netanyahu administration's handling of the war.[8][9] On 4 November, protests were held near Netanyahu's residence.[10][11]\n\nOn 25 November, protesters in Jerusalem called on Netanyahu to resign.[12] A suspected arson-originated fire was reported at a protest camp for the families of hostages; the families experienced harassment from right-wing Netanyahu supporters.[13][14] On 16 December, protesters set up tents outside the Israeli Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv and stated they would not leave until the government took up hostage negotiations again.[15] Protests against Netanyahu on 23 December in Caesarea called for new elections.[16]\n\nAnti-war protests[edit]\n\nOn 9 November, Israeli police arrested former MK Mohammad Barakeh in Nazareth for attempting to organize an anti-war protest.[17][18] In an interview with Time Magazine, Barakeh described Israel's crackdowns on free speech as fascist.[19] On 18 November, Israel held its first permitted anti-war protest in Tel Aviv.[20] Two activists in Haifa were arrested for quietly protesting against the war.[21]\n\nAnti-Arab events[edit]\n\nOn 28 October, a mob of Israelis gathered at Netanya Academic College chanting “death to Arabs” at Palestinian students living in the campus dormitories.[22] On 21 December, activists attempted to block the Kerem Shalom crossing to prevent humanitarian aid from entering the Gaza Strip.[23]\n\nGovernment response[edit]\n\nOn 15 October, communications minister Shlomo Karhi proposed emergency regulations allowing for the arrest of individuals who hurt \"national morale.\"[24] Following a rally in support of Gaza in Haifa, police commissioner Kobi Shabtai threatened to send antiwar protesters to the Gaza Strip on buses.[25] On 8 November, the Israel Supreme Court allowed police to bar all anti-war protests.[26]\n\nThe Knesset criminalized the \"consumption of terrorist materials\" on 8 November.[27] Civil rights groups criticized the bill, stating it \"invades the realm of personal thoughts and beliefs.\"[28] On 2 December, an attorney at Adalah, an Israeli legal center, stated law enforcement was using the law to surveil and silence individuals, while Association for Civil Rights in Israel said it was \"unprecedented in democratic countries.\"[29] On 23 December, The Intercept stated the IDF had barred the media from reporting on eight subjects in Israel.[30]\n\nOn 20 November, the Israeli public broadcasting channel Kan 11 posted and then deleted a video produced by a private NGO, showing children who were evacuated from Gaza envelope settlements singing \"we'll eliminate them all and go back to plowing our fields\".[31] On 23 November, communications minister Shlomo Karhi proposed defunding the newspaper Haaretz due to its \"defeatist and false propaganda.\"[32][33] On 23 November, ahead of the hostage-swap, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir stated that any \"expressions of joy\" related to the release of Palestinian prisoners was \"equivalent to backing terrorism.\"[34] On 29 November, police arrested activists at a Knesset protest opposing the government.[35] Six were arrested on 2 December protesting outside Netanyahu's house in Caesarea.[36][37]\n\nOpen-letters[edit]\n\nSome groups in Israel expressed support for the war. Dozens of rabbis signed a letter to Netanyahu and senior defence officials stating that \"even when the enemy hides behind a human shield... there is no halakhic or moral preclusion, nor legal preclusion, from bombing the enemy after sufficient advance warning\".[38][39]\n\nA group of 100 doctors called \"Doctors for the Rights of Israeli Soldiers\", signed a statement stating Israel had a \"legitimate right\" to bomb \"terror nests and Hamas headquarters in the hospitals in Gaza\".[40] This prompted a harsh reply from the acting head of the ethics office at the Israel Medical Association, Dr. Tami Karni, who wrote that \"doctors are sworn to heal, not kill... Israel's doctors have refused to be dragged into the consciental and moral decline of the enemy, and will continue to act accordingly\". The White Robes, an organization which numbers in the hundreds, decried the letter as a \"provocative pamphlet by an extremist minority\", stating that \"calls for indiscriminate destruction and killing, even if justified militarily, are not part of the medical ethical code\". Physicians for Human Rights published an open letter signed by 350 physicians and medical personnel, which also condemns the aforementioned call.[41][42]\n\nIsraelis abroad[edit]\n\nJews and Israelis abroad participated in protests both supporting and protesting the Israeli response in the war.[43][44]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b Gessen, Masha (8 November 2023). \"Inside the Israeli Crackdown on Speech\".

This change resulted in a series of remarkable successes for the Marathas in Northern India.\n\nSeige[edit]\n\nIn the latter half of November, the Marathas continued their raids, plundering the districts of Etawa, Shikohabad, and Kanauj. Ahmad Khan Bangash suggested paying them off, but Hafiz Rahmat argued that it was better to fight than to give in to their demands. The Marathas continued to recover places in the Doab from Afghan control. At the beginning of December, Ramchandra Ganesh laid siege to Etawah, which had been taken away by the Rohila Pashtuns from the Peshwa's agents before the Battle of Panipat. The fort was then held by Kabir Khan on behalf of Hafiz Rahmat. After a fortnight, Kabir found that resistance was futile as there was no hope of assistance. On December 15th, he surrendered on being granted his life and property. At noon, the Peshwa's flag was hoisted on the ramparts[2], and a Maratha garrison was put in place. Kabir was paid Rs. 50,000 as compensation for the grain and supplies in the fort as well as the arrears of his sebandi troops.[3]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ Brelvi, Altaf Ali (1966).

Then, in the 11th minute, Pécs's manager Antal Botos found himself in a very difficult situation. Alves was given a great start, broke inside the penalty area. Levente Lantos came on and stepped on the striker's heel and he fell. Referee Bede awarded a penalty and the Pécs defender was sent off for denying obvious goal scoring opportunity. The penalty was taken by Goran Vujović, who shooted the ball under the crossbar, Lajos Hegedűs had no chance to save. This gave Fehérvár the lead. After the goal the Fehérvár side took control of the game, Pécs seemed to be affected by the loss of Lantos and the goal. The high pressure paid off in the 25th minute, Ákos Elek went down the left and tried to shoot, but his attempt was flat to the middle and Vujović came on and scored his and his team's second goal from five meters. After that, however, Pécs woke up, regained more possession and played aggressively, although it did not show in big situations. However, the equalizer was not came until the second half. Dávid Wittrédi, took a free kick from 21 metres from and fired the ball into the top left corner into Zsolt Sebők's net. In the 70th minute it was all decided. Dénes Szakály tried a shot from 25 metres out, but his powerful shot was not caught by Lajos Hegedűs, and the ball fell to Illés Sitku, who stepped on it in a great position and then passed for Dániel Nagy. He crossed to the far post and Alison Silva, who was on his own and came on as a substitute, fired into the bottom right corner from 6 metres. Alison could have added to his tally in the 83rd minute. Dániel Nagy curled a free-kick into the middle and Gábor Horváth headed home from 11 metres, but Hegedűs showed great bravery to push the ball onto the post, but it was straight to Alison, who fired over from 5 metres.

In 1924, when he was 11 years old, he entered the Saint Francis of Assisi Minor Seminary in Guangzhou. 1941, he graduated from the Holy Spirit Seminary in British Hong Kong. On September 14 of the same year, Lin Bingliang was ordained a priest in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong at 28.[3]Later, he returned to the Apostolic Vicariate of Guangzhou and served as a senior priest in Guangzhou, Dongguan and Heyuan parishes.\n\nOn October 1, 1949, the Communist Party of China established the People's Republic of China in mainland China and began to carry out religious persecution and suppression of Catholicism. The church was no longer able to function normally. During the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1979, all religious activities in the diocese ceased. In the early 1980s, the Guangzhou Archdiocese resumed operations, and Father Lin Bingliang was appointed the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart of Jesus chief priest.\n\nOn February 15, 1990, promoted by the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association, an organization controlled by the Chinese government and forced by the government, the Archdiocese of Guangzhou elected Lin Bingliang as the bishop of the Archdiocese of Guangzhou without the permission of the Pope. On March 13 of the same year, Ye Yinyun, the illegitimate bishop of the Archdiocese of Guangzhou, passed away. [4]\n\nOn May 6 of the same year, Lin Bingliang was officiated by the illegitimate bishop Joseph Zong Huaide of the Zhoucun Diocese of Shandong Province. The illegitimate bishop Cai Tiyuan the Shantou Diocese of Guangdong and the illegitimate bishop Zhong Quanzhang Xiangli of the Jiaying Diocese illegally self-selected themselves to be ordained pastors. Afterwards, Lin Bingliang was excommunicated because he violated the Canon Code of Canon Law and committed self-consecration without the permission of the then Pope John Paul II.

Scribner, before a spell as a Junior Research Fellow at Churchill College.[3]\n\nCareer[edit]\n\nFrom 1999 to 2005 Hopkin was based at the Department of Economic and Social History, University of Glasgow, as first a lecturer then senior lecturer.\n\nHopkin joined Hertford College, University of Oxford, as Fellow and Tutor in History in 2005. He was made Professor of European Social History in 2017.[3]\n\nResearch[edit]\n\nHopkin has authored and edited five books and numerous research articles. He has been a key collaborator in a number of large-scale historical research projects, including the BEROSE International Encyclopaedia of the Histories of Anthropology.[4]\n\nHopkins's first monograph, Soldier and Peasant in French Popular Culture was praised as the “product of meticulous research and high intelligence, expressed in superb prose”[5] and was jointly awarded the Gladstone Book Prize in 2002.[6]\n\nHis second monograph, Voices of the People in Nineteenth-Century France, was awarded the Folklore Society's Katharine Briggs Prize in 2012.[7]\n\nIn 2016, Hopkin was awarded a Leverhulme Trust Fellowship for the project ‘Lacemakers – Poverty, Religion and Gender in a Transnational Work Culture’, which sought to \"provide the first full length study of the shared work culture of lacemakers across nineteenth-century Europe; a history of women’s experience of poverty constructed from folk songs and stories\".[8]\n\nRecognition[edit]\n\nIn 2023, Hopkin was elected President of the Folklore Society.[9] Hopkin is also a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society.[10]\n\nSelected publications[edit]\n\nHopkin, David M.

On 21 November 2023 he was named coadjutor bishop of the diocese of Fréjus-Toulon.\n\nBiography[edit]\n\nFrançois Touvet was born in Paris on 13 May 1965[1] into a family of navy officers.[2] He is the brother of Laurent Touvet, a senior civil servant, and the brother-in-law of General Pierre de Villiers.[3]\n\nHe attended the Lycée Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague and the Saint-Cyr military academy before studying in England for a year. He entered the seminary of Paray-le-Monial and continued his studies in Besançon and Lyon.[1] After interrupting his studies to fulfill his military service obligations,[4] he obtained his master's degree in theology at the Catholic University of Lyon in 1992.[1]\n\nHe was ordained a priest for the Archdiocese of Dijon on 28 June 1992. He was parochial vicar in Is-sur-Tille until 1996, then part of a team of priests serving the parish complex of Selongey. For years he was religious advisor to the Scouts and Guides of Europe and chaplain to the Unitary Scouts of France. From 1999 to 2004, he was parish priest of Châtillon-sur-Seine and Coteaux-de-Haute-Seine, and from 1996 to 2002 diocesan chaplain of the Eucharistic Youth Movement. He was dean of Val-de-Seine from 2001, and from 2002 he was parish priest of the parish of Montigny-sur-Aube and episcopal vicar for the northern zone of the archdiocese. He was vicar general of the archdiocese of Dijon from 2004 to 2010. He joined the Diocese of Langres in 2010 where he was parish priest of the cathedral and dean of the diocese from 2010 to 2015. He was also episcopal vicar for the southern region of the diocese from 2011 to 2014, then vicar general of the diocese of Langres in 2014-2015, and parish priest of Chaumont in 2015.[1][5] He also served as chaplain to units of the French army from 2011 to 2015.[4]\n\nTouvet in 2014\n\nOn 23 December 2015, Pope Francis appointed him bishop of Châlons.[1] He received his episcopal consecration at Saint-Étienne Cathedral in Châlons-en-Champagne on 28 February 2016[4] from Thierry Jordan, archbishop of Reims, assisted by Gilbert Louis, bishop emeritus of Châlons and Joseph de Metz-Noblat, bishop of Langres.{{cn} He was one of the youngest bishops in France.[6]\n\nWithin the Bishops' Conference of France, Touvet was a member of the Commission for the Liturgy and Pastoral Sacraments from 2017 to 2021 and interim president of the French Association of Pontifical Missionaries in 2020/21. In 2021, he became president of the Council for Communications.[4]\n\nOn 25 June 2022, Cardinal Jozef De Kesel, Archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels, appointed him administrator of the Community of the Word of Life–a community marked by \"spiritual abuse and sexual violence\"[6]–until its dissolution on 30 June 2023.[7]\n\nOn 21 November 2023, he was named coadjutor bishop of the diocese of Fréjus-Toulon. He was assigned most of the authority of an ordinary, rather than the role of an auxiliary which is customary for a coadjutor, specifically \"the special powers of the diocesan government in the areas of administration, management of the clergy, training of seminarians and priests, support of institutes of consecrated life, societies of apostolic life, and associations of the faithful\".[4][6][8]\n\nHe was seated in Toulon on 10 December. He announced an end to the Vatican's restrictions on ordinations in the Diocese.[9]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d e \"Rinunce e nomine, 23.12.2015\" (Press release) (in Italian).

It developed a network of branches in Berlin and its region, reaching 29 locations by 1922.[citation needed]\n\nThe Nationalbank was involved, together with other German banks, in the creation of foreign-oriented ventures such as the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank in Shanghai (1889), and also participated in the restructuring of the former Banca di Genova as Credito Italiano in Rome (1895).[3]: 453 \n\nIn the early 20th century, the Nationalbank für Deutschland attempted to expand into the Ottoman Empire which was increasingly under German influence. In 1904, together with the National Bank of Greece, it established the Banque d'Orient, but sold its shares the next year to France's Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris. In 1905-1906, it participated in the establishment of Berlin-based Deutsche Orientbank (together with Dresdner Bank and A. Schaaffhausen'scher Bankverein), in which it took a 31.25 percent share; the Orientbank in turn took over the branches of the Banque d'Orient in Hamburg and Constantinople.[4]: 72 \n\nIn 1920, Nationalbank für Deutschland merged with the near-synonymous Deutsche Nationalbank, which had been founded in Bremen in 1871 and in 1906 had taken over the Nordwestdeutsche Bank AG.[5]\n\nIts board members included Hjalmar Schacht from 1917 on, and Jakob Goldschmidt from 1918, both of which were also among the bank's influential shareholders.[citation needed]\n\nSee also[edit]\nDresdner Bank\nReferences[edit]\n^ Manfred Pohl (1981), \"Die Geschichte der Nationalbank für Deutschland\", Bankhistorisches Archiv\n^ Detlef Krause (2010), Commerzbank: Eine Zeitreise 1870-2010 (PDF), Dresden: Eugen-Gutmann-Gesellschaft\n^ Jacob Riesser (1911), The German Great Banks and Their Concentration in connection with The Economic Development of Germany (PDF), Washington DC: National Monetary Commission\n^ Monica Pohle Fraser (2016), East Meets West - Banking, Commerce and Investment in the Ottoman Empire, Routledge\n^ \"Deutsche Nationalbank\".
