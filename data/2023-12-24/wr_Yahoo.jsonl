There are very good reasons for this, as you'll learn below. But the company is expecting an incredible improvement in earnings in 2024. Assuming it can live up to this forecast, the stock could be in for a big rebound, too. Here's what you need to know.During the coronavirus pandemic, demand for the tools that Stanley Black & Decker produces was quite strong. It makes sense: People stuck at home took on home improvement projects to enhance their living experience. Adjusted earnings in 2021 rose 30% versus 2020 and hit a record of $10.48 per share. As 2022 got underway, the company was projecting adjusted annual earnings to come in between $12.00 and $12.50 per share, which would have been yet another record result.That didn't exactly play out as expected. Instead, Stanley Black & Decker posted adjusted earnings of $4.62 per share. That was more than a 50% decline. It isn't hard to understand why investors might have found that upsetting after the company set much higher expectations. Things have only gotten worse in 2023, with management now expecting full-year adjusted earnings to be in the range of $1.10 to $1.40 per share. That would be another huge decline and helps explain the stock price malaise.The backstory for this weak performance is equally as troubling. High leverage, slowing sales, and weak margins were all contributing factors. But Stanley Black & Decker has been working to get back on track by reducing leverage, cutting costs, and raising prices, among other things. The improvements are already starting to show up in the company's earnings.Stanley Black & Decker is an industrial giant and you can't turn a ship like this around on a dime. It takes time, but slow and steady progress has been on clear display. For example, the company's adjusted gross margin has climbed each quarter since hitting a low point in Q4 2022. The improvement is huge, too, with adjusted gross margin rising from roughly 20% to 28%.Meanwhile, the Dividend King (it has increased its dividend for 56 consecutive years) entered 2023 expecting adjusted earnings to be between zero and $2.00 per share. That's been narrowed to $1.10 to $1.40 per share, which tells you that the worst-case scenario didn't even come close to transpiring. Sure, the top end got lowered, but the real risk for investors was that the bottom fell out of the business, and that just didn't happen.Meanwhile, looking out to 2024, Stanley Black & Decker has reiterated its earlier guidance for adjusted earnings of between $4.00 and $5.00 per share. That was a target used to justify the company's turnaround plans, so it would be reasonable to expect that management was being aggressive. But the business is well into that turnaround plan and it is still supporting the range, which is a very good sign.So 2023 looks like it will be the nadir for earnings, which is worth noting. But the real takeaway is probably the improvement that will come about in 2024, if management can hit the targeted adjusted earnings range. Assuming the company can earn $1.40 per share in 2023, the high end of the projected range, adjusted earnings will increase by 285% in 2024 if it only hits the low end of expectations ($4.00). The high end -- $5.00 -- would lead to a 350% jump in adjusted earnings. Wall Street will likely change its view of Stanley Black & Decker in a very positive way if either of those scenarios plays out.Should you invest $1,000 in Stanley Black & Decker right now?Before you buy stock in Stanley Black & Decker, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Stanley Black & Decker wasn't one of them.

There are far too many stocks that offer extraordinary yields of 6% or more -- a level that I'd categorize as ultra-high.Granted, some of those stocks are too risky for many investors. But not all of them are problematic. Here are my four favorite ultra-high-yield dividend stocks to buy for 2024 (listed in alphabetical order).Ares Capital (NASDAQ: ARCC) ranks as the largest publicly traded business development company (BDC). To be exempt from paying federal taxes, BDCs must return at least 90% of their income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Ares Capital has generated a lot of earnings to return in this manner: Its dividend yield currently tops 9.8%.Can Ares Capital sustain its dividend at such an ultra-high level? I think so. The company continues to generate strong earnings. It also has a great track record of 14+ years of stable to increasing dividends.What I especially like about Ares Capital is that it has consistently delivered higher total returns than the S&P 500 over the long term. Middle-market companies' need for capital combined with Ares Capital's solid risk-management process should enable this stock to keep up its winning ways in the future.Energy Transfer's (NYSE: ET) corporate tag line is \"moving America's energy.\" That's exactly what the company does with its nearly 125,000 miles of pipeline. The limited partnership also moves quite a bit of money to its partners via quarterly distributions. Energy Transfer's distribution yield is over 9.1%.Those distributions should continue to flow and grow. Energy Transfer expects to increase its distribution by between 3% and 5% per year. The midstream energy leader is generating more than enough cash flow to fund the distributions.I'm not overly concerned that Energy Transfer's solid gains this year will prevent it from keeping the momentum going in the new year. The U.S. economy appears to be in good shape heading into 2024. Energy Transfer's valuation also remains attractive with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of under 8.3.I also really like another midstream energy stock -- Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD). The company operates over 50,000 miles of pipelines that transport crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, petrochemicals, and other refined products.Enterprise's distribution yield currently stands just shy of 7.7%. What's really impressive, though, is that the company has increased its distribution for 25 consecutive years with a compound annual growth rate of 7%.An additional big plus for Enterprise Products Partners is its consistency. The company has generated double-digit returns on invested capital (ROIC) and strong cash flow per unit during both boom and bust periods.Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) is no doubt the best-known of these dividend stocks. It's a leader in the telecommunications industry with operations around the world. Verizon has also been a stock that income investors have loved for years. With the company's dividend yield of over 7.1%, income investors still love Verizon.There are two main reasons why I included Verizon on the list of my four favorite ultra-high-yield dividend stocks. One is its track record of dividend increases. In September, Verizon announced its 17th consecutive year of dividend hikes.The second is that the company's free cash flow continues to grow robustly, which should ensure those dividend increases keep coming. Just as important, this trend shows that Verizon can successfully navigate a challenging telecom market. I think this is an ultra-high-yield dividend stock that's built for the long term.Should you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now?Before you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Verizon Communications wasn't one of them.

After shedding 35% of its value last year, the Nasdaq Composite has come roaring back, soaring 42% through late December.There's more good news. Going back to 1972 -- the first full year the Nasdaq traded -- in every year after a market recovery, the tech-heavy index has continued its upward trend, rising 19%, on average, which suggests that 2024 will be another good year for investors.One of the hottest exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this year has been Cathie Wood's Ark Innovation fund, generating returns of 68%. One of Ark's most eye-catching calls is that Roku stock will reach $605 by 2026, representing upside of 547% compared to its recent closing price. The bull case is even more mind-boggling, suggesting the stock could soar to $1,493, representing gains of 1,496%.There's no doubt the stock has a great deal of upside potential but what is the likelihood that Roku will surpass Ark's lofty benchmark? Let's take a look at the available evidence.The investment thesis for Roku is simple. It is the most widely used streaming platform in the world, controlling 51% of the market, according to a report released by data analytics provider Pixalate. This marks the company's strongest showing and deepest market penetration since early 2020.Roku's user-friendly system offers a wide variety of streaming options, including dongles, set-top boxes, the Roku operating system -- which is being adopted by many TV manufacturers -- and Roku-branded connected TVs, which gives the company a strong foundation for further growth.The secular decline in cable television also benefits Roku. The industry lost a record 5.9 million subscribers in 2022, according to Leichtman Research Group, and has already shed 4.9 million through the first nine months of 2023. As the leading streaming video platform, Roku offers a compelling alternative for cable defectors, many of whom will turn to streaming for their -n-home entertainment.Roku's audience is highly engaged, with bodes well for the company's digital advertising. In the third quarter, Roku's active accounts grew 16% year over year to 75.8 million. At the same time, streaming hours rose 22% to 26.7 billion. That works out to an average of 3.9 hours per account per day, up from 3.7 hours in the year-ago quarter. Multiple viewers across 76 million active accounts represents a compelling opportunity for marketers, fueling the expansion of advertising on Roku's platform.There's one other secular tailwind that should help drive Roku's growth: the ongoing deterioration of broadcast television. Advertisers are well aware of this trend and marketing dollars are following the audience. Ad spending on traditional broadcast TV fell 23% year over year in the third quarter, according to Standard Media Index (via MarketingDive). At the same time, spending on connected TVs and streaming video services increased 39%.In summary, Roku's industry-leading streaming platform, the secular decline of broadcast television and cable, and the ongoing shift in ad dollars should all fuel Roku's future success.Ark released its Roku valuation model in July 2022, suggesting three potential stock price outcomes by 2026:Bear case: $100, implying upside of 7%.Base case: $605, implying upside of 547%.Bull case: $1,493, implying upside of 1,496%.A number of variables feed into the predicted outcomes, with the biggest contributor being the success (or failure) of the digital advertising shown on Roku's platform and the revenue the company generates by 2026:Bear case: Revenue of $3.6 billion.Base case: Revenue of $14.4 billion.Bull case: Revenue of $32.1 billion.The fly in the ointment, of course, is the downturn, which ground Roku's growth to a halt. Revenue grew just 13% to $3.1 billion in 2022 and revenue is up just 10% during the first nine months of 2023, so Roku is already playing catchup. The improving economy is already driving a rebound in digital advertising -- which makes up the lion's share of Roku's revenue.Analysts' consensus estimates are calling for revenue of $3.4 billion this year, $3.8 billion next year, and $4.4 billion by 2025. Balancing Ark's revenue expectations against those of other analysts, Roku will probably exceed the bear case, but it seems highly unlikely it will come anywhere near the base case. So what are investors to do?Keep in mind that Ark's estimates are just that, and the macroeconomic headwinds of the past couple of years plagued the broader market -- not just Roku. Looking ahead, it's entirely possible that Roku will be able to achieve Ark's base case, it might just take a few more years.Given the events of the past couple of years, it strains logic to suggest that Roku stock would climb 1,496% over the coming three years. In fact, I think it's a stretch to suggest the stock will reach Ark's base case and rise 547% by 2026 -- though its certainly possible and stranger things have happened.That said, consider these salient points:Roku is the worldwide streaming leader, and penetration is increasing.Cord-cutting, the secular decline of broadcast TV, and the ongoing adoption of streaming are trends that all favor Roku.Digital advertising, which was hit hard by the downturn, is finally beginning to rebound.These factors all point to a bright future for Roku. Furthermore, there's another compelling reason to buy Roku right now: its valuation. The stock is currently selling for roughly 3 times next year's sales, well below the three-year average of 11 and still near its lowest valuation ever.Given the available evidence, I would suggest Roku stock is a buy, even if it doesn't reach Ark's lofty expectations any time soon.Should you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?Before you buy stock in Roku, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Roku wasn't one of them.

I was told I do not have to withdraw my money if I am still employed. Please confirm if this in fact an IRS rule or that of the fund management company?-BeaThat is correct, Bea. If you are still employed, you do not have to take a required minimum distribution (RMD) from your current 401(k) regardless of your age, as long as your employer doesn’t require it. That is in fact an IRS rule.RMD requirements depend on your age, the account type and whether or not you are still employed. There have been some changes to these rules recently, so let's review the minimum distribution requirements. (And if you need help with retirement planning, including RMDs, consider speaking with a financial advisor.)The IRS won’t let you leave your retirement savings in tax-deferred accounts indefinitely. Instead, the government requires you to withdraw a certain amount of money from your accounts each year. How much you’re mandated to withdraw is based on your age and how much money was in your account at the end of the previous year.Before the SECURE Act of 2019, RMDs started at age 70 ½. However, the law increased the RMD age to 72.That increase was short-lived, though. The SECURE Act 2.0 raised the RMD age to 73 beginning in 2023 and set it to increase to 75 in 2033.You are required to take an RMD from most tax-advantaged retirement accounts with the exception of Roth IRAs.Under prior law, designated Roth accounts within employer-sponsored plans like Roth 401(k)s and Roth 403(b)s were still subject to RMD rules. However, the SECURE Act 2.0 addressed this shortcoming, and beginning in 2024 no Roth accounts will be subject to age-based RMDs. I specify \"age-based\" here to acknowledge the fact that inherited Roth accounts are still subject to the 10-year rule. (And if you have other retirement-related questions, this tool can help match you with potential financial advisors.)Here lies the exception that applies to you. If you are still employed then you don’t have to take RMDs from the plan that your current employer sponsors.However, even if you are still working then you must still take RMDs from:IRA accounts, including SIMPLE and SEP IRAsOther retirement plans in which you are no longer an active participantSo, if you have a 401(k) from a former employer, you’ll need to make sure that you’re taking RMDs from that account. A good workaround for avoiding RMDs for an old account is to simply roll those funds over into your current plan if you are allowed. (And if you need help planning your RMDs, consider working with a financial advisor.)Since you are still employed, you are not required to take an RMD from your current employer’s retirement plan. RMDs also don’t apply to Roth accounts. However, you still need to take an RMD if you still have a retirement account from a former employer.Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be hard. SmartAsset's free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have free introductory calls with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you.

But the decision by the Federal Reserve Bank to pause its interest rate increases has many on Wall Street now calling for a so-called soft landing -- or getting inflation under control without causing a recession.There's more good news. While the Nasdaq Composite has already gained 43% so far this year (as of market close on Thursday), history suggests there's more to come. Over the past 51 years, in the year following a market recovery, the Nasdaq has surged an additional 19% on average, which suggests there's likely more gains to come.Leading the pack this year have been the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Each has deep ties to artificial intelligence (AI) and all have outpaced the broader market by a country mile:Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA): Up 235%Meta Platforms: Up 194%Tesla: Up 107%Amazon: Up 83%Microsoft: Up 59%Alphabet: Up 56%Apple: Up 50%Wall Street rarely agrees on anything, but most market watchers agree that one of the Magnificent Seven is best situated to profit from the rapid adoption of AI: Nvidia. While the stock has already soared so far this year, the evidence suggests it could outperform over the longer term -- and the stock isn't as expensive as you might think.It's worth stepping back for a minute to look at the big picture. While AI represents a massive opportunity for Nvidia, it's far from the only one. The company first introduced the modern graphics processing unit (GPU) 25 years ago, which transformed the video game market by rendering lifelike images, replacing the boxy figures gamers had come to expect. Nvidia has parlayed that early success into a dominant share of the discrete desktop GPU space, recently controlling more than 80% of the market, according to Jon Peddie Research (via Tom's Hardware).Over the years, the secret to Nvidia's success has been its ability to adapt its technology to new and lucrative use cases. This all hinges on parallel processing, or the ability to break up massive computing jobs into smaller, more manageable pieces.The company soon discovered that the ability to process a multitude of complex mathematical calculations could be used in other computationally demanding use cases. Nvidia quickly developed solutions for a wide range of these applications, including cloud computing, data centers, autonomous driving, and most recently AI. Furthermore, by relentlessly improving its technology and including software that makes its processors work even more efficiently, Nvidia created an economic moat that it maintains to this day.The ability to pivot and constantly develop new use cases has helped fuel the stock's relentless climb higher, having gained 12,380% over the past 10 years. That's also why AI is just the latest in a long line of breakthroughs fostered by Nvidia's technology and why its processors are the gold standard in a wide variety of these use cases.You need only examine Nvidia's results to understand the degree of its importance in the advent of AI. In Nvidia's fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29), the company generated record revenue of $18.1 billion, up 206% year over year, while its diluted earnings per share of $3.71 surged 1,274%. Investors shouldn't expect results of that magnitude to continue, as the results are skewed by last year's downturn. But it does help illustrate the accelerating demand for Nvidia's groundbreaking AI chips.The company expects the current tidal wave of growth to continue. For its upcoming fiscal fourth quarter, Nvidia is forecasting record revenue of $20 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, which would represent an increase of 230% year over year. Management left no doubt that AI was behind its bullish outlook.Estimates vary widely, so there's simply no way to know for sure how big the market for AI will ultimately grow, yet even the more conservative estimates are eye-catching. The Generative AI market could grow to $1.3 trillion by 2032, achieving a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.Nvidia was already the undisputed leader in machine learning (an earlier branch of AI) with 95% of that market, according to New Street Research.As the leading provider of AI solutions of all kinds, Nvidia has the most to gain from this secular tailwind.AI isn't the only potential growth driver.There has been an uncharacteristic growth slump in the gaming market, the result of economic headwinds, but they are abating. The global gaming GPU market is expected increase from $2.7 billion this year to $11.7 billion by 2028, a CAGR of 34%, according to market researcher Mordor Intelligence. As the industry leader, Nvidia will also ride this wave higher.The adoption of cloud computing shows no signs of slowing, as businesses shift an increasing number of workloads to the cloud. All that information has to go somewhere, which is fueling greater investment in data centers -- and the need for increased capacity and performance will only grow as more companies integrate AI into their operations. This, in turn, will fuel a data center upgrade cycle. Estimates suggest that Nvidia has a 95% share of the GPUs used by the data center market, according to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino.Furthermore, the data center market will continue expanding and is expected to grow from $263 billion last year to $603 billion by 2030, a CAGR of 11%, according to Prescient and Strategic Intelligence Market Research. This helps illustrate another large and profitable opportunity for Nvidia.As the leading provider of processing solutions for gaming, cloud computing, data centers, and AI, the future is bright for Nvidia -- and its investors.Let's talk about the elephant in the room, Nvidia's valuation. The stock is currently selling for 65 times earnings and 27 times sales, which might seem outrageous at first glance. But it fails to capture an important factor: growth. As previously mentioned, the company has generated two successive quarters of triple-digit growth, which skews those metrics to the upside, making the stock look extraordinarily expensive.However, the highly appropriate price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) -- which takes that growth into account -- is less than 1, compared to more than 2 for the S&P 500, which shows how cheap the stock really is.There's little question the accelerating demand for generative AI will continue well into the future. Add to that Nvidia's dominant position in gaming, data centers, and machine learning, and it's clear Nvidia is the Magnificent Seven stock to buy in 2024 if you can only buy one.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Wall Street's three major stock indexes have ping-ponged between bull and bear markets on a couple of occasions over the past four years, with the growth-focused Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) gyrating the most.As of the closing bell on Dec. 20, the Nasdaq Composite had rallied 41% year to date and nearly 45% from its 2022 bear market closing low of 10,213.29 on Dec. 28, 2022. Nevertheless, the Nasdaq remains 8% below its record-closing high, which was set in November 2021.Short-term traders are likely to view the past 25 months as a lost period for growth stocks. But for patient investors who lean on time as an ally, dips in the Nasdaq Composite are nothing more than red-carpet opportunities to pounce on great companies at a discount.What follows are four colossal growth stocks you'll regret not buying in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market dip.The first industry juggernaut that's begging to be bought with the Nasdaq Composite still meaningfully below its record-closing high is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent company of popular internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and autonomous-vehicle company Waymo, among other ventures.The best argument I can muster for why Alphabet isn't taking out its record high right now is because investors are worried about a recession in 2024. A couple of economic data points and predictive tools indicate that a downturn is likely in the new year. Since Alphabet generated 78% of its sales from advertising during the September-ended quarter, there's a very real likelihood that economic weakness would sap ad spending and some of its ad pricing power (at least temporarily).But the U.S. economy is a two-way street that very much favors optimists. While the typical recession lasts for less than a year, most periods of economic growth since the end of World War II have endured for multiple years, if not a full decade. More often than not, Alphabet is enjoying incredible ad-pricing power.Furthermore, Google is a virtual monopoly in internet search. It held 91.54% of global search in November, per GlobalStats, and has been responsible for at least a 90% monthly share of worldwide search looking back more than eight years. This absolute dominance for Alphabet's foundational operating segment makes it the logical choice for advertisers wanting to target potential customers.Cloud infrastructure service provider Google Cloud is no slouch, either. Enterprise cloud spending can sustain a double-digit growth rate for a long time to come. Additionally, Google Cloud has turned in three consecutive quarters of operating profit following years of losses.Among the widely owned FAANG stocks, Alphabet is one of the cheapest. Shares can currently be purchased for around 14x forward-year cash flow, which is well below the 18x cash flow it's averaged over the previous five years.A second colossal growth stock you'll regret not adding to your portfolio following the Nasdaq bear market decline is China-based e-commerce behemoth Alibaba (NYSE: BABA).Let me state upfront that China stocks come with added regulatory/oversight risks. For instance, Alibaba was fined a record $2.75 billion in 2021 by Chinese regulators for its anti-monopoly practices. There was also a period of time in 2022 where China stocks were at risk of delisting from major U.S. exchanges if Chinese companies didn't allow U.S. regulators access to three years of audited financial statements. While these issues are now in the rearview mirror, they're a reminder of why China stocks usually have lower price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios than U.S.-based stocks.Nevertheless, there are plenty of reasons to be excited about Alibaba's future. For starters, China is still in the process of bouncing back following the COVID-19 pandemic. The country's stringent and unpredictable lockdowns wreaked havoc on supply chains. Given that China's e-commerce industry is still in its early stages of ramping up, there's a long growth runway in front of Alibaba as China's economy regains its footing.To add to the above, Alibaba dominates the e-commerce space. Data from the International Trade Administration pegs Alibaba's online shopping sites Taobao and Tmall as collectively accounting for almost 51% of China's e-commerce share.Don't overlook Alibaba's leading cloud services segment, either. According to Canalys, Alibaba accounted for more than a third of cloud infrastructure services spending in China during the March-ended quarter. This is another sustained double-digit growth opportunity.Alibaba stock can be purchased right now for 7x forward-year earnings, or closer to 5x forward-year earnings if you back out its more than $77 billion in net cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and equity securities. That's dirt cheap for an industry leader!The third tremendous growth stock you'll regret not scooping up following the Nasdaq bear market swoon is online-services marketplace Fiverr International (NYSE: FVRR).Shares of Fiverr have retraced more than 90% from their all-time high, which was set during a period of investment euphoria that occurred in 2021. The company's at-the-time nosebleed valuation, coupled with the aforementioned prospect of weaker economic growth, have worked together to push Fiverr's shares notably lower. But after a more than two-year downtrend, Fiverr's stock looks like a steal.One factor clearly working in its favor is the permanent shift we've witnessed in the labor market. Though some workers have returned to the office with the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic now in the rearview mirror, more people have chosen to remain remote than ever before. This is music to the ears of a freelancer-driven platform like Fiverr that connects mobile workers with businesses that need their services.Another reason Fiverr should have no trouble standing out is the company's unique online-services marketplace. Whereas most of its competitors allow freelancers to market their tasks on an hourly basis, Fiverr freelancers are pricing their jobs as an all-in cost. The price transparency offered on Fiverr's platform is unmatched, and it's likely played a key role in continuously increasing spend per buyer.But the top selling point for this fast-growing small-cap stock is its take rate -- i.e., the percentage of each deal negotiated on its platform, including fees, that it gets to keep. While the take rate for its top competitors is in the mid-to-high teens, Fiverr's take rate in the September-ended quarter expanded to 31.3%. Fiverr is continually netting more from each deal without driving away its freelancers or buyers.A forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12 is a phenomenal deal for a company capable of doubling its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) many times over in the years to come.The fourth colossal growth stock you'll regret not buying in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market dip is none other than fintech leader PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL).Similar to Fiverr, PayPal's stock has been clobbered since hitting a record high in 2021. Shares dropped more than 80% as fears of a recession picked up and the prevailing U.S. inflation rate soared.The latter is particularly worrisome for digital payment networks. Above-average inflation has the potential to reduce the discretionary spending power of low earners. That would be bad news for fee-driven platforms like PayPal.Despite these concerns, total payment volume (TPV) traversing PayPal's networks has continued to grow by a low-double-digit percentage on a currency-neutral basis. Given that digital payment adoption is still in its early stages, it's an encouraging sign that PayPal's year-over-year TPV growth could reapproach 20% during long-winded periods of economic expansion.PayPal's user engagement data is even more encouraging than its steady growth in TPV. When the curtain closed on 2020, active PayPal accounts averaged 40.9 transactions over the trailing-12-month (TTM) period. But as of Sept. 30, 2023, the company's active accounts are now averaging 56.6 transactions over the TTM. Since PayPal generates most of its revenue from fees, steady growth in usage from its active customers is a recipe for higher gross profit.On the opposite end of the spectrum, newly appointed CEO Alex Chriss aims to stamp out operating inefficiencies and increase shareholder value. PayPal is aiming for at least $1.3 billion in cost savings in 2023 and is on track to repurchase approximately $5 billion worth of its common stock this year. This should lift the company's operating margin and boost its EPS.A forward P/E ratio of 11 for a company Wall Street expects to grow its EPS by 18% on an annualized basis over the next five years is too cheap to pass up.Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

{"date": "2023-12-24-21-22", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/history-says-nasdaq-surge-2024-122000999.html", "text_blocks": "Investors generally agree that 2022 will go down in history as a challenging one for the markets, but it appears the worst has passed. After falling more than 35% in 2022 -- the worst decline in more than a decade -- the Nasdaq Composite charged off the blocks in 2023, gaining 41% so far this year (as of market close on Wednesday).Students of investing history will know the market likely has further to run. Going back to 1972 -- the first full year of trading for the Nasdaq -- in each year following a bear market rebound, the tech-centric index has climbed 19% on average, which suggests the current uptrend has room to run.Furthermore, the recent revival of stock splits has investors poring over companies that have split their shares in recent years, as this is normally preceded by years of robust growth. Let's look at two companies that meet the criteria and should be on investors' short lists.One company that should be on investors' radars is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG). The stock has gained 415% over the past 10 years, causing the company to initiate a 20-for-1 stock split in mid-2022. Despite the challenges it faced over the past couple of years, Alphabet has a history of robust financial growth, and 2024 will likely prove to be more of the same.The biggest challenge in 2022 was the steep and rapid decline in online advertising, which generates the lion's share of Google's revenue, but the industry appears to have turned the corner.Digital advertising is expected to grow 11% in 2023, according to advertising strategist Madison and Wall. Alphabet is the online advertising leader, controlling roughly 30% of the worldwide market, according to data collated by online marketing trade publication Digiday. As such, Alphabet is well positioned to ride that tailwind higher.Global cloud infrastructure spending is rebounding, up 16% to $73.5 billion in the third quarter, according to research company Canalys. During the same period, Google Cloud revenue climbed 24% year over year, achieving a market share of 10%. This is Alphabet's second most important growth driver, so the ongoing rebound is a welcome development.Furthermore, Alphabet was quick to pounce on the opportunity represented by generative artificial intelligence (AI), which brings with it the promise of greater productivity for its users. As one of the \"Big Three\" cloud providers, Google Cloud offers the perfect venue to offer AI services to its cloud customers.Speaking of AI, Alphabet has also been quick to infuse many of its most popular products and services with AI functionality and recently released its Gemini AI, which outperforms ChatGPT using a variety of widely used benchmarks.The recovery of digital advertising fueled by its industry-leading search, a rebound in cloud computing, and the opportunity represented by AI provides a compelling case for Alphabet. Here's another reason to buy: The stock is currently selling for 5 times forward sales, a significant discount to its three-year average of 6 times sales. That suggests Alphabet is a bargain when viewed through the lens of its large and growing opportunity.Another stock-split stock investors should have on their shortlist is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The stock has surged 12,420% over the past decade, causing the company to initiate a stock split in mid-2021. And there looks to be much more where that came from.Nvidia pioneered graphics processing units (GPUs), which render realistic images in video games, but that was just the beginning. As a result, Nvidia has long been the leader in the discrete desktop GPU space, with more than 80% of the market.But that was just the beginning. CEO Jensen Huang realized the significant potential to expand the use cases of parallel processing by the GPU, which can conduct a multitude of complex mathematical computations simultaneously. Parallel processing also proved the be a perfect match for the rigorous computational horsepower needs of data centers, helping speed data through the ether. By some accounts, Nvidia controls as much as 95% of the market for data center GPUs, according to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino.With the dawn of AI, Nvidia was able to pivot quickly, offering not only the processors necessary to get the job done, but also the accompanying software that make them work seamlessly. That gave the company the lead in machine learning, an earlier branch of AI. Nvidia controls as much as 95% of that market, according to New Street Research.Generative AI represented another test for Nvidia, and the company showed that it was more than up to the challenge. Nvidia just released the HGX H200, specifically designed for the rigors of generative AI and high-performance computing (HPC). Nvidia says the processor delivers \"nearly double the capacity and 2.4x more bandwidth compared with its predecessor, the Nvidia A100.\"The data center upgrade cycle and the accelerating demand for AI have supercharged Nvidia's results so far this year. For its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29), data center revenue -- which includes processors used for AI -- soared 279% year over year to a record $14.5 billion, and management believes another record-setting quarter is coming due to the persistent demand for AI.Many investors cite Nvidia's lofty valuation of 63 times earnings and 27 times sales as a reason to avoid the stock -- that those metrics fail to take the company's triple-digit growth into account. However, the more appropriate price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) -- which takes that into account -- comes in at less than 1, compared to more than 2 for the S&P 500, showing that Nvidia is extraordinarily cheap compared to its prospects.Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

{"date": "2023-12-24-21-22", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/prediction-3-warren-buffett-stocks-105000486.html", "text_blocks": "I've never heard Warren Buffett predict which stocks in Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio will deliver the greatest gains over the next year. He's called the Oracle of Omaha, but even Buffett knows that such near-term predictions usually fall short.But I'm about to give it a shot anyway. I fully realize the folly of attempting something that Buffett wouldn't do. However, I nonetheless predict that three of the stocks he owns will be his biggest winners in 2024. Here are those stocks (listed in alphabetical order), along with why I have great expectations for each one.American Express (NYSE: AXP) emerged as one of Buffett's best-performing stocks this year. Shares of the financial services giant were in negative territory as recently as October. However, a fourth-quarter surge now has the stock on track to finish 2023 up more than 25%.I think that AmEx's momentum will continue into the new year. Why? For one thing, business is booming. The company reported its sixth consecutive quarter of record revenue in the third quarter. Its earnings per share soared 34% year over year to an all-time high.Macroeconomic factors also appear to bode well for American Express in 2024. Inflation, although still higher than the Federal Reserve would like it to be, has moderated considerably. Unemployment levels are low historically. And the prospects for the Fed to cut interest rates next year appear to be pretty good.These should be tailwinds for other Berkshire holdings as well, notably including payment processing leaders Mastercard and Visa. However, I picked American Express as a likely bigger winner in large part because of its low valuation. Its shares currently trade at less than 14.8 times expected earnings.D.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI) has been an even more impressive winner for Buffett this year than American Express. Shares of the homebuilder have skyrocketed by nearly 70%. As was the case with AmEx, most of those gains came in the final two and a half months of the year.I predict D.R. Horton will be one of the best Buffett stocks of the new year for a couple of reasons. The first ties in with the macroeconomic factors that should help American Express. In particular, I think that the potential for interest rate cuts could boost home sales, especially in the second half of 2024.The second is that there's still an acute housing shortage in this country. Bank of America published a paper a few months ago that stated the U.S. needs another 4 million houses.D.R. Horton is uniquely positioned to benefit from lower interest rates and the need for more housing. It's the largest homebuilder by volume in the country, a distinction it has held since 2002. The company operates in 33 states.What's more, the stock is cheap -- especially considering the company's growth prospects. D.R. Horton's price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is a low 0.64.Unlike American Express and D.R. Horton, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) hasn't been a great stock for Buffett in 2023. However, I think that sets the stage for a much better performance in 2024.First of all, Occidental's valuation is attractive. Its shares trade at only 11.3 times expected earnings. I suspect this will entice Buffett to buy even more of the stock in 2024. Berkshire secured regulatory approval to acquire up to 50% of the company's shares. So far, it has bought 27.2%.I think there's a real possibility that Berkshire will aggressively add to its stake in Occidental in the coming months. If this happens, it could ignite a broader buying frenzy that pushes the stock price much higher.Of course, Occidental's fortunes hinge on oil prices. However, Goldman Sachs projects that Brent crude will hit $85 per barrel by mid-2024. That's higher than the current price of a little under $77 per barrel. If Goldman Sachs is right, Occidental should be in good shape in 2024 -- and so should Buffett.Should you invest $1,000 in Occidental Petroleum right now?Before you buy stock in Occidental Petroleum, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Occidental Petroleum wasn't one of them.

They supply their owners with passive income. On top of that, they've historically delivered market-beating total returns.Investors who like dividends are usually on the lookout for another income producer to add to their portfolios. Southern Company (NYSE: SO), Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE: BAM), and Darden Restaurants (NYSE: DRI) are three top-notch dividend stocks that income seekers should love because they offer higher-yielding payouts that should grow in the future. That makes them seem like great income stocks to buy and hold for the long haul.Southern Company currently offers a 4%-yielding dividend. That's more than twice the S&P 500's dividend yield (recently around 1.5%).The utility has a long history of paying dividends and has paid one equal to or greater than the prior-quarter's level for 75 years. Meanwhile, 2023 marked the 22nd consecutive year it has increased its dividend.Southern Company has plenty of power to continue growing its dividend, too. The company has invested over $10 billion to build two new nuclear power-generating units (Vogtle 3 and 4). The third unit entered service earlier this year, while unit four should begin commercial operations early next year.Southern Company estimates these plants will produce $700 million in annual operating cash flow. That will give it more money to invest in expanding its utility business (including building out its Southern Power renewable energy platform) and increasing its dividend.Brookfield Asset Management currently pays a 3.2%-yielding dividend. The leading global alternative asset manager has big plans to grow its payout.The company expects to grow fee-related earnings by 15% to 20% annually over the next several years. It plans to pay out 90%+ of those recurring earnings in dividends, implying it should increase its dividend at a similar rate.Brookfield aims to grow its fee-bearing capital base to more than $1 trillion by 2028, more than double its $440 million of fee-bearing assets under management (AUM) at the end of the third quarter. That should more than double its fee-related earnings by 2028 (growing them from $2.2 billion to $4.8 billion).Brookfield's ability to raise bigger flagship funds and launch new funds drives that growth outlook. For example, it recently raised a record $30 billion for its latest flagship infrastructure fund (Brookfield Infrastructure Fund V). That was 40% larger than the prior fund (BIF IV) and exceeded its $25 billion target.Brookfield also recently launched its first Catalytic Transition Fund (targeting sustainable investments in emerging and development markets) and its second Global Transition Fund. These and other new funds will grow Brookfield's fee-related earnings, enabling it to rapidly increase its dividend.Darden Restaurants currently offers a 3.2% dividend yield. The restaurant operator has steadily increased its dividend over the years. While the company cut it in 2020 due to the pandemic's impact on its operations, it brought the payment back to its pre-pandemic level in 2021 and has grown its rate over the past few years. The company gave its investors an 8% raise earlier this year.The restaurant operator should continue growing its dividend in the future. It's continuing to expand its restaurant count and same-store sales, giving it more cash to pay dividends, and plans to open 50 new restaurants in fiscal 2024 while growing same-store sales by 2.5% to 3.5%.In addition to organic growth, Darden recently acquired Ruth's Hospitality Group in a $715 million deal. The transaction added 154 Ruth's Chris locations. The company expects the deal will boost its earnings per share in fiscal 2024 while adding another concept to its growing menu of restaurants, positioning it for more organic growth.Southern Company, Brookfield Asset Management, and Darden Restaurants offer dividend yields that are more than double the rate of the S&P 500. On top of that, these companies should increase those payouts in the future. That makes them great options for investors who like dividends since these companies should supply a growing income stream with the potential to produce market-beating total returns.Should you invest $1,000 in Southern Company right now?Before you buy stock in Southern Company, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Southern Company wasn't one of them.

This isn't surprising. Whenever there's a new technology, it's natural to see investors clamor to figure out who the winners will be. Now that consumer-facing products utilize generative AI models like ChatGPT and Bard, the race is on to see what stocks will be winners in this new world of AI.But AI was around long before 2023 and many companies have been focusing on AI for years, making their use cases less unknown than some newer AI-focused start-ups. However, there are also many companies suddenly talking about AI when in reality it's not a material part of their business.Let's take a look at three stocks with true long-term AI tailwinds that make them great stocks to buy and hold.The conversation needs to start with chip designer Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The AI mania surrounding Nvidia began when the company reported its fiscal 2024 second-quarter earnings (ended July 30, 2023). Total revenue, which was expected to be $11 billion, came in at $14 billion. This represented a year-over-year increase of 101%. This surprise in total revenue was driven by data center revenue, which increased by 171%. The data center growth was a result of chips needed for large tech companies to power their generative AI efforts. The good news for Nvidia has continued from there.This trend is expected to continue into the fourth quarter, with total revenue expected to increase by more than 200% year over year. As exciting as this has been for Nvidia shareholders, potential investors may want to exercise some patience. Nvidia stock is priced as if this growth will never slow. The stock trades for 66 times trailing earnings. There's a chance that the growth continues enough to make an investment today work out, but it may be prudent to wait a bit until the stock cools off a bit more.This is a cyclical industry and it's likely better valuations will present themselves in the future. Even if the AI hype wears off, Nvidia has a diversified business and has seen massive success in other areas like gaming and automotive. This company is poised for success in the long run.As mentioned earlier, the AI buzz started when ChatGPT was launched for consumers in November 2022. ChatGPT was developed by a private company called OpenAI, but tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is a significant investor in OpenAI. While the billions of dollars it provided to the company doesn't give Microsoft any ownership of OpenAI, it does smooth the way for ChatGPT to be integrated into Microsoft products. The first example of this is Microsoft's browser, Bing. However, the company plans to integrate generative AI into multiple products.If the promise of AI pans out, this could be a significant development for a company like Microsoft, which has a massive market share with products like Microsoft Word and Excel. Adding AI to these products could make them more attractive and sticky for users. There's been an impact on Microsoft's Azure Cloud business as its customers increase demand for AI services.Microsoft currently trades at a premium valuation of 36 times trailing earnings, above the market average and the company's historical multiple. That said, the company does seem to have a lead in the AI space so some premium is to be expected.Not to be left out, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has developed its own generative AI product, Bard. The parent company of Google is integrating Bard into several of its products like Gmail, YouTube, and Google Maps. If the promise of AI is to be believed, there is room for several winners in this space, and it's easy to imagine a world where Alphabet has AI fully integrated into its products. This could help the company maintain its dominant market position in the future.Luckily for investors, there are plenty of things to like about Alphabet's businesses even without AI. Google is by far the leader in search while YouTube plays a dominant role in online. Its cloud infrastructure platform Google Cloud grew revenue by 22% in Q3 2024. These business segments have helped Alphabet's stock increase by 56% in 2023.Even better for potential investors is the fact that Alphabet still trades for a reasonable valuation. The company's price-to-earnings multiple of 27 is only slightly above the S&P 500's multiple of 25 and still below Alphabet's historical average of 30.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

{"date": "2023-12-24-21-22", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/where-palantir-stock-10-years-150000195.html", "text_blocks": "Three years ago, data analytics company Palantir (NYSE: PLTR) debuted on public markets through a direct listing. Since then, its shares have risen around 80%, with most of that growth coming from a recovery in 2023 as investors became more optimistic in its ability to incorporate new generative artificial intelligence (AI) tech into its business model. Let's explore what the next 10 years could have in store for the company.Palantir is an American software company known for data fusion and mining, a process that involves analyzing a large volume of information and combining data from different sources into useful insights. The company is unique because of its significant exposure to sensitive government clients and missions.According to CNBC, Palantir's software helped the U.S. find Osama Bin Laden in 2011. And it is currently used to help the Ukrainian armed forces with targeting in the war with Russia.So far, Palantir's business is performing reasonably well. Third-quarter earnings grew 17% year over year to $558 million, with the fastest growth coming from its commercial clients, which increased 23% to $251 million -- a bit under half of the total. Public sector deals represented the rest.While Palantir's government contracts give its business stability and a solid niche (not every company is trusted to deal with such classified and sensitive information), commercial clients could represent a significant potential growth opportunity in the future. Management is rapidly incorporating generative AI into its business model to make its software solutions more useful to potential enterprise clients.Generative AI is a unique subfield of artificial intelligence where algorithms are designed to create new content based on vast arrays of training data. While this is distinct from Palantir's legacy data management businesses, the two technologies synergize well. For example, generative AI could help automate Palantir's analytics process or give clients real-time conversational insights about their data in fast-paced scenarios like battlefields or law enforcement operations.In April, Palantir launched its new Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), designed to add AI to its existing software offerings like Gotham, which is for government uses, and Foundry, geared toward the private sector.Bloomberg Intelligence expects the total generative AI market to be worth a jaw-dropping $1.3 trillion by 2032, with a significant portion of the opportunity coming from software. Over the next 10 years, investors can expect Palantir's AI efforts to become a key growth driver as the technology improves and more organizations implement it into their operations. Palantir's public sector relationships and existing data mining business could give it an edge against potential rivals that may emerge.Valuation will also be a big concern for long-term Palantir investors. With a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 61, the company trades at a substantial premium to the S&P 500's average of 26. But the price looks somewhat justified by the company's solid bottom-line momentum.Third-quarter net income jumped from a loss of $123.9 million to a gain of $80 million, capping off Palantir's first four consecutive quarters of profitability under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The company's burgeoning profitability and cash flow could give it a stable foundation for its AI expansion over the coming years.

However, the beginning of a new year can psychologically feel like the best time of all to put money to work in new ways.There are thousands of dividend stocks from which you can choose. Some are better than others, though. Here are three no-brainer dividend stocks to buy in 2024.Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) is a leader in the midstream energy industry. It operates more than 50,000 miles of pipelines, as well as other midstream assets such as natural gas processing plants and storage facilities.What most other companies would call a dividend, limited partnerships such as Enterprise refer to as a distribution. At its current share price, Enterprise's distribution yield is a sky-high 7.6%. Even better, the company has increased its distributions for 25 consecutive years. And it appears to be in a great position to keep that streak going in 2024.Many stocks are priced at a premium as the current year winds down. Not Enterprise Products Partners. It trades at a modest forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9.9.No one knows for sure what 2024 will bring. The good news for shareholders of Enterprise Products Partners is that it's resilient in good times and bad times. Since 2005, the company has never delivered a return on invested capital of less than 10% -- not even during the 2008-2009 financial crisis or the COVID-19 pandemic.U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) ranks as one of the top super-regional banks in the U.S. It had $668 billion in assets as of Sept. 30, and serves millions of customers. Fortune magazine named U.S. Bancorp as one of the most admired super-regional banks of 2023.Unfortunately, investors didn't find a lot to admire about U.S. Bancorp stock throughout much of 2023. At one point, its shares were down more than 30% year to date due to the fallout of the regional banking crisis. However, U.S. Bancorp stock has rebounded nicely and is now in positive territory for the year.Its dividend remains attractive, with a yield of more than 4.4% at the current stock price. U.S. Bancorp recently increased its payout, and given its reasonable payout ratio of 57%, I expect it will continue to deliver modest hikes in the future.With shares trading at 10.3 times forward earnings, U.S. Bancorp stock is still a bargain. The company has a strong balance sheet, and the credit quality of its loans is improving. The further we get from the banking crisis of early 2023, the better this stock's prospects should be.Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) is a telecom giant with wireless and broadband customers across the world. The company was created in 2000 via the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE, two of the biggest telecom leaders at that time.Income investors have liked Verizon for years -- and still do. Its dividend yield tops 7% at the current share price, and management has increased the payout for 17 consecutive years.The stock is continuing to make a major comeback after sinking by more than 20% earlier in 2023. Verizon's better-than-expected third-quarter results provided a strong catalyst. Investors were especially encouraged by the company's improved free cash flow.Even with its big bounce late this year, Verizon's valuation remains attractive. Shares trade at only 8.1 times expected earnings. With a new streaming bundle option for subscribers featuring Netflix and Max, the stock could have plenty of room to run in 2024.Should you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now?Before you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Verizon Communications wasn't one of them.

{"date": "2023-12-24-21-22", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/once-generation-investment-opportunity-1-101500242.html", "text_blocks": "Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates says artificial intelligence (AI) is the most revolutionary technology he has seen in decades. He formed that opinion after watching ChatGPT ace a college-level biology exam that included open-ended essay questions. Gates shared his thoughts in a recent blog post:The development of AI is as fundamental as the creation of the microprocessor, the personal computer, the internet, and the mobile phone. It will change the way people work, learn, travel, get healthcare, and communicate with each other. Entire industries will reorient around it. Businesses will distinguish themselves by how well they use it.Take a moment to consider how profoundly those technologies changed the world, as well as the wealth they created in the process. Such inflection points come along rarely, and many experts (including Gates) believe AI is the next one. The best way for investors to capitalize on that once-in-a-generation opportunity is to build a basket of AI stocks.Here's why Cloudflare (NYSE: NET) belongs in that basket.To understand why Cloudflare should benefit from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, investors must first know what the company does and how it compares to peers. The short answer is that Cloudflare makes the internet faster and safer. The longer answer is that it provides a broad range of application, network, security, and developer services that accelerate and protect corporate software and infrastructure.Cloudflare has differentiated itself through performance and scale. It operates the fastest cloud network and developer platform on the market, and it handles about 20% of internet traffic. Its platform is also cloud neutral, meaning it improves performance and security across public clouds and private data centers. That makes Cloudflare a useful partner even for businesses that rely on other cloud providers like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.The upshot of its unmatched performance is that Cloudflare has established a strong presence in several cloud computing verticals, including developer services. Forrester Research recently recognized Cloudflare as the leader in edge development platforms, citing a superior product (i.e., Cloudflare Workers) and a stronger growth strategy compared to other vendors.Management believes that its value proposition for developers -- unmatched speed and cloud-neutral technology -- will make Cloudflare a key part of the AI value chain. The company is leaning into that opportunity. It recently announced Workers AI, a service that allows businesses to build AI applications and run machine learning models on its network. Workers AI is accelerated by Nvidia GPUs and supported by other Cloudflare products like R2 (object storage) and Vectorize (vector database).It may be a few years before those innovations become meaningful revenue streams, but the company is very optimistic. CEO Matthew Prince says that \"Cloudflare is the most common cloud provider used by the leading AI companies.\" He also believes Cloudflare is \"uniquely positioned to become a leader in AI inferencing,\" a market that represents the biggest opportunity in AI.Beyond developer services, Cloudflare also has a strong presence in several cybersecurity markets. Forrester Research recently named the company a leader in email security, and the International Data Corp. recognized its leadership in zero trust network access.One reason for that success is the data advantage created by its immense scale. As previously mentioned, about 20% of internet traffic flows across the Cloudflare network. That gives the company deep insight into performance issues and security threats across the web, and it uses that information to continuously route traffic more efficiently and counter threats more effectively.Cloudflare brings together network and security services with Cloudflare One, a secure access service edge (SASE) platform that protects and connects users to private applications, public cloud services, and the open internet. Cloudflare One addresses the widespread push to modernize network security. Consultancy Gartner believes 80% of enterprises will adopt SASE architecture by 2025, up from 20% in 2021.Cloudflare values its addressable market at $164 billion in 2024, but sees that figure surpassing $200 billion by 2026. Developer services and network security services account for most of that total. Cloudflare already has a strong presence in both markets, meaning the company is well positioned for future growth.Indeed, Cloudflare ranked No. 6 on the Fortune Future 50 List for 2023, an annual assessment of the world's largest companies based on long-term growth prospects. Making the list at all is an achievement, but taking sixth place is a testament to the company's tremendous potential. The authors attributed Cloudflare's high placement to opportunities in AI inferencing and cybersecurity.With that in mind, analysts at Morningstar expect the company to grow revenue by 34% annually over the next five years, a reasonable estimate given that revenue increased by 46% annually during the past three years. In that context, the stock's current valuation of 23.5 times sales looks reasonable, and it's certainly a discount to the three-year average of 38.7 times sales.That said, Cloudflare is not cheap and its share price will likely be volatile. But patient investors comfortable with price swings should feel confident in buying a small position in this growth stock today, especially as part of a broader basket of AI stocks.Should you invest $1,000 in Cloudflare right now?Before you buy stock in Cloudflare, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Cloudflare wasn't one of them.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) reached new all-time highs in mid-December. The S&P 500 is within spitting distance of its own record level, and the Nasdaq Composite isn't far off.If you've remained invested in the stock market throughout the past few years, then 2023 has provided more proof of what history has said countless times before: After bear markets and other significant market downturns, stocks have always recovered and rewarded long-term investors. But for many who lost confidence in stocks during 2022's bear market, 2023 has been frustrating, because it has shown how selling stocks at their lows can ultimately prove counterproductive.Regardless of whether you have a stock-heavy portfolio or are just now thinking about investing in stocks, a look back at the past can reveal a lot about what the best strategy is when stocks are at all-time highs. It's not complicated, and many long-term investors will find that they don't have to change a thing about what they're doing in order to remain successful well into the future.When you look back at past bull markets, you can see that on many occasions, stocks continue to gain ground even after they've made big moves to return to all-time highs. After the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, it took the S&P 500 until March 2013 to surpass its old high from 2007 and hit new record levels. Some investors suggested that after such an impressive recovery, it would be smart to take some money off the table.Yet what happened after that was a nearly seven-year run of success, with the S&P continuing to rise and set records consistently on dozens of occasions between that first new all-time high and early 2020. By the end, the index had more than doubled from its record close in March 2013.The same thing happened after the lightning bear market at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. After plunging in February and March 2020, markets recovered quickly, and the S&P returned to record levels that August. Again, some felt it prudent to reduce stock exposure at that point, yet the S&P climbed another 40% between August 2020 and January 2022 before the most recent bear market began.Admittedly, there have been occasions when stocks recovered to record levels just to fall again. After the tech bubble burst in 2000 through 2002, it took the market seven years to reach new records. Yet the S&P only rose another few percent before the financial crisis took hold.With history as background, there are several things to consider with markets at all-time highs. The right way to approach things right now depends a lot on your particular situation.If you still have a long time horizon before you'll need the money that you're investing, then there's little reason to pay attention to the ups and downs of the market. Keep saving and consistently invest more into stocks, and you'll benefit from what have historically been superior returns.If it took all your discipline to avoid selling stocks at 2022's bear market lows, then pat yourself on the back for having outlasted the downturn. However, look critically at your asset allocation. Did you overestimate your ability to weather a severe bear market? If so, consider a more conservative investing approach. That doesn't mean selling all your stocks right away, but it could mean shifting a percentage out of the market into other asset classes like bonds and cash.Similarly, if you're retired and have been spending down your cash cushion in order to avoid having to sell stocks at lows, then now's a good time to consider replenishing your cash reserves. Again, you don't necessarily want to sell a huge amount right now, but taking steps to give yourself the balance you want is essential for the success of your long-term strategy.On the other hand, if you've been out of the market, you might think now's the worst time to invest. Yet the smart move is still to make some stock purchases, perhaps through a dollar-cost averaging strategy that ensures all of your money won't go in at the absolute top if a market downturn is on the way.Lastly, bear in mind that just because the Dow Jones and other indexes are at or near all-time highs, many individual stocks remain far below their record levels. Indeed, it's the very fact that many stocks are still playing catch-up at the end of a bear market that often keeps driving market indexes higher.All-time highs are exciting, but they shouldn't have a huge impact on your investing. By keeping an even keel and not letting headlines affect you too much, you'll be in a better position to reap the true rewards that await those with a long-term investing mindset.When our analyst team has an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

Barring a stunning late December collapse, the stock market will deliver hefty gains in 2023.The big question now is: Can the momentum continue into the new year? For those who look to the past to try to discern what might happen in the future, there could be an intriguing answer to that question. The S&P 500 is poised to do something it's only done three times ever. Here's what history says it could mean for stocks in 2024.Standard Statistics Company, which later merged with Poor's Publishing to form Standard & Poor's (now S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI)), first created a stock market index of U.S. companies back in the 1920s. However, the S&P 500 in its current form with 500 companies dates back to 1957.During its 66-year history, the S&P 500 has delivered positive annual gains roughly 70% of the time. Down years aren't unusual, but positive years are much more common. What is rare, though, is for the S&P 500 to experience a large decline in one year followed by a huge gain in the following year.From 1957 through 2022, the S&P 500 fell by 15% or more five times. The index rebounded by 15% or more in the following year only three times. The most recent example was in 2008 and 2009 with the stock market crash and subsequent comeback. Now, this rare occurrence appears to be about to happen again. The S&P plunged 19% in 2022 but is set to finish 2023 up more than 20%.Even if we look at the indexes that were predecessors to the modern S&P 500, such steep declines followed by significant bounces are infrequent. There have been only five previous times since the 1920s when the S&P 500 and its previous versions fell by 15% or more, then rose by 15% or more in the next year.So has the S&P 500 been like a yo-yo in the past -- falling, rising, then falling again? Nope. Let's look at how the index has performed in the year following a big rebound.In 2008, the S&P 500 plunged over 38% with markets roiled by the financial crisis. The next year, it bounced back by more than 23%. That momentum continued, albeit at a moderated pace, in 2010 with the S&P rising nearly 13%.It was a similar story early in the 21st century. The S&P 500 fell 23% in 2002 in the continued aftermath of the dot-com bubble bursting. In 2003, the index roared back with a 26% jump. The S&P rose more in 2004, but with a smaller gain of close to 9%.The same pattern emerged during the 1970s. In 1974, the S&P 500 plummeted nearly 30%. It rebounded by almost 32% in the next year. The index then rose another 19% in 1976 -- a strong but smaller gain.If history is a guide, we could see the same thing happen in 2024. The S&P 500 could continue its positive momentum in the new year but deliver a performance that isn't as impressive as that of 2023.Unfortunately, there's no guarantee that history will repeat itself. From a statistical standpoint, the trends from the past are virtually meaningless because of the low sample size.Granted, some Wall Street analysts think that the S&P 500 will rise, but at a more modest rate, next year. For example, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) analysts set a target price for the index of 5,000, reflecting an increase of nearly 6% from its current level. Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) expects the S&P 500 to hit 5,100 next year, a gain of nearly 8%. No one knows for sure what the stock market will do over the next year, though.The good news is that long-term investors don't have to be concerned about it. Over a long period, the S&P 500 almost always goes up. As Warren Buffett once stated: \"In aggregate, American business has done wonderfully over time and will continue to do so (though, most assuredly, in unpredictable fits and starts).\" Whatever happens in 2024, the long-term outlook for the stock market should be bright.When our analyst team has an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

They supply your portfolio with a base income return every year. Meanwhile, the best ones can also deliver meaningful stock price appreciation as the underlying company grows its earnings and dividend payments.NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) are elite dividend stocks. They've increased their dividends every year for decades, and that steady growth should continue in the decades to come. That makes them great dividend stocks to buy for a potential lifetime of income.NextEra Energy has increased its dividend payment annually for more than a quarter century. The utility has delivered above-average dividend growth in recent years, powered by its renewable energy investments. The company has grown its adjusted earnings per share at a 9.8% compound annual rate since 2012 while increasing its dividend at an even more impressive 11% compound annual rate. Its payout currently yields 3.2%, more than double the S&P 500's 1.5% dividend yield. Since 2000, the utility has produced a 14.2% annualized total return, double the S&P 500's 7% annualized return.The clean energy-focused utility should be able to continue growing its payout in the future. NextEra Energy generates very stable cash flow backed by regulated rate structures and long-term contracts. That gives it the steady cash to pay dividends and invest in expanding its operations. The company has one of the most conservative dividend payout ratios in the utility sector. It also has one of the industry's strongest credit ratings. That gives it lots of financial flexibility to grow its dividend and operations.The company expects to grow earnings at or near the upper end of its 6% to 8% annual target range through 2026. Meanwhile, it sees dividend growth of at least 10% per share through next year. The company's large and growing backlog of renewable energy development projects and investments to expand its utility in Florida will power its growth in the coming years.NextEra sees tremendous growth prospects beyond 2026. The company estimates that the U.S. economy will need to invest $4 trillion to fully decarbonize by 2050 with renewables, hydrogen, and other clean energy sources. As a leader in clean energy, it should be able to capitalize on this massive opportunity to continue growing its earnings and dividends in the decades to come.Johnson & Johnson has been a phenomenal dividend stock over the years. The healthcare giant has increased its payout for 61 straight years. That puts it in the elite group of Dividend Kings, companies with 50 or more years of dividend growth. The company's growing dividend has driven healthy total returns. Its 7.8% annualized total return since 2000 has outpaced the S&P 500's 7% average annual total return.The company's dividend, which currently yields 3.1%, is on a very healthy foundation. Johnson & Johnson is a financial fortress. It has an AAA bond rating, tied for the highest in the world. The company has a cash-rich balance sheet and a cash-gushing business model. It ended the third quarter with $24 billion in cash against $30 billion in debt.Meanwhile, it has produced $12 billion in free cash flow through the third quarter of this year, even after investing $10.6 billion in research and development (R&D). That easily covered its $8.9 billion in dividend payments, enabling the company to repurchase $2.5 billion in shares.Johnson & Johnson expects its R&D investments to help drive healthy revenue and cash-flow growth in the coming years. It sees its operational sales growing by 5% to 6% next year while rising at a 5% to 7% compound annual rate through 2030. That should drive similar earnings-per-share growth with strong free-cash-flow generation.The company can enhance its growth by using its strong balance sheet to make strategic acquisitions. Johnson & Johnson recently agreed to acquire Laminar for $400 million and paid $16.6 billion to buy Abiomed in late 2022. Both of those deals bolstered its MedTech business. The company has the financial strength to plug holes in its drug pipeline and MedTech product offerings to enhance its long-term growth rates.NextEra Energy and Johnson & Johnson have stood the test of time. They have increased their dividend payments every year for decades. That should continue in the future, given their strong financial profiles and the growth they still have ahead. That puts them in a strong position to supply their investors with a lifetime of dividend income.Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and NextEra Energy wasn't one of them.

But a consensus won't be reached until the index logs a new all-time high. Here's the good news: It only has to gain another 0.5% to get there.With that in mind, history suggests 2024 is almost certain to be another positive year for the S&P 500, which would all but guarantee a new bull market by every definition. Here's why investors might want to welcome the new year with shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD).Google was founded in 1998, and it came public in 2004 valued at $23 billion. It began trading under Alphabet in 2015 because the company had essentially become a conglomerate, following several acquisitions like YouTube and Waymo, and the important internal expansion into cloud computing.Today, Alphabet is worth nearly $1.8 trillion, and that incredible value creation prompted management to execute two stock splits since 2014 to ensure its stock remained accessible to small investors. Those investors might be thankful this year, because Alphabet gained 60%, which is more than twice the return of the S&P 500 -- and 2024 could be another strong year.Google search remains Alphabet's largest source of revenue. It struggled over the last 18 months with a challenging economic environment, but with interest rates poised to fall next year, businesses will likely ramp up their advertising spending once again. That could reignite Google's search revenue and drive growth for Alphabet overall.But artificial intelligence (AI) has been another challenge. Alphabet entered 2023 on the back foot as Microsoft acquired a $10 billion stake in leading start-up OpenAI. Microsoft immediately integrated ChatGPT into its Bing search engine, and it threatened to change the way people find information on the internet -- prompting a chatbot and receiving direct answers is far more convenient than sifting through web pages.But Alphabet rose to the occasion and launched its own chatbot called Bard. It also embedded AI into the traditional Google search experience, and users will now find the information they seek at the top of the search results without having to click through to any web pages. But December marked Alphabet's biggest leap forward in AI so far with the release of its new Gemini model.Gemini's multimodal capabilities -- like creating and understanding text, images, videos, and computer code -- appear to outperform OpenAI's latest GPT-4 models, according to statistics released by Alphabet. It could be a game changer for the company, especially for Google Cloud because it faces fierce competition from the highly successful Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service, and Amazon Web Services, which features a growing number of models.But valuation might be the biggest story for Alphabet heading into the new year. The company is on track to deliver $5.74 in earnings per share for 2023, and based on its stock price of $140.42, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 24. That's a 17% discount to the Nasdaq-100 technology index, and it's also 32% cheaper than Microsoft's P/E of 36. I think Alphabet has the pedigree to trade alongside its AI rival, so investors might enjoy another year of strong upside in 2024.Advanced Micro Devices was founded in 1969, and it went public in 1972. Its stock has since delivered a blockbuster gain of 24,150%, prompting management to execute six stock splits since 1978 to ensure it remains accessible to smaller investors. But it could be set for substantial gains going forward, too, as it races to catch its rival Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) in the race to develop AI data center chips.AMD is one of the largest chip companies in the world. Its hardware powers some of the most popular consumer electronics, including the Sony PlayStation 5, which just crossed 50 million units sold. AMD's chips can also be found in the infotainment centers inside Tesla's electric vehicles. But the company's largest-ever opportunity will likely be in the data center.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says there is $1 trillion worth of existing data center infrastructure that needs upgrading to support accelerated computing and AI. His company has a dominant share in that market thanks to its powerful H100 graphics processor (GPU) and the upcoming H200. But AMD is launching a challenge with its new lineup of data center chips designed for AI workloads, called the MI300.It comes in a few configurations; the MI300X is a pure GPU, whereas the MI300A combines GPU and central processor (CPU) chips to create the world's first accelerated processing unit (APU) for data centers. AMD has already started shipping the MI300A to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for its new El Capitan supercomputer, which is expected to be the most powerful in the world when it comes online next year.In fact, 2024 could be the biggest year ever for AMD's data center segment, because it expects to exceed $2 billion in sales from GPUs alone.AMD delivered a lackluster financial performance in 2023, as consumers spent less on computers and devices under the weight of high inflation and rising interest rates. But Wall Street is forecasting $3.73 in earnings per share in 2024, representing 40% growth at the bottom line. That would place AMD stock at a forward P/E ratio of 37.4, which is a premium to the current 29.6 P/E of the Nasdaq-100.However, AMD estimates the market for its AI data center chips will grow to $400 billion by 2027, so next year's sales will barely scratch the surface of its opportunity. Paying a premium for AMD stock today might actually seem like a total bargain looking back on this moment a few years from now.Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

{"date": "2023-12-24-21-23", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/t-stock-buy-reason-122500357.html", "text_blocks": "The last few years have been a miserable time to own AT&T (NYSE: T) stock. Thanks largely to its dividend income, AT&T investors earned a total return of just 13% over the last five years, a span when the S&P 500 drove total gains of nearly 110%. Additionally, the company faces considerable financial challenges because it has to spend heavily to remain competitive with Verizon Communications and T-Mobile.Nonetheless, AT&T has reached a point where it has become too compelling to ignore, and one factor likely makes it a buy regardless of the apparent trials that might otherwise derail the stock.The reason to buy AT&T stock is its compelling valuation. The stock currently sells at a P/E ratio of 7. This is a small fraction of the S&P 500's average P/E ratio of 26. Since numerous technology stocks experienced multiple significant expansions amid the AI-driven boom, such valuations are uncommonly low in today's tech industry.On the surface, AT&T's dividend may bolster the appeal of the low valuation. Its $1.11 per share annual payout now offers a dividend yield of 6.7%. This is around 4.5 times the S&P 500's average dividend return, which has now fallen below 1.5%.Still, investors should approach this dividend cautiously. AT&T slashed the payout in early 2022 after 35 straight years of payout hikes. And considering its $138 billion total debt, the dividend could fall victim to further cuts as the company looks for ways to reduce that obligation.However, even if such a dividend cut leads to selling in the short term, investors need to remember that AT&T is one of only three 5G providers in the U.S. Since the company spent around $17.5 billion in capital expenditures over the previous 12 months, AT&T's network should remain competitive from a quality standpoint.Indeed, AT&T is adding customers. In the third quarter of 2023, the company reported 468,000 postpaid phone net additions and a \"historically low\" churn rate, indicating it largely holds on to current customers. This has left AT&T with a 47% market share, the largest in its industry, and a gain of 2 percentage points over the last year.Moreover, consumer broadband revenue rose 10% yearly while AT&T fiber grew revenue by 27%. This shows the growth is not just confined to its wireless business.Additionally, the AI boom could supercharge AT&T's growth. Since many AI-related functions take place in the cloud, the technology will depend on 5G and fiber networks like the ones owned by AT&T to execute AI-driven workloads. Meeting that need will bode well for AT&T's top and bottom lines and should boost shareholder value over time.Due to improving business conditions, the low valuation makes AT&T a compelling buy. Thanks to a rising market share and the AI-driven need for AT&T's networks, the company and its stock should move higher in the long term.Admittedly, the massive debt is still a concern, and that could lead to another payout reduction or even the possible elimination of the dividend.However, the improving financial conditions could lead to stock gains compensation for the lost dividend income. As AT&T solidifies its market leadership in an essential industry, it becomes increasingly likely that its valuation and stock price will begin to rise.Should you invest $1,000 in AT&T right now?Before you buy stock in AT&T, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and AT&T wasn't one of them.

After the brutal sell-offs they endured in 2022, many of their stocks recovered as OpenAI's ChatGPT renewed interest in artificial intelligence (AI).Investors might differ on whether traders are in another bull market. Whatever the answer is to that question, many of these stocks will likely keep moving higher in 2024 as interest rates fall and confidence rises.To that end, here's why these three Motley Fool contributors think investors might want to consider Twilio (NYSE: TWLO), UiPath (NYSE: PATH), and CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ: CRWD).Justin Pope (Twilio): Cloud-based communications company Twilio has had an excellent year, up 55% in 2023. That's a step in the right direction, though shares are still down 80% from their former high.So, what's been the problem? Revenue growth slowed, and Wall Street got fed up with the business losing money.Management heard the message and began focusing on cutting costs to turn the ship around. You can see below that free cash flow has exploded in the right direction, and now the business is posting an adjusted profit. Wall Street rewarded Twilio's turnaround, but revenue growth must improve for the stock's ascension to continue.Fortunately, there are reasons for optimism. Scan the technology sector, and you'll see many companies that saw growth slow over the past two years.Surging interest rates designed to slow inflation (and corporate spending in the process) are primarily to blame. While revenue growth slowed, Twilio has continued growing its customer base. It had 306,000 active accounts as of the third quarter, up from 250,000 two years ago.And it recently launched CustomerAI, a service that uses AI and real-time data from Twilio's engagement platforms to personalize insights and marketing for individual customers. Twilio could see growth come back some when corporate spending loosens up again. Analysts see revenue growing to $5 billion by 2025, up from $4.1 billion over the last 12 months.Analysts believe Twilio's improving profitability will generate annual earnings growth averaging 45% over the next several years. Meanwhile, the stock trades at just 36 times earnings, a favorable price/earnings-to-growth ratio of 0.8. The bottom line is that Twilio's comeback story should stretch beyond 2023.Will Healy (UiPath): Cathie Wood called robotics one of the 14 transformative technologies that will change the world. Such innovations tend also to benefit investors, and in the robotics realm, the company most likely to drive such returns is UiPath.UiPath is a software company leading the way in robotic process automation (RPA). Its software bots perform repetitive tasks and serve as virtual assistants, and AI drives many of these processes.The company stands out from competitors through its UiPath Community, which provides free training, tools, and support to more than 2 million users. This fosters engagement and an exchange of ideas within its ecosystem, which has the effect of reinforcing the company's software as the standard.To this end, it attracted almost 2,000 customers that spent $100,000 or more on the platform as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Oct. 31). Moreover, management reported net dollar retention of 121%, meaning customers on the platform for more than one year increased spending by an average of 21% over the previous year.That helped increase revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 to $903 million, 20% higher than one year ago. The company also reduced its net loss over the period to $124 million, down from a $301 million loss during the same period in fiscal 2023.Nonetheless, stock-based compensation led to that loss. With $183 million in adjusted free cash flow over the previous three quarters and around $1 billion in cash, UiPath does not need outside funding.With that financial stability and its AI-driven niche, the stock has risen by about 95% in 2023. And since analysts predict rising revenue for the foreseeable future, that increase will most likely continue in 2024.Lastly, its valuation indicates it is not too late to buy the robotics stock. At a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 12, the multiple is low by historical standards, likely setting the stage for more AI-driven gains.Jake Lerch (CrowdStrike Holdings): It's been a year to remember for CrowdStrike Holdings. Up 144% in 2023, CrowdStrike's stock is the third-best performer within the Nasdaq 100, trailing only Nvidia and Meta Platforms.The company, which employs AI to thwart cyberattacks, is seeing demand for its products go through the roof. Part of the reason is that cyberattacks themselves are becoming so widespread.Indeed, in just the past few weeks, MongoDB, VF (the maker of Vans and North Face apparel), and mortgage broker Mr. Cooper Group (formerly known as Nationstar Mortgage Holdings) have all announced cyber breaches that resulted in the exposure of sensitive customer or employee data.What's more, these are only the attacks the public knows about. It's conceivable that many more ransomware attacks -- hacks where cybercriminals demand payment instead of exposing sensitive data or shutting crucial systems -- fly under the radar.CrowdStrike's security modules help organizations by securing their network, data, and endpoints to prevent catastrophic breaches before they happen. The company's AI is trained to examine billions of data points -- learning what behaviors are typical and which are potentially malicious. When a potential hostile action is identified, the AI takes preventative action or alerts security personnel accordingly.Thanks to its cutting-edge technology, CrowdStrike's revenue has soared this year, and the trailing-12-month figure now stands at $2.9 billion. Quarterly revenue is growing at 35% year over year, while free cash flow has a compound annual growth rate of 43% over the last three years.In short, CrowdStrike is riding a tsunami of growth in the cybersecurity industry that should see it continue its stunning growth well into 2024 and beyond.Should you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?Before you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and CrowdStrike wasn't one of them.

Consider the much-anticipated Starlink IPO. Elon Musk’s SpaceX is the most valuable private company in the U.S., and its largest revenue driver by far is Starlink, which offers broadband connections around the globe via a constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites.But Musk is in no hurry to spin off Starlink, despite excitement over the idea. A big reason why? The advantages of being a private company versus a public one.“At SpaceX, we never think about the quarter. We never think about it, and we don't think about the stock price,\" Musk said this week during a Spaces conversation hosted by ARK Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood.As he knows from leading Tesla, there’s “immense pressure on a public company to not have a bad quarter. So this can actually result in a less efficient operation, where you're going to great lengths at the end of a quarter to not disappoint people.”Asked if he can better take appropriate risks with SpaceX than Tesla because the former is private, Musk replied, “Absolutely.”SpaceX has quickly become the dominant launch provider, and Starlink is well ahead of its future rivals, notably Amazon’s Project Kuiper. The company has started talks to sell insider shares at a price that puts its valuation at close to $180 billion, Bloomberg reported on Dec. 12.Speculation on the timing of a Starlink spinoff IPO now ranges from late 2024 to 2027, though last month Musk denied that it would happen next year. In January, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya predicted that Starlink would go public this year and that its valuation would “be at least half of SpaceX’s current private worth,” which at the time was about $150 billion.Starlink revenue surged from $222 million in 2021 to $1.4 billion last year, the Wall Street Journal reported in September. But that's low considering that eight years ago SpaceX projected $12 billion in revenue in 2022. Last month, Musk announced that Starlink had achieved break-even cash flow.Starlink has more than 5,000 satellites in operation and the service has surpassed 2 million active users, according to SpaceX; meanwhile, the popular retailer Costco recently began selling its receivers.But, Musk said this week, “I don't think it's worth going public until you have maybe an extremely stable and predictable revenue stream. At that point, going public is less of an issue because you're just not going to have these big gyrations.”In the meantime, Musk has little problem luring venture capitalists to invest in SpaceX given his track record, and he welcomes them. “If others are prepared to invest at a particular value…it’s sort of an outside assessment of the value of the company,\" noted the world's richest man.Getting satellites into space, of course, is wildly expensive, and the payoff can take some time. Ashlee Vance, who wrote a 2017 book about Musk, told the billionaire earlier this year that he sometimes questions whether the Starlink business case makes sense given the “incredible amount of money” spent on something that “may or may not work.” He asked Musk if he also had doubts.“The business case is not subjective, it is objective,” Musk replied. “If you can provide a compelling internet connection, where the quality of the product and the price are competitive with terrestrial options—or often there are simply no terrestrial options—then you obviously have a business.”SpaceX being private also spares it from analysts’ influence, Musk added this week. One of the challenges of public markets, he said, is that “a lot of the analysts following companies have a time horizon that is maybe only a year or two...they do not care about what your long-term outcome will be because their career is dependent on how you do in the short term.”At Tesla, “we feel like we have a sort of moral obligation to not have a bad quarter and disappoint people,” he said, adding that he’s often spent New Year’s Eve at delivery centers until midnight.He complained that the \"legal burden of being public is also way too high. So if you're public, you're just going to be sued nonstop by these class-action law firms...the plaintiff is simply a puppet, but the media never mentions this...That drives me crazy. It's constantly happening.\"Musk acknowledged the advantages of Tesla going public, the most obvious being the greater capital availability. It also helped the carmaker clean up its capital structure, which was “overly complex as a private company,\" he added.But, he said, it’s “been a tremendous distraction as well on the downside.”At SpaceX, by contrast, Musk and company have largely floated above such earthly distractions.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com"}

{"date": "2023-12-24-21-23", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/nio-making-big-moves-stock-121800117.html", "text_blocks": "It's been a bit of a roller coaster for early investors of the electric vehicle (EV) industry. There have been lofty goals to catch Tesla and harsh realities of the cash crunch that come with manufacturing low volume and expensive EVs.That said, the temptation of buying into a successful EV maker early is enticing, and if you are considering an investment in the Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker Nio (NYSE: NIO), then last week brought two intriguing developments. Let's dig in.Let's start with a key development that sent Nio's stock upward. Nio wrangled in another cash injection from the Middle East when Abu Dhabi-backed fund CYVN Holdings agreed to invest $2.2 billion into the Chinese EV maker.When the deal is all said and done, CYVN will own a 20.1% stake in Nio, and the former will be able to nominate two directors to the latter's board. While the announcement may have surprised some investors, the two companies are far from strangers. In fact, CYVN invested $738.5 million in Nio in July and later bought up additional shares from an affiliate of Tencent Holdings for another $350 million.The cash infusion comes at a great time for Nio as the company had been falling short of sales targets and posting large losses. For context, through the first 11 months of 2023 the company's 142,026 in sales is a far cry from its original 250,000 EV goal.The investment in Nio signals confidence in the young EV automaker, and management also gave insights about its near-term strategy that could spark further enthusiasm in the company.Nio plans to launch its more affordable Firefly brand in Europe in 2025, Nio's president, Lihong Qin, said in a statement. Once considered a rising star and potential rival to Tesla, the Chinese EV maker had launched premium models in Norway in 2021 as well as Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Denmark in 2022.While pricing details have yet to be discussed, the Firefly brand will offer smaller models aimed at a family market audience. Firefly would represent a mass-market brand that would sell alongside its more premium models in a relationship similar to Toyota/Lexus.This is more than a ho-hum move from the Chinese automaker, because as demand slows in its home market it's able to capitalize on its cost advantages in Europe against western competitors. Moving into the European market offers Nio the ability to use its cost advantages to help offset the pricing wars ignited by Tesla's price cuts. It's roughly 20% to 25% cheaper to build cars in China than in Europe, if the foreign automakers don't initially manufacture locally -- though some of the cost advantage could be offset by tariffs.To be fair, while Nio appears to be making the right moves for investors, it's important to take a deep breath and realize that it's OK for investors to take a wait-and-see approach. See how the company executes entering Europe with two new brands, and see if the cost advantages make a positive impact on the company's previously expanding losses. Wait and see if the company can boost sales to hit targets it was missing by a wide margin.Nio needed a cash infusion and a strategy to spark enthusiasm in the once rising star EV maker. It got both of those things, but savvy investors would be wise to make sure management can execute in Europe before jumping on the bandwagon.Should you invest $1,000 in Nio right now?Before you buy stock in Nio, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nio wasn't one of them.

{"date": "2023-12-24-21-23", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/3-income-stocks-help-ring-111500031.html", "text_blocks": "With 2023 drawing to a close, it's time to start looking ahead to the new year. Many investors are already considering making changes to boost their portfolio's performance in 2024.Chevron (NYSE: CVX), Enbridge (NYSE: ENB), and MPLX (NYSE: MPLX) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors as great income stocks to add to your portfolio to ring in the new year. Here's why they think those stocks could put a charge in your portfolio's income-generating capabilities in 2024.Neha Chamaria (Chevron): Chevron is one of the best oil and gas stocks in terms of dividend stability and growth. The oil and gas producer increased its dividend for the 36th straight year in 2023, and you can safely expect another hike coming your way in January 2024. That's because Chevron is entering 2024 with a bang, so much so that it has already announced a potential 8% raise in its dividend per share next year.The thing is, Chevron is about to acquire Hess Corporation in early 2024 in an all-stock deal worth $60 billion. Chevron will not only gain access to assets in the Bakken and Gulf of Mexico after the acquisition, but also own a stake in the Stabroek block in Guyana. Chevron expects the combined company to grow production and free cash flow (FCF) \"faster and longer\" than Chevron's current five-year guidance -- the oil and gas giant currently expects to grow annual FCF by more than 10% through 2027.That should also mean bigger returns for Chevron shareholders in terms of both dividends and share repurchases. Chevron has already proven its mettle as a dividend stock and yields a solid 4.2% today. The best part is that its expected upcoming 8% dividend hike next year is already bigger than its average dividend growth over the past five years. In other words, 2024 should set the pace for higher dividend growth at Chevron, making it an even more alluring income stock to own as you step into the new year.Reuben Gregg Brewer (Enbridge): Canadian midstream giant Enbridge announced a modest 3% dividend increase in late November 2023. The dividend has been increased annually for 28 consecutive years, with the latest hike setting up year number 29. Enbridge is a very reliable dividend stock if income consistency is what you are after. The dividend yield is an attractive 7.6%.Don't be frightened by the elevated yield. The reason the dividend yield is so high is because growth is likely to be modest for the company going forward, meaning that the yield is likely to account for most of your return here. That should be just fine for you if you are looking to maximize the income your portfolio generates. Meanwhile, the dividend is backed by an investment grade rated company with a distributable cash flow payout ratio that's smack dab in the middle of its 60% to 70% target range. Simply put, there's no reason to think the dividend is at any risk.Enbridge is not exciting. It is a foundational income investment around which you can build a portfolio, perhaps including more dividend growth-oriented stocks. As you look to 2024 -- perhaps you are retiring -- Enbridge is the kind of stock that will let you ring in the new year with a healthy dose of income and without having to take on massive amounts of risk.Matt DiLallo (MPLX): MPLX provides investors with a supercharged income stream. The master limited partnership (MLP) currently pays a distribution that yields a whopping 9.3%. The midstream company has increased its already massive payout every year since its formation in 2012, including by 10% this year.That big-time payout is on rock-solid ground. The company generates very stable cash flow backed by long-term contracts with high-quality customers, including its parent, refining giant Marathon Petroleum. The MLP produced over $3.9 billion in cash through the first nine months of the year (up 7% from the year-ago period). That was enough to cover its distribution payments ($2.4 billion) and capital spending ($727 million) with $752 million to spare.That excess cash helped strengthen its already fortress-like balance sheet. MPLX ended the third quarter with $960 million in cash and a 3.4 times leverage ratio (comfortably below the 4.0 times ratio its stable cash flows can support). That gives it lots of financial flexibility.MPLX currently has several expansion projects under construction. It's expanding its natural gas and natural gas liquids long haul and crude oil gathering pipelines in the Permian and Bakken basins to support growing production in those regions. It's also expanding its natural gas processing capacity in the Permian and Marcellus basins, driven by producer demand. Its current slate of projects should come online through mid-2025, supplying it with incremental cash flow.The MLP's growing cash flows will give it more fuel to increase its distribution. Because of that, it should supply investors with a large and growing income stream in 2024 and beyond.Should you invest $1,000 in Chevron right now?Before you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Chevron wasn't one of them.

On top of that, many high-yielding dividend stocks also offer compelling upside potential due to a dirt cheap price or built-in growth prospects.LyondellBasell Industries (NYSE: LYB), Realty Income (NYSE: O), and Bank of N.T. Butterfield & Son (NYSE: NTB) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors for their compelling combination of income and upside. That's why they firmly believe investors won't regret buying shares at their current prices.Tyler Crowe (LyondellBasell Industries): Chemical and plastic manufacturing has, historically, been a good business for long-term-minded investors. It's a cyclical business, and its profitability can swing based on the price of feedstock, typically oil or natural gas. Still, global demand has grown steadily for decades as people around the world move up the socioeconomic ladder and, inevitably, use more plastic and other chemicals.LyondellBasell has been in the chemical and plastics business for decades. It is the largest manufacturer of polypropylene and polyethylene in Europe, the No. 2 producer of those products in the U.S., and the No. 5 producer of olefins globally.Two things stand out at LyondellBasell that make it a compelling high-yield investment. For one, its shareholder returns have been spectacular. It has grown its base dividend by 22% annually since 2011 and has paid multiple special dividends and bought back considerable amounts of its own stock.The other intriguing element to LyondellBasell is its big push into circular plastic production. It has developed several innovative processes for breaking produced plastics back into base chemicals that can then be used for the production of new products. Management estimates its circular plastics will sell for higher prices than base plastics and have lower feedstock costs. Combined, the two should increase margins and profits.Today, the stock yields about 5.2% with a modest balance sheet and some impressive prospects for growth in the next few years. That looks like a good combination for a reliable and growing dividend for several years to come.Matt DiLallo (Realty Income): Realty Income has been an extremely reliable dividend payer over the years. The real estate investment trust (REIT) has increased its payout 123 times since its public market listing in 1994, including five times this year. That steady growth should continue, making it a no-brainer for income-seeking investors.The REIT already has a great head start on its 2024 growth plan. In October, it sealed a deal to buy fellow REIT Spirit Realty for $9.3 billion. The company expects that acquisition to close early next year. It should boost its adjusted funds from operations (FFO) by over 2.5% per share in the coming year. That will put it more than halfway to its target of growing its FFO per share by 4% to 5% per year.Meanwhile, the combined company expects to produce over $800 million in excess free cash flow after paying its high-yielding dividend (recently around 5.4%). That cash and its elite balance sheet give it ample capital to invest in more income-producing properties. The REIT has been spreading its wings by expanding into new areas. For example, over the past several quarters, it has added data centers, gaming properties, consumer-centric medical facilities, and vertical farming investments to its portfolio. It has also continued its international expansion and added a credit investment platform.Shares of Realty Income have slumped more than 10% over the past year over concerns about rising interest rates. However, that headwind should fade in 2024, given the expectation that rates will begin to fall. The currently lower share price makes Realty Income look like even more of a no-brainer investment right now. It enables investors to lock in a higher-yielding dividend that should keep rising in the future. That income, along with its earnings growth, puts the REIT in a strong position to produce double-digit annualized total returns from here.Jason Hall (Bank of N.T. Butterfield & Son): 2023 hasn't been a great year for banks. The banking collapses of the spring shook the confidence of many investors, while the ongoing pressures of higher interest rates on balance sheets has affected the bottom lines of a few. But one bank that's built well to profit in the current environment, and a future of rates higher than most have seen in decades, is N.T. Butterfield. Based in Bermuda, Butterfield operates there as well as the Cayman Islands, and the Channel Islands off the coast of the U.K. and Europe. Often considered tax havens, these locations are certainly favored by many of the global elite, and Butterfield has had a presence in these markets for well over a century.Despite this long presence as a valued bank in its core markets, since its IPO in late 2016, it's been a bit of a middling investment. Shares are up only 31%, while its dividend-included returns are 88%; however, that lags the market by about more than 60 percentage points.That's partly due to a pretty exuberant IPO debut price, as well as the 2023 banking crisis, but it's also a result of its relatively slow growth profile.But that doesn't mean investors should avoid it. To the contrary, I think it's an absolute steal. Shares trade for less than 7 times trailing earnings, and the dividend yield is almost 5.5% at recent prices. Even its price-to-book value of just under 2 is cheap for this bank based on its incredible profitability. It has earned 26.5% return on equity over the past year, and a 1.72% return on assets. Compare that to JPMorgan Chase's 18.7% and 1.35%, respectively, and you should see why this is a \"back-up-the-armored-truck\" sort of bank worth buying.Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Realty Income wasn't one of them.

It is struggling due to declining demand for its COVID products. And it may take some years before its top line starts rising meaningfully again. The company's recent forecast didn't help matters, either. But with the stock losing close to half its value this year, are investors being overly punitive on what's still a top healthcare company?On Dec. 13, Pfizer unveiled its forecast for the coming year, and to say it wasn't an exciting one would be an understatement. For 2024, the company projects that its revenue will be within a range of $58.5 billion to $61.5 billion. And this even includes revenue it will generate from its recently closed acquisition of cancer company Seagen, which is no small operation -- Pfizer projects that Seagen will add $3.1 billion in revenue next year.This year, the company projects its revenue to fall within a range of $58 billion to $61 billion. That means that Pfizer's business would likely experience a decline in revenue next year, if not for its recent acquisition. The best-case scenario for the company is that its revenue stays flat or achieves a modest increase in 2024. A year ago, Pfizer reported a record-breaking $100 billion in sales due to surging revenue from its COVID vaccine and pill.While the forecast is underwhelming, it also shouldn't come as a big surprise to investors. COVID isn't striking fear into people the way it was even a year ago. Demand for vaccines has been diminishing, and Pfizer investors have already been seeing the effects of that on the company's financials.Year to date, Pfizer's global revenue of $21.8 billion has declined 48% from the same period in 2022. A big part of the reason is that Comirnaty, the company's COVID vaccine, has experienced a 78% decline in sales.Next year, Pfizer is projecting that revenue from Comirnaty and Paxlovid (its COVID treatment) will still bring in $8 billion. That's the part of the forecast that may be concerning as demand for COVID vaccines and treatments has proven to be difficult to predict. But an overall slowdown in the business shouldn't be surprising for Pfizer investors.Pfizer's stock fell by nearly 7% after the company released its forecast. It has bounced back since then, but that may have more to do with the rally in the markets of late. Year to date, it is still down more than 45%. The stock is trading at just 10 times based on its future profits (based on analyst estimates). That suggests investors aren't overly optimistic about the company's future.However, Pfizer has been planning for growth in the long term. The company plans to add $25 billion in new additional revenue by 2030, with acquisitions such as Seagen playing a key part of that strategy. That will help in offsetting a decline in revenue from drugs losing patent protection and facing increased competition in the years ahead. But it won't be enough to get the company back to generating $100 billion in sales. The important takeaway for investors is that Pfizer is making efforts to grow its business, which means that in the long haul, this could still be a good growth stock to own.Pfizer has the potential to be one of the most undervalued stocks heading into next year. With the shares trading at a low multiple of earnings, investors have a good margin of safety with the stock in the event that it does worse than analysts expect next year. The average healthcare stock trades at more than 20 times its estimated earnings.As long as you're willing to be patient, Pfizer could be a good healthcare stock to add to your portfolio and hang on to for the long term.Should you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?Before you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Pfizer wasn't one of them.

And unless some dramatic sell-off occurs, it was an impeccable year in the market. But there's no telling what the market will do in 2024 -- or any short time period for that matter.Dividend stocks help smooth out the uncertainty that comes with investing in the stock market by providing stable, usually quarterly streams of dividend income no matter what the market is doing. In a year of massive outperformance like 2023, a dividend looks a bit negligible. But during a market downturn, a dividend can be a way to generate income without selling a stock when its down, and can even provide buying power to buy other stocks when they are on sale.Here's why Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX), Kennametal (NYSE: KMT), and United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) are three dividend stocks worth buying in 2023.Scott Levine (Phillips 66): With the holiday season in full swing, many investors are tightening their purse strings to accommodate their gift lists. That may mean temporarily giving up some personal indulgences, but it may also mean they're looking for bargains in the stock market. Fortunately for them, Phillips 66 -- with its forward-yielding 3.2% dividend -- is hanging on the discount rack.Operating both midstream and downstream assets, Phillips 66 is an excellent energy choice for income investors looking to supplement their passive income. Earlier this month Phillips 66 announced a $2.2 billion capital budget for 2024, which includes $1.3 billion for growth projects. In particular, Phillips 66 plans on allocating $654 million for growing its refining business, including the transition of the San Francisco Refinery into what the company characterizes as \"one of the world's largest renewable fuels facilities.\" This is part of management's overall initiative to improve its refining capability by investing in high-return projects that will help the company increase market capture by 5%.Phillips 66 has demonstrated consistent interest in rewarding shareholders since it started paying a dividend in 2012. From then until now, in fact, Phillips 66 has raised its dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 16%. Further evidence of the company's commitment comes in the form of a recent announcement that the company has upwardly revised its target for shareholder distributions. Whereas the company had initially planned on returning $10 billion to $12 billion to shareholders from July 2022 through December 2024, it now expects to return $13 billion to $15 billion to investors over that time frame.With shares of Phillips 66 currently changing hands at 6.9 times forward earnings, today sees like a great time to pick up shares of this high-quality, high-yield stock.Lee Samaha (Kennametal): The tooling and metal-cutting products company isn't the most exciting investment, but it currently yields 3% and has solid end markets and earnings growth prospects.Management recently held an investor day presentation and laid out plans to generate organic sales growth of 4%-6% through 2027, accompanied by adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin expansion from 15.5% in 2023 to 20% to 23% in 2027. That combination is expected to produce a compound annual growth rate of 20% to 25% in adjusted earnings per share.Given that management's stated capital allocation aims include returning \"cash to shareholders via dividends and stock repurchases,\" it's hard to imagine its dividend payout won't increase significantly if the 2027 targets are hit.Kennametal doesn't operate in high-growth markets (the 4% to 6% growth plan assumes just 1% to 2% annual market growth, with 1% to 2% coming from market share gains and 2% from pricing). This is more a story of the company refocusing on some of its higher-growth end markets, such as metal cutting tools in aerospace & defense and medical, as well as a solid contribution from its exposure to infrastructure spending.At the same time, management plans to drive margin expansion by cutting costs by $100 million by closing plants to reduce structural costs and investing in automation and smart manufacturing facilities. All told, it all comes together to make Kennametal a boring way to generate growth and dividends over the next few years, and that's fine for many investorsDaniel Foelber (UPS): UPS suffered a slight sell-off in response to worse-than-expected results and lower revenue guidance from FedEx (NYSE: FDX) on Dec. 19. And while UPS and FedEx have their similarities, and sometimes deserve to trade in tandem, that certainly hasn't been the case this year.In fact, 2023 may be one of the biggest years of outperformance for FedEx over UPS -- ever.Going into its Q2 fiscal 2024 earnings, FedEx was up 61.8% year-to-date, while UPS was down 7%. FedEx has done a better job protecting its margins than UPS. And FedEx stock had some catching up to do, as its valuation is still reasonable even after this year's run up.But UPS stands out as the better buy for 2024. For one, the dividend yield is far higher -- 4.1% for UPS compared to 2% for FedEx. UPS has also done a phenomenal job growing the \"sticky\" parts of its business, such as healthcare and small and medium-sized businesses.In addition to a downturn in the cycle, one of the reasons why UPS has been under pressure is that it failed to properly forecast near-term results, which caused repeated downward adjustments to its guidance. The stock market doesn't like poor results, but it dislikes uncertainty even more. Especially coming from a market darling like UPS that gave investors everything they could have asked for and then some in 2020 and 2021.UPS has the makings of a quality turnaround play going into 2024. Sentiment is negative on the stock. And after FedEx's miss, it could be negative on the package delivery industry in general. That's a nice opportunity for investors who trust UPS to deliver over the long run. The attractive dividend yield is a worthy incentive to simply hold UPS and wait for the business to remind investors what it can do during an uptick in the cycle.Should you invest $1,000 in Phillips 66 right now?Before you buy stock in Phillips 66, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Phillips 66 wasn't one of them.

Greater China sales rose 4% to $1.86 billion, below the expected $1.95 billion as growth slowed from the prior quarter.Nike also cut its full-year sales forecast to a 1% gain from its prior view for mid-single-digits growth. And management announced plans to reduce costs by as much as $2 billion over the next three years.\"This new outlook reflects increased macro headwinds, particularly in Greater China and EMEA, adjusted digital growth plans based on recent digital traffic softness and higher marketplace promotions, lifecycle management of key product franchises and a stronger US dollar that has negatively impacted second half reported revenue versus 90 days ago,\" CFO Matthew Friend said on the earnings call.Nike stock declined more than 10% Friday, and rivals Adidas and Under Armour fell 5% and 3%, respectively. Shares of Foot Locker, which relies on Nike products in their stores, also moved 4% lower.Other companies with heavy exposure to China have also reported weakness recently. Last month, Apple said quarterly revenue in China, its third largest market, fell 2.2% to $15.1 billion, well below the $17 billion Wall Street expected.In addition to flagging consumer demand, Apple has also had to battle Beijing's decision to ban the use of iPhones by government employees as well as the ongoing shift for domestic customers to opt for local Chinese tech brands over foreign names.Still, the warnings from Nike and Apple suggest that China's economy is continuing to languish after Beijing removed strict zero-COVID policies late last year.Despite the central government's stimulus efforts, key headwinds remain, particularly across the indebted property sector, which has raised concerns of a potential \"Lehman\" moment and slammed consumer confidence.That in turn has led to less spending, more precautionary savings, and even signs of deflation. Meanwhile, foreign investors have been pulling out of the country in droves.Bank of America strategists warned in September that China's stalling economy presented risks to a swath of US companies including Applied Materials, Broadcom, Wynn Resorts, and Qualcomm.But China's pain could be America's gain, especially if weak prices there translate to less inflationary pressure here, according to market veteran Ed Yardeni.\"China's weak economy is good news for the US in particular, helping to moderate goods inflation without a recession here, aka 'immaculate disinflation,\" he said last month.Read the original article on Business Insider"}

This means fund managers investing in emerging market trackers have exposure to China by default, rather than making an active decision to back the nation.In contrast to previous years’ surveys, not a single fund said it is investing in China with the expectation of higher relative returns, because of the increasing importance of the country in the global economy, or because it has a positive outlook for Chinese growth.At the start of 2023, economists had hoped for a strong rebound from China as authorities in Beijing belatedly ditched their strict Covid lockdown measures.But instead the property crisis has deepened and growth has disappointed, deterring investors.Craig Thorburn, a director of Future Fund, which manages Australia’s wealth, said it is cutting back on investment in China.In a submission to OMFIF he said: “We reduced our exposure to China, reflecting increased intervention in market sectors and the accumulation of challenges to their economic growth model.”Nikhil Sanghani at OMFIF, said large, long-term funds will not typically liquidate their investments overnight, but are now likely to make fewer new investments in China.He added: “What is interesting is the shift in tone. It is all about intentions. They are becoming more hesitant or cautious on China. It tallies up with the general mood in financial markets more broadly towards China.“They are long-term players, they are looking very strategically at their long-term investments, so I doubt this means they will pull their money out of China immediately. It is more likely that if they are going to allocate towards emerging markets, it looks like that is going to be towards India rather than China right now.”India is soon going to benefit from more passive investment inflows as its government debt will be added to JP Morgan’s emerging markets government bond index from June, automatically reallocating more international cash to the country.Mr Sanghani said that India’s economy has remained solid even as China’s has slowed, making the country relatively more attractive to international money.“Because of these structural headwinds you are seeing in China and its economy, because of some of the geopolitical tensions, in a relative sense India is starting to look a bit more appealing,” he said.“It is not like things in India have been standing still. I think there are areas where things seem to be opening up to foreign investors.”This includes improving liquidity in bond markets to gain a place in the JP Morgan index.He expects pension money to become particularly important to future economic growth as governments around the world have major schemes in mind but have little fiscal headroom to finance their plans.Mr Sanghani said: “I think [these funds] have a massive role to play. We see across the world right now that, frankly, there isn’t the fiscal space to do a lot.“Particularly on these big issues around the energy transition for example, there is limited fiscal space.”He pointed to the German government’s green spending plans which have been shot down by the constitutional court, while in the UK the Government is trying to enlist pension funds to invest more in Britain.Mr Sanghani added: “There is an increasing onus for probably the public sector to try and make sure they are better mobilising either their existing pools of capital with their domestic pension funds or sovereign funds, but also trying to become more open to that foreign investment.”Losing access to some of these international funds will be damaging to China’s economy at a time when it is already struggling to regain its pre-Covid momentum.India’s economy is on track to out-grow China’s for the third consecutive year and, according to predictions from the International Monetary Fund, will keep doing so in every one of the five years of its forecast.India’s stock market capitalisation is also gaining on China’s, according to Tim Hayes at Ned Davis Research, as the country gains on its bigger rival and draws in more international cash.He said: “India’s demographic outlook and long-term growth potential are both far better than China’s.”RecommendedWar is coming.

For workers who pay into the Social Security system throughout their careers, it's easy to see those benefits as a return of the payroll taxes that got taken out of their checks over the years.However, Social Security also provides coverage for workers' family members. In particular, spousal benefits give eligible spouses of covered workers a substantial benefit. And best of all, spouses can be eligible without having any work history at all. As a result, spousal benefits can put as much as $1,889 per month into your pocket without you ever having had to work for a paycheck -- or pay any wage taxes into the system.For workers, getting retirement benefits takes years of effort. Eligibility for most Social Security retirement benefits hinges on having accumulated at least 40 Social Security credits in the course of your career. A person can earn a maximum of four credits per year, and in 2023, it took earnings of $1,640 to earn one credit (and thus $6,560 to earn four). Therefore, to be entitled to receive Social Security payments after retirement based on your own employment history, you must generally work for a minimum of 10 years.Or instead, one may be able to claim benefits based on their spouse's work history. To do that, generally, the only requirement is that you must have been married to them for at least one year before you claim benefits. However, if you have a child with your spouse, the one-year rule doesn't apply and you can get spousal benefits immediately.In some cases, divorced persons can also be eligible to receive benefits based on an ex-spouse's work record. However, different rules apply: The would-be recipient may not have remarried, and their marriage to the ex-spouse in question must have lasted at least 10 years.The amount of spousal benefits you're entitled to receive depends on the primary insurance amount (PIA) of the worker upon whose work history you're claiming Social Security. The more earnings the working spouse had over their career, the larger their PIA will be.Typically, a spousal benefit will be equal to one-half of the PIA. The PIA represents the benefit that the worker would be eligible to receive by claiming at their full retirement age.Note that even if the worker claims retirement benefits early, it doesn't necessarily affect the amount the spouse will get in spousal benefits. If the spouse waits until full retirement age before claiming, then their spousal benefit will not get reduced for an early claim. However, if the spouse claims before they reach full retirement age, then reductions will apply. The amounts of the reductions differ slightly from the reductions imposed on a worker's benefit for claiming early. For each month early, up to 36 months, spousal benefits get reduced by 25/36 of a percentage point. Beyond 36 months, each month incurs an additional reduction of 5/12 of a percentage point.To get a sense of the maximum benefit on the table here, take a look at the most recent figures from the Social Security Administration. For someone turning 66 in 2024, the maximum retirement benefit is $3,652 per month. However, this person would likely have a full retirement age of 66 1/2, so the $3,652 amount reflects a reduction of 3 1/3%. The corresponding PIA to generate this monthly payment would be about $3,778. Half of that is $1,889, so that's the biggest monthly spousal benefit you can expect to get.You should be aware that if you have a work history of your own, you won't be able to just add the spousal benefit amount to your own retirement benefit. The Social Security Administration will pay you whichever of the two amounts is greater.In addition, spousal benefits for a spouse generally aren't available unless the worker has claimed retirement benefits. So even if you'd otherwise be eligible, you might have to wait until your working spouse starts getting Social Security before you can claim  spousal benefits.Social Security was designed to financially assist not just retired workers but their spouses and other eligible family members. Even if you didn't work and never paid wage taxes into the program, you've earned your Social Security. Be sure to understand your benefit so you can get as much as you're entitled to receive.The $21,756 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlookIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $21,756 more... each year!

Of course, finding a game-changing company set to revolutionize an industry is far easier said than done. Remember back when Tesla changed the game by essentially introducing a sports car that was battery electric powered? And Tesla did so at a time ditching fossil fuels seemed daunting -- and that's putting it lightly. Those high-flying and wild days might be behind Tesla, although its story has plenty of room to run yet, but one company might be about to enter game-changing territory.\"If QuantumScape can get this technology into mass production, it holds the potential to transform the industry,\" said Stan Whittingham, co-inventor of the lithium-ion battery and winner of the 2019 Nobel Prize in chemistry, in a QuantumScape press release.QuantumScape's (NYSE: QS) battery technology could be groundbreaking. At a time when electric vehicles (EVs) are positioning themselves for mass adoption, the company could be a lucrative long-term investment. Move over Tesla; QuantumScape could be the next stock to make investors rich.Starting with some basic background on a company you may not have heard of, QuantumScape has over 12 years of research and development investment in its battery technologies. It employs a world-class battery development team comprising over 800 employees and owns over 300 patents and patent applications.QuantumScape has also caught the eye of major global automakers during its journey. It has contracts with six automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), including Volkswagen, a key partner and investor, and two other top 10 OEMs, two established global luxury OEMs, and a pure-play EV company.To simplify a somewhat complicated story, QuantumScape's battery technology improves the process by simplifying the cell design. It eliminates the need for graphite, silicon, or lithium foil, enabling the battery to increase energy density and improve range while boasting 15-minute fast charging.More specifically, QuantumScape's batteries could recharge from zero to 80% of capacity in about half the time most lithium-ion EV batteries require. An EV using QuantumScape's batteries could extend its range by roughly 80% with similar weight. Essentially, the potential groundbreaking battery technology could improve on nearly every aspect of the status quo.At the end of 2022, QuantumScape shipped its first A0 prototype cells to potential customers for a proof-of-concept. Its top-performing AO prototype cell in one potential customer's battery testing labs achieved over 1,000 full-cycle equivalents with over 95% discharge energy retention. While management reiterated this was a cherry-picked high-end result and that there's much work to do regarding reliability, it's an extraordinary result and well above its commercial target of 800 cycles and 80% energy retention.Huge, obvious risks come with investing in a preproduction company. The blunt truth is that no company has done what QuantumScape is trying to achieve, and the company, despite its recent encouraging test results, could ultimately fail to produce its technology entirely or as reliably as required to transform the industry.However, QuantumScape has spent much of 2023 attempting to move from prototype to product, and the company has a cash runway that extends into 2026, with the ability to potentially raise more funds if necessary.If QuantumScape does accomplish its targets and reaches production with a next-generation EV battery, its opportunity is massive. Consider that battery electric vehicles (BEV) only recently hit about 10% of the global light-vehicle market, and management believes the opportunity could potentially be hundreds of billions of dollars annually for decades.For all of its massive upside, there are the aforementioned risks investors take when investing in a preproduction company. QuantumScape is still a few years away from mass-producing its batteries, and the process of going from a successful prototype to a mass-production battery has been slow -- a speed Wall Street isn't fond of.QuantumScape isn't an investment for everyone; it's not for the risk-averse or faint of heart. But a small position in QuantumScape has incredible upside after shedding nearly 70% of its value since its initial public offering. If the company gets to mass production and carves out its slice of a massive target-market pie, it could easily drive not only global electric vehicles but also your entire portfolio.10 stocks we like better than QuantumScapeWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Its stock is down 34% since then, as fears over commodity inflation, pricing power, volume decline, and fierce competition continue to grow.Overall, the Consumer Staples Select Sector (XLP) index is down roughly 5% over the past year, compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 25% gain.Following a meeting with Hershey executives, JP Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said the tone of the company was not confidence-inspiring.\"We emerged incrementally more cautious about Q4 2023 and next year ... and we are starting to think that consensus’ estimate for a flattish gross margin next year is highly optimistic,\" Goldman wrote in a note to clients.Hershey reiterated its 2023 full-year outlook last quarter. It expects net sales growth of roughly 8%, earnings per share growth of 13%-15%, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 11%-12%.Higher prices for two much-needed ingredients — sugar and cocoa — aren't helping its outlook.Sugar prices have been on a roller coaster, even though they're coming down. Sugar futures (SB=F) are up nearly 4% compared to a year ago, after jumping 40% year over year in early November.\"There has been volatility, especially with the weather patterns,\"Andraia Torsiello, Mintec US sugar analyst, told Yahoo Finance over the phone, adding that \"supply availability has improved year over year.\"Supply outlook is looking brighter in Brazil. India, another major producer, is recovering as well after the government \"instructed mills to focus on sugar production rather than ethanol,\" as unfavorable weather conditions resulted in poor crops this year.And in the US, sugar beet harvest hit a record high in 2023.Cocoa prices could offset that savings as a warmer weather pattern, known as El Niño, drifts over Asia. Cocoa futures (CC=F) are up roughly 65% compared to last year.Goldman wrote Hershey said in its meeting that \"the amount of cocoa inflation has been extraordinary.\"Irregular weather patterns have limited cocoa exports from India, as it focuses on domestic consumption, and Thailand's supply will be short as well, David Branch of Wells Fargo told Yahoo Finance over the phone.Branch expects the El Niño pattern to last through Q1 of 2024 and maybe the second half of 2024.While Hershey CEO Michele Buck said in a call with investors that the company has \"pricing and productivity\" that can help offset the rising costs, the company's comments to Goldman gave the analyst pause.Statements like \"we've gone to the pricing lever quite a bit over the last few years,\" and \"pricing remains a key part [of our longer-term strategy] but we also are sensitive to the consumer\" did not alleviate concerns Hershey doesn't have the pricing power to make up for higher input costs.Chocolates being a recession-proof category is \"no longer the case,\" Goldman wrote in his note to clients.In October, Hershey posted a 1% decrease in volume, while prices jumped 11.1% in North America confectionary.As consumers have been battling headwinds all year with high interest rates, the return of student loan payments, and sticky inflation, they're starting to pull back on small delights.\"Confections has definitely seen a little bit of softness recently,\" Dan Sadler, IRI principal of client insights, told Yahoo Finance. While consumers are not necessarily forgoing all sweets, they are opting for smaller sizes and more affordable brands.Other consumer staple companies to keep an eye on: JM Smucker (SJM), General Mills (GIS), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Kellanova (K), and WK Kellogg (KLG), among others.General Mills CEO Jeff Harmening said consumers are seeking value, bringing into question whether these companies can raise prices like they once did — especially as the popularity of private labels grows.\"While many factors have evolved in line with our expectations, we are seeing consumers continue to display stronger-than-anticipated value-seeking behaviors across our key markets,\" Harmening said on a call with investors.Innovation, though, will be a key differentiator in bringing in new customers. Sadler said companies are finally able to move past woes of the pandemic like supply chain issues and shortages and focus on creating new offerings.Oreo maker Mondelez (MDLZ) has done innovation right, per Morningstar director Erin Lash. The company opened a $50 million R&D center this year to help further develop its lines of Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers, and Sour Patch Kids candies. It's also offering more options in chocolates, such as Toblerone Truffles and Tiny Toblerone.\"I would attribute the ability or the track record [of the stock performance] to consumer-valued innovation,\" said Lash.Having geographical diversification is a plus as well, Consumer Edge research analyst Connor Rattigan told Yahoo Finance over the phone.\"[Mondelez is] exposed to all sorts of emerging markets, Asia, Latin America ... that can drive volume growth,\" Rattigan said.Rattigan also likes JM Smucker's $5.6 billion acquisition of Hostess, as it can drive product creation and new sales. The iconic cake snacks' dominance in convenience stores could help get Smucker's Uncrustables in more locations, and cross-collaboration could result in new offerings — say, jelly-filled Twinkies.Brooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

{"date": "2023-12-24-21-23", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/analysts-forecast-more-30-upside-130000040.html", "text_blocks": "Investors hoping for outsize gains over the next year may look toward Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Nvidia dominates the semiconductor market when it comes to chips designed for artificial intelligence (AI) purposes, and even with the stock's massive move higher, analysts project further upside over the next 12 months.However, stocks often fail to meet analyst expectations, and a 200% increase over the last year should rightly leave investors questioning how much more near-term upside they might have with Nvidia stock. Hence, investors should take a closer look before deciding whether to buy.Nvidia stock trades at just under $500 per share. It has been among the best performers of 2023 amid heightened interest in AI and the company's ability to support that technology.According to Tipranks, 34 different analysts have published 12-month projections for Nvidia stock. The estimates range from a low of $560 per share to as much as $1,100 per share. Under the worst-case scenario, Nvidia stock will rise 13%. The best-case scenario would take the stock almost 225% higher, surpassing the impressive performance of the last 12 months.Nonetheless, the average price target of just over $661 per share implies a 33% upside over the next 12 months. As mentioned before, analysts can be wrong. Still, over the past month, 15 of the 34 analysts highlighted in Tipranks have reiterated estimates, a reflection of how closely they watch the AI stock.Admittedly, the recent financials appear to more than back up the hype. In the third quarter of its fiscal 2024 (ended Oct. 29), Nvidia achieved record quarterly revenue of more than $18 billion. This was up 206% year over year and 34% from the previous quarter.Also, since the rise in operating expenses was comparatively modest, net income totaled $9.2 billion. In the year-ago quarter, Nvidia earned only $680 million. That's an almost 1,260% increase!Moreover, if Nvidia meets its expected $20 billion in Q4 revenue, it will experience a yearly increase of 231%, exceeding the current growth rate. Furthermore, the effects on valuation may not be as significant as some might assume, depending on how investors measure it. Currently, it supports a P/E ratio of about 65, a level not far above three-year lows.Still, the picture looks different when measured by price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. The stock currently sells at about 28 times sales. While the P/S ratio was higher recently, that takes it far above the level of Advanced Micro Devices or Intel, which could price Nvidia for perfection.Given Nvidia's recent performance and massive revenue and earnings growth, it could meet its price target. Many investors will likely buy, considering that even the worst-case scenario calls for the stock to closely approximate the S&P 500's average growth.However, the P/S ratio indicates the market has priced Nvidia stock quite richly. Indeed, the revenue and earnings growth rate may look like perfection to some shareholders.Nonetheless, given the highly positive view on the stock, perceptions will probably change for the worse if they change at all. As for how to invest in Nvidia stock, new investors may want to proceed cautiously, wait for a lower valuation, or consider a lower-cost stock in the same industry.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

{"date": "2023-12-24-21-24", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/heres-company-pushing-toward-next-111700726.html", "text_blocks": "The big story of 2023 has been the surging demand for artificial intelligence (AI). Just about every business is looking at ways to implement AI in their operations, while several big tech companies are pushing the boundaries of what AI can do.But a challenge lies ahead for many companies pushing the forefront of AI development. It's increasingly expensive to build and train large language models. Not only do these AI models require a large number of very expensive chips, but the amount of energy these processes consume is staggering. One study found, for example, a simple ChatGPT prompt required 10 times the electricity as a standard Google Search. When multiplied by billions of uses, that has a huge impact on costs: both monetary and environmental.And power demands are only getting bigger. \"Reducing power consumption is becoming more important as AI power demand could easily triple in two years,\" Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) CEO C. C. Wei said at a recent conference. As such, in order for AI developers to keep pushing us forward, they need more efficient chips. And TSMC is likely the company that will bring that next big advancement to the market.Here's what investors need to know.While chip designers like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) get a lot of attention for their chips, it's important to understand what allows them to make such powerful chip designs in the first place.The amount of processing power any individual chip has is largely determined by the number of transistors on a chip. More transistors means you can run more processes at once, giving you more computing power.But there are limits to how big you can make a processor unit for use in a server (or laptop or smartphone). So, the only way to build chips with more transistors on them is to fit more transistors into the same amount of space. That's easier said than done.The most advanced technology available uses a process called 3-nanometer. It's what Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) used to fit 92 billion transistors onto its M3 Max MacBook Pro processor, which is approximately 400 square millimeters.The next generation is a 2-nanometer process, which will increase performance 10% to 15% over 3nm and decrease power consumption 25% to 30%. TSMC is competing with Samsung and Intel to bring that process to market, ensuring they can print those chips economically with high reliability.TSMC is planning to install tooling for its 2nm process in one facility in April. Volume manufacturing won't start until the second half of 2025, though. (Apple is likely the first customer for that process.) Intel expects to start producing its 2nm chips by the end of 2024. But getting a process in place is one thing, getting yields and pricing to a point where it makes sense for customers to switch their designs from their existing manufacturer is another.Despite the competition, TSMC holds a couple of significant advantages when it comes to developing the next generation of chips.First of all, it cannot be discounted that the only thing TSMC does is manufacture chips for other companies. Intel designs its own chips that may compete with other chip designers. Likewise, Samsung makes chips and electronic devices, so while it has a great built-in customer, it curbs its appeal for many other chipmakers.Moreover, TSMC has a scale advantage. It accounted for 57.9% of chip-manufacturer revenue in the third quarter. Samsung, its next closest competitor, managed to attract just 12.4% of revenue.That scale is important because creating the processes and tooling for the next generation of chips is becoming increasingly expensive. TSMC spent $1.6 billion in research and development last quarter. Few other chip manufacturers are even bringing in that much revenue each quarter.TSMC can justify spending so heavily because it has existing relationships with huge companies like Apple and Nvidia. That creates a virtuous cycle whereby the tech giants buy from TSMC, TSMC reinvests some of that money into developing the next-generation process, and then it attracts even more customers as competitors struggle to catch up.Despite its position as a leading supplier of the most advanced AI chips in the market, TSMC's stock doesn't trade at the sky-high valuation of many of the well-known AI stocks.Even after the stock's strong price performance since the start of November, shares still trade at less than 17x analysts' consensus estimate for 2024 earnings. Not only is that lower than the forward earnings multiple of the S&P 500 as a whole, it's well below TSMC's historical P/E ratio of around 21.5. So, if the stock merely sees multiple expansion toward its historical norm, it should trade substantially higher by the end of next year.Considering the importance of TSMC for the future of AI development, it could see even better performance as demand for powerful and energy-efficient chips grows.Should you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn't one of them.
