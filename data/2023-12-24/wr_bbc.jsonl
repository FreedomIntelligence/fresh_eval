There were no casualties.\nIran has not commented. There has recently been a series of drone and rocket attacks on ships in the Red Sea by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.\nIn a separate development, the US Central Command (CENTCOM) said that on Saturday \"two Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles were fired into international shipping lanes in the Southern Red Sea from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. No ships reported being impacted by the ballistic missiles\".\nIt also said the USS Laboon warship patrolling the area \"shot down four unmanned aerial drones originating from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen that were inbound\" to the American vessel.\nLater that day, a crude oil tanker reported being hit by a Houthi drone in the southern Red Sea, while another tanker saw a near miss.\nThe rebels, who control, much of Yemen, claim to be targeting Israel-linked vessels over the continuing war in Gaza.\nMany large global shipping groups have suspended operations in the Red Sea due to the increased risk of attacks.\nIn a statement, the Pentagon said that Chem Pluto was hit by \"a one-way attack drone fired from Iran\".\nIt said it was \"a Liberia-flagged, Japanese-owned, and Netherlands-operated chemical tanker\".\nEarlier, maritime security firm Ambrey said the vessel was linked to Israel, and was heading from Saudi Arabia to India.\nThe incident took place 200 nautical miles south-west of the city of Veraval in India's Gujarat state, according to United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO).\nThe hit caused structural damage to the tanker and water was taken onboard.\nAmbrey said the event, which is the first of its kind so far away from the Red Sea, fell within an area the firm considered a \"heightened threat area\" for Iranian drones.\nThe Indian navy sent an aircraft and warships to offer assistance.\nEarlier on Saturday, the US accused Iran of being \"deeply involved\" in planning operations against commercial vessels in the Red Sea.\nNational security spokesperson Adrienne Watson said it was \"consistent with Iran's long-term material support and encouragement of the Houthis' destabilising actions in the region\".\nLater, an Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander warned it would force the closure of waterways other than the Red Sea if \"America and its allies continue committing crimes\" in Gaza.\nBrig Gen Mohammad Reza Naqdi said these could include the Mediterranean Sea and Strait of Gibraltar - but offered no details of how this would happen."}

This is a crucial test of the Biden administration, and whether it succeeds could help determine the next phase of the war - as well as the president's own political fortunes back home.\nIn public, the American effort to shape and restrain Israel's war has taken the form of advice rather than pressure.\nUS officials - from Mr Biden to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin - have continually affirmed what they present as Israel's right to self-defence, and declared that a military operation which stops short of removing Hamas from power would only guarantee more attacks.\nAs the conflict wore on, they've also become more outspoken about the need to protect civilians, warning that not doing so would land Israel with a \"strategic defeat\".\nMuch of the world sees this approach as failing to temper a relentless bombing campaign that ranks among the most deadly and destructive this century.\nUS officials insist their strategy has been the most effective way for the administration to influence an Israel traumatised by the unprecedented Hamas attack and disinclined to hold back.\nYet American policy since that day has fractured Joe Biden's Democratic Party, lost him crucial support among young and Arab Americans and left the US looking isolated on the world stage.\nSo far, President Biden's approach has achieved tangible, if limited, results.\nPersistent and painstaking diplomacy cleared a path to allowing some humanitarian aid into Gaza early on in the war, and helped broker a seven-day ceasefire to encourage hostage releases and the delivery of more assistance to desperate civilians.\nThe Americans have certainly been very hands on. A steady stream of senior officials to the region has meant there's been someone in the room much of the time, having the difficult conversations face to face.\n\"These trips are important because we have constant issues that we're dealing with together with the Israelis,\" said a US official.\nEach of Mr Blinken's three visits to the region has been a whirlwind of activity and he's been keen to highlight continued American efforts to free the hostages, increase humanitarian aid and ensure the conflict does not expand to consume the entire Middle East.\nProgress on protecting civilians has been hard to see. This week the death toll in Gaza reached 20,000, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. The Hamas raid on southern Israel on 7 October killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw about 240 taken hostage.\nDespite winning assurances that Israel would take steps to do so, Mr Blinken has spoken about the \"gap\" between the intent and the results.\nSo January will be a crucial test of whether the administration can convince Israel to alter the dynamic of the war. It's pushing the Israelis to \"de-intensify\" military operations in Gaza and transition to more targeted tactics that produce fewer civilian casualties than the bombing-and artillery-driven campaign.\nIt is a request that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not publicly endorsed, although his defence minister has talked about the war moving into different phases.\nCritics of the American strategy say the US has been so cautious that it is effectively complicit in Israel's war. They say it should have more forcefully called for Israel to curtail a disproportionate military campaign and used the threat to withhold or set conditions on massive amounts of American military aid to rein in Israeli excess.\nBut Aaron David Miller, who worked as a Middle East adviser in the State Department for some 25 years, calls the notion that the US could pressure Israel to change its policy in this case \"magical thinking.\"\n\"The battlefield dynamic is beyond our capacity to control, let alone micromanage,\" he says, noting that Israel and Hamas are pursuing irreconcilable goals.\nMr Miller, who is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Institute for International Peace, says history shows that Israel has responded to rare occasions of US pressure only when American demands are tethered to a result they can accept.\n\"Pressing the Israelis on a matter of critical importance to them without offering a compelling alternative or an outcome that they can rationalise and justify, never works,\" he says.\nIt's unclear if the \"bear hug\" strategy of publicly supporting Israel while preaching restraint behind closed doors will be enough to pull the Israelis across the line when it comes to scaling back the military campaign.\nIn the meantime the Americans are contending with growing international isolation.\nNowhere is this more evident than at the United Nations, where the US has opposed overwhelming demands for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.\nThis week, with the UN warning of famine in Gaza, the US allowed the passage of a second Security Council resolution calling for more humanitarian access to Gaza. It did so after negotiating intensely to change language on the suspension of hostilities and mechanisms to monitor and speed up aid delivery.\nThe administration wants no suggestion of a ceasefire that would constrain Israel's ability to destroy Hamas's leadership and military capability.\nBut even some allies have been outspoken about this approach.\n\"The United States is losing respect, it's losing credibility as a powerful nation,\" former Irish President Mary Robinson, speaking on behalf of a group of global leaders known as The Elders, said in a recent interview on RTE News. \"The United States has called for restraint, but [the Israeli government] isn't listening.\"\nAnd Arab partners of the US are alarmed by the radicalising effect of Israel's destruction in Gaza.\n\"Israel is jeopardising the standing of the United States and other Western friends of ours in our region,\" said Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi on a recent trip to Washington.\n\"It is not just killing Palestinians... it is also creating an environment in the region where the amount of hatred that's growing by the day, as a result of what we see unfolding in Gaza, is undoing 30 years of work that we all have invested in to normalise the idea of peace.\"\nMr Blinken has stressed that the regional and international community should also be pressing Hamas to lay down its arms and stop \"hiding behind civilians\".\nBut in comments at a fundraising event last week, President Biden appeared to acknowledge some of the administration's internal frustrations.\n\"(Israel) has most of the world supporting it,\" the president said. \"But they're starting to lose that support by the indiscriminate bombing that takes place.\"\nMr Biden is also facing growing domestic pressure to take a stronger line against Israel. In a New York Times public opinion survey this week, only 33% of registered American voters approved of the president's handling of the Israel-Palestinian conflict. A plurality, 44% to 39%, said Israel should end its military campaign.\nHeading into the 2024 presidential election year, the poll suggests the Biden administration is haemorrhaging support from key members of its electoral coalition. Among voters under 30, 46% said they sympathise more with the Palestinian side. Only 27% sided with the Israelis.\nSome prominent liberal members of the Democratic Party have pushed a resolution calling for a human rights report on Israel's use of American weapons that could potentially suspend US security assistance.\nVermont Senator Bernie Sanders, a left-wing independent who's an important ally of Joe Biden's, is sponsoring the resolution and has called Israeli conduct during the war \"reckless and immoral\".\nSeparately, a group of House Democrats with national security backgrounds has written to the White House arguing that Mr Netanyahu's military strategy is not in the interests of either Israel or the US.\nAnd there've been various expressions of dissent from within Mr Biden's own administration. More than 800 staff members have supported a letter calling for an immediate ceasefire, although most have done so anonymously, and only one has resigned.\n\"I felt a lot of dissonance between coming into work every single day and serving this administration that I had previously so proudly done, and then feeling this sort of vacuum where the influence of a call to a ceasefire (would be) massive coming from the US president and our boss,\" one staffer told the BBC.\nSuch sentiment underscores the difficult bind the US president finds himself in. Many world leaders, a significant number of administration insiders and about half the American public are increasingly unhappy with the current US strategy.\nBut if the president starts to get tougher with the Israelis, the other half of Americans that back Israel would almost certainly object - and there's still no guarantee that his current critics would be satisfied.\nScaling down the Israeli offensive is key. If it doesn't happen fast enough Mr Biden will have to seriously consider his next step.\nEspecially as the calendar will soon flip to 2024 - the last year of his first presidential term. Domestic politics, always a factor in US foreign policy, will increasingly become a pressing concern for the president.\nFor a man who promised a steady hand at the tiller after four years of Donald Trump's sometimes tumultuous foreign policy, the Gaza War has proven to be a formidable - and potentially grave - challenge to his political fortunes."}

Officers are yet to make any arrests.\nOne gallery owner told the BBC the artwork could be worth up to £500,000.\nSouthwark Council's Jasmine Ali said she had every confidence they would get it back.\n\"We are not just talking about a street sign here, it is a work of art which was put there for the community. \"It is street art and it is for the people,\" she said.\nThe Met said a new traffic sign had been put up to avoid endangering road users.\nA spokesman added: \"We are aware of footage being shared which shows the sign being removed\n\"Anyone who may have information about the incident or the whereabouts of the sign is asked to call police.\"\nOn Friday, one man described how he \"watched in awe\" as the sign was taken down at about 12:30 GMT. \nAlex, 26, said no-one knew what to do and \"we just watched it happen\".\nA man, held a Lime hire bike steady for another man who then stood up on its saddle and reached up and cut the artwork free.\nWrenching it off the post, he then ran down the street and out of sight.\nMatthew Uden, managing director of the nearby funeral directors, said: \"Having a piece of art by a famous street artist such as Banksy outside of our Camberwell branch was incredibly nice to see.\"\nHe said it was a shame it was no longer there.\nWhile the incident has been reported to the Met Police, art gallery owner John Brandler questioned whether it was a \"publicity stunt\".\n\"I think it if it came up at auction it would be worth £250,000 to £500,000.\n\"It could easily be higher. The media attention has made it more valuable.\n\"If I am being cynical, I think he did it as a Christmas present for someone.\"\nBanksy's Instagram followers widely interpreted his latest work as calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip after he confirmed the authenticity on his social media.\nSimilar drone art appeared at Banksy's Walled Off hotel in Bethlehem in 2017 which he said had \"the worst view of any hotel in the world\" - referencing Israel's controversial wall in the West Bank.\nProf Paul Gough, vice-chancellor of Arts University Bournemouth, explained Banksy's work \"always thrives on that ambiguity\". \n\"He rarely puts art there by accident,\" Prof Gough said.\n\"There are some 40,000 comments on his Instagram - yet he follows nobody - and you get a whole range of interpretations.\"\nUlrich Blanche, a street art expert with Heidelberg University, said Banksy's thought-provoking work is usually seen as making a \"political statement\".\nHe believes the location of Commercial Way, next to a funeral directors and the drones flying away paints a picture of the global arms trade.\nBut, although this Banksy will be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds, he said it might not be so straightforward to find a buyer.\n\"It is worth quite a lot of money.\" Mr Blanche added. \nHe said that whoever has it may find it difficult to sell because of how they came by it.\nBanksy has installed other pieces this year including Valentine's Day Mascara, a mural weighing 3.8 tonnes, which appeared on the side of a house in Margate, Kent, on Valentine's Day.\nIt depicted a 1950s housewife with a swollen eye and missing tooth, wearing an apron and yellow washing-up gloves, and throwing a man into a chest freezer.\nIn September it was placed in the foyer of The Art of Banksy exhibition in central London, where it can be viewed for free.\nFour years ago Banksy set up a shop in Croydon featuring the stab vest he designed for Stormzy's headline act at the Glastonbury festival."}

She had previously expected a Christmas due date.\nA UAB obstetrician confirmed that the trio were doing well, and told the BBC it was the sort of case that most people in her profession \"go through their entire careers and never see\".\nMs Hatcher was told at age 17 she had a double uterus (uterus didelphys) - which the UAB described as a rare congenital anomaly affecting 0.3% of women.\nAnd the odds of becoming pregnant in both uteri - a dicavitary pregnancy - were even slimmer, at \"one in a million\", according to the UAB.\nReported cases worldwide are extremely rare. In 2019, a doctor in Bangladesh told the BBC a woman had given birth to twins almost a month after delivering a premature baby in her other uterus.\nMs Hatcher had three previous, healthy pregnancies. This time, she believed herself to be pregnant in only one uterus - until a routine ultrasound revealed there was also a baby in her second. \n\"I gasped... We just could not believe it,\" she recalled.\nShe went on to document her unusual journey on Instagram. One update at 38 weeks asked: \"What the heck?! HOW have we made it this far?!\" \nThe UAB described her pregnancy as routine. Prof Richard Davis, who co-managed the delivery, pointed out that each baby had enjoyed \"extra space to grow and develop\".\nThis was because each baby had a womb to itself, he said - unlike in a typical twin pregnancy.\nMs Hatcher's labour was induced at 39 weeks, and required double the monitoring and charting at the hospital - as well as double the staffing.\nThis proved to be \"the most atypical\" part of Ms Hatcher's case, said Dr Shweta Patel from the hospital's obstetrics and gynaecology team.\nUAB staff did not have \"a lot of evidence or data\" to hand, Dr Patel told the BBC, and were required to apply their knowledge of typical pregnancies.\nSure enough, the babies had a \"mind of their own\", she said - and were delivered by different methods.\nThe first, Roxi, was born vaginally at about 19:45 local time on 19 December.

Officers are yet to make any arrests.\nOne gallery owner told the BBC the artwork could be worth up to £500,000.\nSouthwark Council's Jasmine Ali said she had every confidence they would get it back.\n\"We are not just talking about a street sign here, it is a work of art which was put there for the community. \"It is street art and it is for the people,\" she said.\nThe Met said a new traffic sign had been put up to avoid endangering road users.\nA spokesman added: \"We are aware of footage being shared which shows the sign being removed\n\"Anyone who may have information about the incident or the whereabouts of the sign is asked to call police.\"\nOn Friday, one man described how he \"watched in awe\" as the sign was taken down at about 12:30 GMT. \nAlex, 26, said no-one knew what to do and \"we just watched it happen\".\nA man, held a Lime hire bike steady for another man who then stood up on its saddle and reached up and cut the artwork free.\nWrenching it off the post, he then ran down the street and out of sight.\nMatthew Uden, managing director of the nearby funeral directors, said: \"Having a piece of art by a famous street artist such as Banksy outside of our Camberwell branch was incredibly nice to see.\"\nHe said it was a shame it was no longer there.\nWhile the incident has been reported to the Met Police, art gallery owner John Brandler questioned whether it was a \"publicity stunt\".\n\"I think it if it came up at auction it would be worth £250,000 to £500,000.\n\"It could easily be higher. The media attention has made it more valuable.\n\"If I am being cynical, I think he did it as a Christmas present for someone.\"\nBanksy's Instagram followers widely interpreted his latest work as calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip after he confirmed the authenticity on his social media.\nSimilar drone art appeared at Banksy's Walled Off hotel in Bethlehem in 2017 which he said had \"the worst view of any hotel in the world\" - referencing Israel's controversial wall in the West Bank.\nProf Paul Gough, vice-chancellor of Arts University Bournemouth, explained Banksy's work \"always thrives on that ambiguity\". \n\"He rarely puts art there by accident,\" Prof Gough said.\n\"There are some 40,000 comments on his Instagram - yet he follows nobody - and you get a whole range of interpretations.\"\nUlrich Blanche, a street art expert with Heidelberg University, said Banksy's thought-provoking work is usually seen as making a \"political statement\".\nHe believes the location of Commercial Way, next to a funeral directors and the drones flying away paints a picture of the global arms trade.\nBut, although this Banksy will be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds, he said it might not be so straightforward to find a buyer.\n\"It is worth quite a lot of money.\" Mr Blanche added. \nHe said that whoever has it may find it difficult to sell because of how they came by it.\nBanksy has installed other pieces this year including Valentine's Day Mascara, a mural weighing 3.8 tonnes, which appeared on the side of a house in Margate, Kent, on Valentine's Day.\nIt depicted a 1950s housewife with a swollen eye and missing tooth, wearing an apron and yellow washing-up gloves, and throwing a man into a chest freezer.\nIn September it was placed in the foyer of The Art of Banksy exhibition in central London, where it can be viewed for free.\nFour years ago Banksy set up a shop in Croydon featuring the stab vest he designed for Stormzy's headline act at the Glastonbury festival."}

But after today's decision, Mr Putin remains the only candidate to be able to register as a candidate.\nIn November, a nationalist pro-war blogger who had fiercely criticised Russia's military strategy in Ukraine, said he wanted to challenge Putin and disrupt the \"sham\" poll.\nIgor Girkin, 52, was detained in July following a series of social media posts critical of the president. He is now in jail awaiting trial for extremism, which he denies.\nMr Putin recently showed a rare example of caving in to popular pressure - by cutting the cost of buying chicken and eggs.

Islamic Jihad, a smaller group in the Gaza Strip, is among those known to also be holding Israeli hostages.\nThe Hamas statement puts the Israeli government in a very difficult position.\nIt has said it thinks the best way to get the release of hostages is military pressure on Hamas and by staging rescue operations.\nBut so far that approach has not really worked. Only one hostage - Ori Megidish - has actually been rescued.\nThe government is also under huge pressure from the relatives of the hostages still being held, with some telling it the strategy of force is not working.\nHamas is putting pressure on Israel to stop the war altogether but without any guarantee that the group is going to stop its armed actions.\nSo the Israeli government is extremely reluctant to stop fighting until it feels it has completely degraded Hamas capability and it has not done that yet.\nThis will be a huge disappointment for the people of Gaza, who are desperate for this war to stop.\nEarly on Friday, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry put the overall death toll there since 7 October at 20,057, including at least 8,000 children and 6,200 women.\nWhen Hamas and their allies broke through the heavily guarded perimeter with Israel on 7 October they killed 1,200 people."}

On Wednesday a convoy carrying aid from Jordan crossed into Gaza via Israel for the first time since the start of the war.\nHowaida Al-Daramali, a Palestinian woman who has been displaced to Khan Younis and who is also helping find shelter for other displaced families, said the limited aid being delivered \"only goes to one or two places\" and most people in Gaza were not receiving anything.\n\"We want this aid to be accompanied by teams who will be responsible for distributing it especially since the situation here is very difficult. Many people broke into the Red Crescent warehouses and looted them,\" she told the BBC.\nMeanwhile some families who were getting aid because they were in UN-run shelters were selling what they did not need at inflated prices, Ms al-Daramali said.\n\"Even with cash, there are no goods in the supermarket and no suppliers. We can buy only from people who receive aid and sell it at the school gates, which are dangerous places for us to reach,\" she said.\nPeople in Khan Younis were \"psychologically and economically devastated\", she said.\nThe UN Security Council is meanwhile trying to agree on a vote calling for more aid to get into Gaza. The vote has been delayed for several days over the wording of the text.\nThe US has expressed support for the latest draft resolution after earlier voicing \"widespread concerns\" with an earlier version that called for a ceasefire - something the US is against, saying it would only benefit Hamas.\nThe new draft aims to create a mechanism to accelerate aid but makes clear it would involve relevant parties such as Israel.\nIt also calls for all available routes to be used for deliveries but does not seek an immediate end to the fighting.\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, US Ambassador to the UN, described it as a \"very strong resolution that is fully supported by the Arab group\".\nMeanwhile, the fighting in and around Gaza continues. Hamas authorities on Thursday accused Israel of attacking the Rafah crossing - killing four people, including the director of the recently reopened Kerem Shalom crossing. Israel's military has not commented on the reported incident.\nTalks had been taking place in Egypt to reach a new truce - similar to the week-long pause in fighting last month that saw hostages released.\nBut on Thursday they suffered a setback when Hamas said it would not agree to a release of some hostages in exchange for a partial ceasefire.\nIt said Palestinian groups had rejected the prospect of more hostages being released until Israel agrees to end the war. Israel has repeatedly rejected a permanent ceasefire with Hamas, saying it aims to destroy the group.\nMore than 240 Israeli hostages were captured on 7 October when Hamas broke through the fortified perimeter with Israel, killing 1,200 people. A total of 110 hostages were released in the truce last month.\nEarlier this week, Hamas said the number of people killed in Gaza in 10 weeks of fighting had passed 20,000."}

After a backlash, the paper removed the article from its website, saying on X (formerly Twitter) that the report \"was based on faulty sourcing\".\nA few weeks earlier, a video of Israeli siblings Rotem Mathias, 16, and his two sisters, Shakked and Shir, went viral online. Rotem witnessed his parents get killed by Hamas gunmen on 7 October as they sheltered in their house in a kibbutz near the border with Gaza.\nThe viral video featured edited clips from the siblings' interviews with US outlets ABC and CNN days after the attack. It falsely claimed that they were \"crisis actors\" who were lying about their parents' deaths and struggling to hold their laughter in front of cameras.\nThese are just two examples - viewed millions of times each - showcasing the social media schism in the Israel-Gaza war that has brought denial of atrocities and human suffering to the forefront of online debate about the conflict.\nOne of the key terms used to deny or minimise human suffering in Gaza is \"Pallywood\", a disparaging combination of \"Palestine\" and \"Hollywood\". Its proponents claim fake or staged footage of Palestinian \"crisis actors\" posing as genuine civilian casualties is regularly shared online to influence public opinion and deceive global media.\nA BBC Verify analysis suggests that on X alone, the term \"Pallywood\" has seen the largest spike in the number of mentions in the past 10 years.\nDuring previous flare-ups of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in 2014, 2018 and 2021 the word \"Pallywood\" consistently peaked at either 9,500 or 13,000 mentions in a single month on X. After the 7 October Hamas attack, the number of mentions peaked at 220,000 in November.\nBBC Verify found that among those sharing the term \"Pallywood\" on social media in the past months, including X, Facebook and Instagram, were Israeli officials, celebrities and popular bloggers from Israel and the US.\nOn the other hand, while supporters of the Palestinians do not have a single term used to deny atrocities committed by Hamas on 7 October in Israel, posts making such claims routinely get millions of views on social media. Some falsely say that Hamas did not kill civilians on that day, or that the scale of civilian casualties has been massively exaggerated. Some even go further, falsely claiming that most of the victims were actually killed by the Israel Defense Forces, not Hamas.\nExperts specialising in reconciliation efforts worry that viral disinformation which denies the other side's suffering can be dehumanising, and may impact the longer-term prospects of mending the relations between the communities affected.\n\"The biggest risks, I think, are the erosion of trust and the erosion of empathy,\" said Harriet Vickers, programme lead at the Tim Parry and Johnathan Ball Foundation for Peace, a charity that supports victims of conflict, political violence and acts of terror.\n\"It undermines the ability to even begin approaching reconciliation efforts.\"\nShe added that false narratives and dehumanising rhetoric can also \"have a profound effect beyond those that are directly impacted by violence, and can actually further the hurt that is being done to those individuals\".\nFalse narratives about \"crisis actors\" or atrocity denial are not new to those who study disinformation.\nThe concept of \"crisis actors\" in particular - that is people who pretend or are paid to act out some particular tragedy or disaster - has been popular among promoters of conspiracy theories for years.\nIt was notoriously used to allege that parents of dead children in the Sandy Hook school shooting in the US were somehow faking their personal tragedies.\nIn the past few years similar viral claims were posted about the killing of Ukrainian civilians in Bucha, and victims of the war in Syria.\nBut the volume of dehumanising rhetoric posted during this war has surprised even those who deal with such content on a daily basis.\nEliot Higgins, the founder of the investigative website Bellingcat that has covered the wars in Syria and Ukraine in recent years, says the volume of disinformation in the current Israeli-Gaza war is \"unique to this conflict\".\n\"I've seen the kind of same intensity of toxicity and vile responses and disinformation, the way they treat women and children and that kind of stuff, with Syria, with Ukraine and so many different topics - just there are more people doing it,\" he told the BBC.\nMr Higgins added that because many people have had very strong opinions about either side of the conflict for years, \"there are more people who are sharing stuff because it is resonating with them emotionally\".\n\"They don't really care if it's true or not, it just feels true to them.\"\nBack in November, a video showing makeup and fake blood being applied to a child actor's face was posted on X by Ofir Gendelman, the Israeli prime minister's spokesperson to the Arab world.\n\"See for yourselves how they fake injuries and evacuating 'injured' civilians, all in front of the cameras. Pallywood gets busted again,\" Mr Gendelman said in a post that was viewed millions of times before being deleted.\nThe video was, in fact, behind-the-scenes footage from a 45-second Lebanese film made in tribute to Gazans and posted online in October.\nDirector Mahmoud Ramzi, who took to Instagram to personally debunk the false claim made about his film, told the BBC that in the end, the misinformation might have backfired, with the controversy helping his film reach a much bigger audience.\nThe BBC approached Mr Gendelman for comment but he has not responded.\nOthers have expressed concern for the real people who find themselves in the middle of online disinformation wars. James Longman, the ABC correspondent who interviewed Rotem and his sisters, says watching Rotem recount the death of his parents brought him and his cameraman to tears.\n\"He was in tears, his sister was in tears, their grandfather, who was with us. Our cameraman, the hospital porters, the nurses, the doctors, and I was in tears. I mean all of us sitting there listening to what he had to say,\" he told the BBC.\n\"It was extraordinary to hear him say it, to watch his reactions as he explained what had happened.\"\nMr Longman said he was shocked when he saw false claims about the siblings being shared online and took to X to debunk it. His post was shared widely, and led to at least one of the viral messages about the siblings being subsequently deleted by the person who posted it.\n\"But it doesn't make it any less horrible for Rotem's family,\" Mr Longman said."}

The BBC Arabic cameraman shares a vivid and shocking account of what he, his wife and children experienced as they headed south.\nWarning: This story contains graphic descriptions which may be distressing\nWe left in such a hurry. We were in the middle of baking some bread and realised the houses opposite us were being bombed, one by one. I knew it would soon be our turn. We had packed some bags in case this happened but everything was so rushed we forgot to take them. We didn't even shut the front door.\nWe had waited to leave because we didn't want to move my elderly parents and we had taken years to save up to build our house in al-Zeitoun, but in the end we had to go. My baby son, Omar, died there in November 2012, killed when shrapnel hit our house in another war with Israel and I couldn't risk losing any more children.\nI knew that in the south there was no electricity, no water and people had to queue for hours to use a toilet. But in the end, grabbing just a bottle of water and some leftover bread, we joined thousands of others making the dangerous journey down the Salah al-Din road to the south, where Israel said it was safe.\nLots of my family walked together - my wife Ahlam, our four sons, who are two, eight, nine and 14 years old, my parents, brothers, sisters, cousins and their children.\nWe walked for hours and knew that eventually we would have to go through an Israeli checkpoint that was set up during the war. We were nervous and my children kept asking: \"What will the army do to us?\"\nWe came to a stop about two-thirds of a mile (1km) from the checkpoint and joined a huge queue of people that filled the entire road. We spent more than four hours waiting there and my father fainted three times.\nThere were Israeli soldiers watching us from bombed-out buildings on one side of the road and more on an empty plot of land on the other side.\nAs we edged closer to the checkpoint we saw more soldiers above us in a tent on a hill. We think they managed the checkpoint remotely from there, watching us through binoculars and using loudspeakers to tell us what to do.\nThere were two open-sided shipping containers near the tent. All the men had to pass through one and the women through the other, with cameras constantly trained on us. When we had gone through, Israeli soldiers asked to see our IDs and we were photographed.\nIt was like judgement day.\nI saw about 50 people detained, all men, including two of my neighbours. One young man was stopped because he had lost his documents and couldn't remember his ID number. Another man next to me in the queue was called a terrorist by an Israeli soldier, before he too was taken away.\nThey were told to strip down to their underwear and sit on the ground. Some were later asked to get dressed and leave, while others were blindfolded.\nI saw four blindfolded detainees, including my neighbours, taken behind a sand hill by a demolished building. When they were out of sight, we heard gunfire. I have no idea whether they were shot or not.\nSeparately, other people who made the same journey as me were contacted by a colleague of mine in Cairo. One of them, Kamal Aljojo, said that just after he went through the checkpoint a week earlier, he had seen dead bodies, but he didn't know how they had died.\nMy colleague also spoke to a man called Muhammed who went through the same checkpoint on 13 November. \"A soldier asked me to strip off all of my clothes, even my underwear,\" Muhammed told the BBC. He added: \"I was naked in front of everyone walking past. I felt ashamed. Suddenly a female soldier pointed her gun at me and laughed before quickly moving it away. I was humiliated.\" Muhammed said he had to wait naked for about two hours before he was allowed to go.\nAlthough my wife, children, parents and I all got through the checkpoint safely, two of my brothers were delayed.\nWhile we were waiting for them, an Israeli soldier shouted at a group of people in front of us who were trying to go back towards the containers to check on their relatives, who had been held up.\nHe used a loudspeaker to tell them to move on and to stay at least 300yds (300m) away, then a soldier started shooting in the air in their direction to intimidate them. We had heard a lot of gunshots while we were queueing.\nEveryone was crying and my mother was sobbing: \"What happened to my sons? Did they shoot them?\"\nAfter well over an hour my brothers finally appeared.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that \"individuals suspected of affiliations with terrorist organisations\" were detained for preliminary inquiries, and if they remained suspects they were transferred to Israel for further questioning. Others were \"promptly released\", it said.\nIt said clothes had to be removed to check for explosive vests or other weapons and detainees were clothed as soon possible. It said it did not aim to \"undermine the security and dignity of the detainees\" and that the IDF \"operates in accordance with international law\".\nThe IDF also said it \"does not shoot at civilians moving along the humanitarian corridor from the north to the south\", but when young men tried to move in the opposite direction they \"were met with shots for the purposes of dispersal, after they were told with a loudspeaker not to advance towards the position of the troops and continued to do so\".\nIt added that the sound of shooting was common and \"the sound of gunfire alone does not constitute an indication of shooting from a specific place or of a certain type\".\nMy wife and I felt relieved as we moved on and the checkpoint disappeared from sight behind us, but we had no idea that the hardest part of the journey was yet to come.\nAs we walked further south, I saw about 10 bodies in different places by the roadside.\nOther scattered, rotting body parts, were covered in flies with birds pecking at the remains. They gave off one of the foulest smells I have ever experienced.\nI couldn't bear the thought of my children seeing them so I screamed at the top of my lungs, telling them to look at the sky and keep walking.\nI saw a burned-out car with a severed human head inside. The hands of the headless rotting corpse were still holding the steering wheel.\nThere were also bodies of dead donkeys and horses, some reduced to skeletons, and huge piles of rubbish and spoiled food.\nThen an Israeli tank appeared on a side road, moving towards us at breakneck speed. We were frightened and in order to get away, we had to run over corpses. Some people in the crowd tripped on the bodies. The tank changed course about 20yds (20m) before it reached the main road.\nSuddenly, next to the road, a building was bombed. The explosion was terrifying and shrapnel flew everywhere.\nI wanted the world to swallow us up.\nWe were shaken and exhausted but carried on towards Nuseirat camp. We arrived there in the evening and had to sleep on the pavement. It was freezing.\nWe put my jacket around our middle sons, tucking their hands into the sleeves to try to keep them warm. We covered our youngest with my shirt. I have never been so cold in all my life.\nWhen the BBC asked about the tank and the bodies, the IDF said that \"during the day, tanks move on routes that intersect with the Salah al-Din road, but there was no case in which tanks moved towards civilians moving from north to south of the Gaza Strip on the humanitarian corridor\".\nThe IDF said it did not know of any cases of piles of corpses on the Salah al-Din road but there were times when Gazan vehicles \"abandoned bodies during the journey, which the IDF subsequently evacuated\".\nThe next morning we set off early for Khan Younis, Gaza's second largest city. We paid someone to take us part of the way in a cart pulled by a donkey. Then at Deir al-Balah, we got on a bus that was only meant to carry 20 people, but 30 people got on board. Some sat on the roof and others clung to the doors and windows from the outside.\nIn Khan Younis, we tried to find a safe place to stay at a UN-run school that had been turned into a shelter, but it was full. We ended up renting a warehouse under a residential building instead and stayed there for a week.\nMy parents, brother and sisters decided to stay in Khan Younis, but after the local market was bombed, my wife and I decided to take our children further south to Rafah to be with her family. They managed to get a lift in a car and I joined them later by bus, but it was so full I had to hang on to the outside of the door.\nWe are now renting a small outhouse with a roof made of tin and plastic. There is nothing to protect us from falling shrapnel.\nEverything is expensive and we can't get many of the things we need. If we want drinking water, we have to queue for three hours and we don't have enough food for three meals a day, so we don't eat lunch any more, only breakfast and dinner.\nMy son used to have an egg every day. An egg - can you imagine? I can't even give him that now. All I want to do is leave Gaza and be safe with my children, even if that means living in a tent.\nAdditional reporting by BBC News Arabic's Abdelrahman Abutaleb in Cairo."}

In the aftermath, the government promised money to help rebuild. But as they prepare for Christmas, many here are still living with the damage and shock of the attack.\nThe Christmas carol procession lurches its way through Jaranwala's back streets, gathering singers as we go. \nWe start at the church, the pastor, two drummers, 15 or so enthusiastic singers, lighting the way through the dark streets with phone torches. With each turn more come to their doors to join. \nChildren are dressed in their Christmas best, some belting out their favourite carol lines. Others shyly join in, dressed in sparkly dresses with glittery bows, Father Christmas hats and light-up trainers, stomping through the streets. Some of the older boys throw small firecrackers, giggling as their mothers shout at them for making them jump.  \nChristmas traditions in Jaranwala have a renewed importance to Pastor Rizwan Mill this year. \n\"Christmas now is in all our hearts,\" he says, taking a small break from leading the congregation. \"Christ is a saviour for me. He saved me during the hours of the attack. He is all our saviour.\" \nOn 16 August, thousands gathered in Jaranwala, angry at allegations that someone from the Christian community had deliberately damaged pages from the holy Quran. People were being accused of blasphemy. \nThe crowd turned violent, attacking churches and private homes. Many from the Christian community fled, spending the night in open fields, fearful of returning to the city. While nine police officers were injured, no civilian lives were lost. \nThe police promised justice, arresting more than 350 people, while the government promised to help rebuild both trust and the buildings. \nThe authorities have said that all 22 churches that were attacked have now been renovated and reopened - the walls are still crisp with fresh paint and the floors have that new carpet smell. \nAlongside money from the government, there have been works and donations by charities, NGOs and outreach programmes between local mosques and churches. \nBut four months later, some homes still show the scars of that night.\nWe find Saima sitting in the one room of her home still intact, surrounded by blackened walls. The money has been paid, she says, but once divided amongst all the relatives who live in the building, it wasn't enough. The damage was extensive and the repair work is taking time. \n\"This was a very beautiful house,\" she tells me. \n\"My parents built it, they saved every penny for it. It takes a whole lifetime to build a house. And now it's all burnt. Whatever we had, it's all burnt.\"\nShe says the whole household - including her, her siblings and their children, four families in total - were given two million rupees, around $7,100 (£5,586).  \nSome of that money has gone on rent for those who can't stay in the house. Now it is just Saima and one sister-in-law that live in the only habitable room. \n\"We are so tired,\" she tells me quietly. She begins to cry. \"In this one room, there is no facility, there is no light, no water, we don't have anything. We just want this house to be rebuilt.\"\nThe authorities in Jaranwala told the BBC that 78 households were identified by a damage assessment committee and given two million rupees each. The amount, they stated, was decided after examining the damage of each house.  \nAcross the road, work is still underway at Sonam's house. \nWhen we visited in August, one bedroom was still smouldering, another had a broken window. The bed had been thrown from the first floor to the street. \nNow the rooms are repainted, with new furniture - although the bedroom door still has blunt holes, hacked into the wood by rioters. The memories too are still close to the surface. \n\"We don't feel safe here,\" Sonam says. \n\"The fear that entered our hearts is still there. Any shouting in the street, everyone goes out to see what is happening because we are so scared. It's very hard to trust again.\"\n\"As a society and as a police force we have to rebuild trust,\" says Captain Ali Zia, city police officer. \"Both have already done a lot to do that.\" \nBut there is still some lingering anger. \nAt the time of the attacks, some criticised the police for failing to stop the damage or step in before the crowd got of control. \n\"Our first priority was to save lives,\" says Captain Zia. \"The second was to save property. Nine of the police officials were injured that day; the police did take the brunt. By and large we do have people's trust.\" \nPolice say around a quarter of the 350 originally arrested are still in prison. The others are out on bail, but authorities are adamant cases will still be brought against them. \n\"There is a process of law,\" Captain Zia says. \"The police department and the government are two of the biggest stakeholders here. We want to show that this act won't be tolerated in the future. If we don't ensure justice, it will keep happening.\" \nCaptain Zia says he hopes the court cases will start early in 2024. Until then, the police are loath to be drawn on details of both the blasphemy case and the violent mob. But of the violence in the streets, police say there is no indication that the reaction was pre-planned and instead believe the call to protest was spontaneously spread through social media. \nIn Jaranwala, the carol procession finally winds its way back to the church where it began. \nThe children begin to show their carefully rehearsed Christmas dance routines, performing on a stage papered with pictures of snow men, Christmas trees and Father Christmas. \nIn August this was one of the churches still smouldering hours later. \n\"We still feel that moment,\" Saima tells me. \"But we hope that whatever has passed has passed. That is what we want. That is what we pray for.\" "}

Self-funding was my only option,\" Bazawule wrote on crowdfunding site Kickstarter, as he attempted to raise more money for post-production.\nThrough magical realism, The Burial of Kojo tells the story of a young girl on a mission to look for her father after he goes missing while working in a gold mine in Ghana. The film was shot in the country with a local cast, who speak Twi throughout most of the film.\nBazawule composed and performed the score for The Burial of Kojo, telling the BBC after the film's 2018 premiere: \"Making film is, I believe, the quintessential mix of all creative endeavours - you get to be a bit of a writer, you get to be a bit of a visual artist, you get to be a bit of a musician, all in one.\"\nDespite not possessing formal training or funding from traditional sources, Bazawule's debut film caught the eye of Hollywood titan Ava DuVernay, director of projects like Selma and When They See Us.\nAfter her company Array picked up The Burial of Kojo's distribution rights, it became the first Ghanaian-produced film to stream on Netflix.\nBazawule received widespread critical acclaim, with the New York Times praising \"a near-virtuoso work, a feast of emotion, nuance and beauty, and a startling feature directing debut\".\nAnd film critics were not the only ones who were impressed. According to Bazawule, it was after watching The Burial of Kojo on Netflix that Beyoncé invited him on board her own cinematic effort, Black Is King.\nReleased in 2020, it serves as a visual companion to Beyoncé's soundtrack for the 2019 Lion King reboot.\nThe film celebrates black identity and female empowerment, while showcasing talent and culture from across Africa.\nBazawule went on to bag a Grammy nomination for his work on the project.\nAfter entering the fields of film and music, Bazawule then crossed the frontier into literature.\nHis 2022 novel, The Scent of Burnt Flowers, follows a couple who seek asylum in Ghana after fleeing persecution in 1960s America.\nIt is reportedly being adapted into a six-episode TV series - with Bazawule writing, directing and producing.\nFor Bazawule, key to his take on Celie, the character at the centre of The Color Purple, is her fertile imagination - using that to show how she overcomes abuse and trauma.\n\"She's working in her head to liberate herself,\" he said in an interview in the run-up to the film's release.\nThe Color Purple is also said to have African musical influences thanks to Bazawule - and he remains inspired by stories from his birthplace despite not having lived there for decades.\nHe encourages other African creatives to bring their countries to the big screen, addressing filmmakers in his interview with the BBC.\n\"Look inward, look at what we have on the continent. Visually, it's unmatched. So know what you have, do the work and believe,\" he said.\nYou may be interested in:"}

It is a super little village.\"\nFor those who remember the movie, that certainly sounds more than a little bit like Bedford Falls."}

But on the day the babies were due, war broke out and the little girls were born to the sound of Russian shells falling around them.\nWhen Hanna went for her first ultrasound scan, it showed a small dot - the baby she and Andriy had planned for so long. But on their next visit to the doctor they were told they were expecting twins. The third visit revealed she was actually pregnant with triplets.\n\"We were afraid to see the doctor for the fourth appointment,\" Hanna jokes. But the couple were happy. \"We really wanted children. God had heard us and gave us three at once,\" she tells the Ukrainecast podcast.\nHanna went into a maternity hospital in Chernihiv on 23 February 2022 for a Caesarean section, which was scheduled for the next morning.\nRumours about a Russian invasion had been spreading for a while but she did not believe them until early on 24 February when she got a message from her brother, who was studying at a military school. He told her that the war had started and he did not know where he was going to be sent. He urged her to leave Chernihiv.\nBut she could not leave straight away. Her operation was planned for 09:00 and the hospital staff were preparing to deliver their first triplets in three years.\nHanna could not believe the war had begun: \"I thought it would happen somewhere far away, in a field, a forest, but not in our lives.\"\nAndriy arrived at the hospital at 06:00 carrying suitcases filled with clothes and other supplies and tried to calm her down. \"He said that the main thing was to bring our children into this world,\" Hanna recalls.\nThe babies were born just minutes apart: Emilia at 09:36, Olivia at 09:37 and at 09:38 it was Melania's turn. \"I couldn't imagine they would be so beautiful,\" says Hannah.\nTen minutes later, at 09:48, the Ukrainian state border service officially announced that Russian military vehicles had entered the Chernihiv region.\nChernihiv is in northern Ukraine on the border with Belarus - where Russian troops invaded from - and was immediately hit by shelling. Although Russia did not occupy the city, it was badly damaged.\nOn the evening after she gave birth, recovering from surgery and barely able to get out of bed, Hanna was told to go down to a bomb shelter with her babies. \"I was totally lost. I didn't understand how I would get there,\" she says.\nTo reach it, she had to go outside, where the temperature was close to zero. The nurses wrapped the babies in warm blankets and carried them for her.\nThere were about 100 people with newborns in the shelter and hospital staff delivered 20 babies down there, they later told Ukrainian media.\nAlthough Hanna's daughters were healthy, they were premature. Normally, they would have been put in a special incubator, but there wasn't one in the shelter, so the nurses took it in turns to cuddle them under their clothes to keep them warm.\n\"The girls were so defenceless. I was lying next to them and didn't know how to help them,\" Hanna says, her voice trembling.\nThey were tiny - Emilia and Melania weighed just 3.5lb and 3lb (1.6kg and 1.4kg), but Olivia was even smaller. She was 2.5lb (1.1kg) and she needed to be moved to the intensive care unit if she was going to survive.\nHanna and Andriy decided they couldn't send her there alone, so after a week in the bomb shelter the whole family moved up to the hospital's first floor.\nOlivia was in intensive care for about two weeks. \"We stayed in the hospital's corridor with the other two girls and only went down to the basement when there were massive explosions,\" says Hanna.\nAt one point, Hanna was sitting in a corridor with Emilia and Melania, when she suddenly saw a massive flash followed by pitch darkness and smoke.\n\"I jumped up and grabbed my children, not knowing whether I was dead or alive,\" she says.\nThen she saw Andriy running towards her and they rushed to the intensive care room to see if Olivia had been hurt.\nThey ran past shattered windows, blown-off doors and destroyed walls. But luckily Olivia's room had not been touched and she was safe.\nFinally, on 20 March the family left the hospital and with the help of volunteers were evacuated to Kyiv.\nThe journey, which would normally have taken two hours, took five as they had to take a roundabout route to avoid Russian troops.\nThey later spent a few months in Slovakia before returning to their hometown.\nAll that time, Hanna was desperate for her father Anatolii to meet his granddaughters. He was fighting in the Ukrainian army and his messages were a source of huge strength.\n\"He kept saying: 'Hold on, I'm protecting you, I'm defending you. We will fight the Russians off,'\" she recalls.\nAfter Russian forces withdrew from the Chernihiv region in April 2022, Anatolii was sent to eastern Ukraine.\nThe family hoped he would come home in time for the girls' first birthday, but he never made it. On 11 January 2023 he was killed on the front line near Terny village in Donetsk. He was 51 years old.\n\"I keep thinking that the war will end and he will come home from the battlefield,\" says Hanna with tears in her eyes. \"I can't believe that our whole family won't be together.\"\nShe and Andriy compare the first year of their babies' lives to \"a scary movie\", but they say that thanks to the girls, there has also been a lot of love and happiness - \"three times more\".\nListen to the full story on BBC Ukrainecast"}

They must submit applications to the justice department.\nThe Democratic president's action expands on an executive order from last year, when his administration pardoned thousands of people who were convicted under federal law of possessing small amounts of marijuana.\nTwenty-four states and Washington DC have decriminalised or legalised marijuana use in some or all circumstances. But it remains illegal at the federal level.\nEarlier this year, the Health and Human Services Administration recommended that the Drug Enforcement Administration loosen federal restrictions on marijuana.\nMr Biden's order does not cover individuals who have been convicted of state-level crimes, but he urged governors to take similar action.\nSarah Gersten, executive director and general counsel for the Last Prisoner Project, called the executive order \"largely symbolic\".\n\"As the president has acknowledged, the vast majority of people convicted of cannabis are at the state level,\" Ms Gersten said.\nShe added that while \"the number of people who have federal offences are very low, a pardon at the federal level doesn't effectuate the kind of record clearance we want to see\".\nThe order also did not cover other marijuana-related offences that carry prison time.\nIt would not pardon, for example, Stephanie Shepard, the director of advocacy for the Last Prisoners Project.\nShe was imprisoned for conspiracy to distribute marijuana several years ago. The sentence continues to affect her life, and she noted that individuals with criminal records may struggle to find housing or jobs because a conviction will appear on a background check.\n\"I really wish he [Mr Biden] would just sit down and talk to someone who has an incarcerated parent, that has grown up without their parent because they're incarcerated, but at the same time can now walk down the street and see multiple dispensaries selling the same plant that their parents did,\" she said.\nThe executive order, in Ms Shepard's view, was \"just not enough\"."}

I absolutely love my job,\" she said.\nDr Payne was working for the Care Quality Commission when she got chatting to another doctor who worked in the Orkney islands in Scotland.\n\"I was like, 'Wow, that sort of island job would be my dream but it would never be practical, I've got two kids and my husband works full-time.' And she said, 'No, no, no, hear me out, my job is amazing and we're recruiting.'\"\nDr Payne has now been working for NHS Orkney for four years, often flying between the archipelago's islands.\nShe is on a rota with seven other doctors who each spend one week in eight in Orkney.\nShe spends the rest of her time working from home in Cardiff as a researcher for Oxford University and occasionally working on other islands as a locum - a doctor used to temporarily fill shifts.\nWorking in remote settings brings with it some very particular challenges.\n\"Some of the small islands I work on you might be the only healthcare professional, so your job involves everything from managing emergencies, sorting out helicopters, managing asthma, collecting medication from the ferry, taking blood and taking it to the aeroplane for collection.\n\"It's whatever comes in through the door type of medicine... from a kid who's got a bead up their nose to somebody who's had a massive heart attack.\"\nPoor weather conditions mean getting on or off an island is not always straightforward.\nShe was once trapped on Eday, one of the islands of Orkney, over new year because a big storm meant her plane was cancelled.\nShe said something common to island communities was people not seeking help as soon as they should.\n\"Sometimes, particularly farmers, will try treating themselves that little bit longer than maybe they should and so people sometimes come in a lot more poorly than they might in other settings,\" she explained.\nDr Payne said the worst situation was somebody deteriorating in a storm and needing a helicopter retrieval.\n\"You'd get them into hospital sooner rather than later on an island setting... everything happens two steps sooner in order to avoid a really sick patient in a really remote location,\" she said.\nIn her four years in the job, Dr Payne has developed a real love for Orkney.\n\"It's just the most magical place you can imagine,\" she said.\n\"The light is amazing... it's got this kind of otherworldliness to it.\"\nShe added patients there really appreciated their doctors.\n\"They know it's not easy to get doctors there, particularly in bad weather and to work somewhere where people are just grateful is so rewarding,\" she said.\nWhen she works on Barra in the Outer Hebrides, an island chain off the west coast of mainland Scotland, her plane has to land on the beach - \"just one of the most incredible experiences of my life\".\nLast summer she fulfilled a dream to spend a month in the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic Ocean approximately 400 miles (650km) off South America.\nHer job involved covering the hospital, A&E and out of hours GP services - her two teenage children and husband were even able to join her for part of it.\nAbout 10 minutes away from the archipelago's only hospital - King Edward VII Hospital - Gentoo penguins can be seen on the beach.\nThe family were able to watch them come in from the sea on their bellies and waddle across the beaches fast as they could to avoid patrolling sealions.\n\"They were just the cutest,\" said Dr Payne.\n\"You wake up and think 'did it really happened?' Was I dreaming from the minute I turned up at Brize Norton to take an RAF flight?'.\"\nAbout 10% of the population of the Falkland Islands live on islands that cover an area about two-thirds of the size of Wales.\nShe described one particular shift when she was working as the flying doctor covering the islands as \"one of the best days of my entire life\".\nThere are no scheduled flights to the smaller islands so people email where they want to go or what they need to be transported and a timetable for the eight-seater Britten-Norman Islander aircraft is constructed around that.\nOn this particular shift she was sitting next to the pilot with a sheep shearer and noisy cat on the way back to being reunited with its owner, but the flight was also used to help a farmer find some missing cows from the air.\nAfter taking blood in the back of a 4x4, there were stops to drop off the cat and house calls to see three more patients.\nThe landing strip was muddy so instead they landed on the beach, doing a fly-over first to scare off any penguins.\n\"I was thinking, 'I cannot believe I could be sitting in a surgery somewhere or I could be wild and free and looking out for penguins on a beach after delivering healthcare to the remotest communities in the world',\" she said.\nOn another memorable day in the Falkland Islands the family drove across beaches and moors in a 4x4 to visit Volunteer Point to see penguins.\n\"There were penguins everywhere, there were king penguins sitting in little groups with all the babies in the middle and the adults around them keeping them safe... totally unforgettable,\" she said.\nWhat can the rest of the world learn from the way healthcare is delivered on islands?\n\"I've never been on an island yet where I felt like a bad doctor because generally you have the time and the setup that allows you to deliver great care, and that gets me out of bed in the morning,\" said Dr Payne.\n\"There are many islands where people living there don't have access to a hospital without getting on a ferry... it's the amazing general practice they receive that makes the difference.\"\nDr Payne will be in the Orkney islands with her family this Christmas and then she her sights on St Helena, a remote volcanic outpost in the South Atlantic Ocean.\nShe believes jobs like hers are \"the real antidote to people getting midcareer blues and thinking about early retirement\".\n\"Mixing it up and using your skills in a different setting can really bring the love back for what we do and so I would say to colleagues that are maybe feelings burnt out or disillusioned to just go for a short locum at one of these places, try something really different, because it really can bring the joy back.\"\nShe added: \"I get to be in these amazing places, working with incredible people and being able to make a difference when it matters most.\""}

Her classmate and roommate, Sun Wei, was investigated but not charged.\nMs Sun was investigated by police in 1997 but was cleared as a suspect due to a lack of evidence.\nShe has repeatedly taken to social media to declare her innocence, and also changed her name.\nIn late 1994, Zhu Ling began experiencing stomach pains and hair loss and she fell into a coma months later.\nDoctors later diagnosed her with thallium poisoning, a soft metal which dissolves in water and is odourless and tasteless.\nReports have claimed Ms Sun had access to the thallium compound but she has said she was not the only student with access to the toxic substance.\nZhu Ling's family and supporters have suggested a possible motive was that Ms Sun was envious of her beauty and her musical and academic achievements.\nMs Sun has denied personal animosity between herself and Ms Zhu.\nA 2013 petition demanded the US investigate Ms Sun and have her deported from the United States, where she was living.\nThe petition described Ms Sun's family as having powerful political connections, and it was alleged she \"had the motive, and access to the deadly chemical\".\nThe White House responded to the petition and said it declined to comment on the request, but said Zhu Ling's poisoning \"was a tragedy\".\nIt read: \"No young person deserves to suffer as she has, and we can understand the heartbreak of those close to her.\"\nIn 2013, the Beijing Public Security Bureau defended its investigation but said the amount of time that had passed, alongside the small amount of evidence, limited its ability to reopen the case.\nMedia reports have said there was speculation that Ms Sun was protected from prosecution because of her grandfather Sun Yueqi, a senior Chinese official, and another relative, a former vice mayor of Beijing.\nMs Sun said her grandfather had died by the time she was questioned by police.\nThe police rejected claims that its inquiry had been influenced by others. In 2013 police said: \"The dedicated investigation team worked according to law, and the investigation was never compromised or interfered with in any way.\""}

Any minus can always be turned into a plus. Any experience is still an experience,\" she told Ms Duntsova, 40, after the decision.\nThe former TV journalist had declared she would run for the presidency in November. At the time, she told the Reuters news agency: \"Any sane person taking this step would be afraid - but fear must not win.\"\nRussia's constitution was amended in 2020, increasing the presidential term from four to six years and giving Mr Putin a clean slate to run again by cancelling out his previous terms.\nMoscow has sidelined opposition figures for years, and President Putin is expected to win in March; the Kremlin claims he enjoys genuine support among Russians.\nMs Duntsova had been vocal on her plans to run a campaign on ending the war in Ukraine and freeing political prisoners.\nShe was quick to respond after the commission's decision. \"We will appeal to the Supreme Court, since this decision is not based on the law,\" a message on her Telegram channel said.\nThe commission said 29 people have so far filed to run for the presidency. But after today's decision, Mr Putin remains the only candidate to be able to register as a candidate.\nIn November, a nationalist pro-war blogger who had fiercely criticised Russia's military strategy in Ukraine, said he wanted to challenge Putin and disrupt the \"sham\" poll.\nIgor Girkin, 52, was detained in July following a series of social media posts critical of the president. He is now in jail awaiting trial for extremism, which he denies.\nMr Putin recently showed a rare example of caving in to popular pressure - by cutting the cost of buying chicken and eggs. On a public phone-in, a caller berated the Russian president for the high price she was having to pay.\nWith just three months to go until the election, President Putin has now decided that eggs and chicken should be exempt from all import taxes."}

She had previously expected a Christmas due date.\nA UAB obstetrician confirmed that the trio were doing well, and told the BBC it was the sort of case that most people in her profession \"go through their entire careers and never see\".\nMs Hatcher was told at age 17 she had a double uterus (uterus didelphys) - which the UAB described as a rare congenital anomaly affecting 0.3% of women.\nAnd the odds of becoming pregnant in both uteri - a dicavitary pregnancy - were even slimmer, at \"one in a million\", according to the UAB.\nReported cases worldwide are extremely rare. In 2019, a doctor in Bangladesh told the BBC a woman had given birth to twins almost a month after delivering a premature baby in her other uterus.\nMs Hatcher had three previous, healthy pregnancies. This time, she believed herself to be pregnant in only one uterus - until a routine ultrasound revealed there was also a baby in her second. \n\"I gasped... We just could not believe it,\" she recalled.\nShe went on to document her unusual journey on Instagram. One update at 38 weeks asked: \"What the heck?! HOW have we made it this far?!\" \nThe UAB described her pregnancy as routine. Prof Richard Davis, who co-managed the delivery, pointed out that each baby had enjoyed \"extra space to grow and develop\".\nThis was because each baby had a womb to itself, he said - unlike in a typical twin pregnancy.\nMs Hatcher's labour was induced at 39 weeks, and required double the monitoring and charting at the hospital - as well as double the staffing.\nThis proved to be \"the most atypical\" part of Ms Hatcher's case, said Dr Shweta Patel from the hospital's obstetrics and gynaecology team.\nUAB staff did not have \"a lot of evidence or data\" to hand, Dr Patel told the BBC, and were required to apply their knowledge of typical pregnancies.\nSure enough, the babies had a \"mind of their own\", she said - and were delivered by different methods.\nThe first, Roxi, was born vaginally at about 19:45 local time on 19 December. The second, named Rebel, came by C-section more than 10 hours later. \nProf Davis said the girls could be called fraternal twins - a term used when each baby develops from a separate egg, each fertilised by a separate sperm.\n\"At the end of the day, it was two babies in one belly at the same time,\" he said. \"They just had different apartments.\""}

The aim of this channel is to reach 100,000 subscribers, or 500,000, or one million,\" he says.\nHe ends the short video saying \"peace out\" before walking out of view.\nJust over a year later, Awni became one of the first Palestinian children to be killed in the war.\nRelatives say Awni's family home was hit in an Israeli strike on 7 October, just hours after Hamas gunmen stormed across the border into Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 240 hostage.\nAwni's introductory video, in which he says thank you to his 1,000 subscribers, now has more than four million views. Other videos in which he voicelessly plays racing, battle and football games have millions more collectively.\nHis subscriber count has reached almost 1.5 million and continues to grow.\nComments flood in. \"Please forgive us, I wish we knew you before you died,\" one message says. Awni is a \"bird in heaven\", says another.\nTo his aunt, Ala'a, he was a \"very happy and confident\" boy who would hold the door open for her. Another family member called him \"engineer Awni\" because of his love of computers.\nTo others, this 13-year-old gamer has become a kind of symbol, representing the loss of children across the Gaza Strip.\nThe Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 20,000 people there have been killed since the war began - more than a third of them children. The UN children's agency (Unicef) has described it as the \"most dangerous place in the world to be a child\".\nThe day of the Hamas attack, as Israel began to retaliate, Ala'a imagined a bomb destroying her family's home in Gaza City. That night, she says her phone lit up with messages from friends: Awni's family home had been hit, at around 20:20.\nThe three-storey building was in the Zeitoun neighbourhood and a different branch of the family lived on each floor.\nOne was home to Awni, his mum and dad, his two older sisters, and two younger brothers.\nThe strike was also documented in October by human rights group Amnesty International.\n\"Two bombs fell suddenly on top of the building and destroyed it. My wife and I were lucky to survive because we were staying on the top floor,\" Awni's uncle Mohammed said.\nBoth he and a neighbour said they had received no warning. \"It was sudden, boom,\" the neighbour said.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not comment on this specific strike but said it was striking military targets and that Hamas had a \"documented practice of operating from nearby, underneath and within densely populated areas\".\nIt said: \"The IDF's strikes on military targets are subject to relevant provisions of international law, including the taking of feasible precautions and after an assessment that the expected incidental damage to civilians and civilian property is not excessive in relation to the expected military advantage from the attack.\"\nIt added that the IDF \"regrets any harm caused to civilians or civilian property as a result of its operations, and examines all its operations in order to learn and improve and ensure all activity was in accordance with operational procedures and the law\".\nAla'a didn't want to believe the messages she was receiving. But after connecting to the wi-fi, she saw that a close friend of the family had shared a photo of her brother on social media with the caption: \"Rest in peace.\" She ran to the hospital.\n\"They asked me to see the bodies but my husband refused… he wanted me to remember their beautiful faces when they were alive,\" she says in a Facebook message, sent from the south of Gaza, where she is now displaced.\nAla'a says 15 members of her family were killed that night, among them Awni.\nShe describes him as being a calm, helpful boy. His dad was a computer engineer and Ala'a says that for as long as she can remember, Awni would copy his father, pulling laptops apart and then trying to piece them back together.\nIn photos Awni shared on his own Facebook page, he stands in front of a blackboard holding up a computer motherboard to fellow students, as he leads a technology lesson organised as part of a \"little teachers\" scheme. Pictures published on his school's Facebook page show him winning numerous awards.\nShortly after his death, one of his teachers shared a photo with Awni, describing the boy's \"ever-lasting smile\".\nOutside of school, Ala'a says Awni loved spending time with his family. On one \"very wonderful night\", Ala'a says she watched a film with Awni and his siblings, sharing crisps and chocolates.\nThe last time she saw him was at a family breakfast three weeks before his death, where she looked at her nephew and said: \"Awni is becoming a man.\"\nMostly, Awni loved computers and gaming, and he idolised the YouTubers who made careers out of his hobby.\n\"He wanted to be like them - to have followers and fans,\" Ala'a says.\nAwni started his channel in June 2020. His videos show him playing Pro Evolution Soccer, the car racing game Blur and the first-person shooting game Counter-Strike.\nLong captions give details of the games, the companies that made them and the dates of their release.\nIn a video of Awni with an uncle, the pair promise a \"special\" range of content on the channel, declaring in unison: \"It will be a blast.\"\nThey grin and gesticulate as they take it in turns to talk. They say they plan to expand the channel to include vlogs and interviews.\nAshraf Eldous, a distant relative of Awni who works as a programmer and helps run several YouTube channels, says the teenager would frequently contact him asking for advice.\nIn messages from August 2022, shared with the BBC, Awni addresses \"brother Ashraf\" as he asks for YouTube tips. He would even take his father's phone in secret to ask for advice, Ashraf recalls.\nAshraf says the last time he spoke to Awni's father, he was told: \"Take care of Awni. Answer his questions. He's ambitious.\"\n\"His ambition was to be my competitor or colleague,\" Ashraf says. \"He created a YouTube channel. It wasn't that big, it didn't have any big views. Every start-up is hard at the beginning.\"\nBut after Awni's death in October, the views mounted when his fledgling channel caught the attention of established YouTubers, including Kuwaiti gamer AboFlah.\nIn an emotional video now viewed almost nine million times, AboFlah cries and walks away from the camera.\nHe has just discovered messages Awni had sent him on social media.\nOne of those message says: \"Nothing compares to Palestine's winter in Gaza; the atmosphere is legendary. We're drinking sahlab [a sweetened milk drink]. It's so good. We're also eating roasted chestnuts. I hope you come to Palestine. Much love.\"\nIn another, Awni writes to AboFlah: \"You're a legend and a role model.\"\nIn the video, as AboFlah weeps, he says: \"It's such a shame for this child to die… This child is one of many others who are even younger than him. If God wills it, they'll be birds of paradise.\"\n\"What you see is from the heart. I could not stop my tears,\" AboFlah tells the BBC, reflecting on the video he uploaded in October.\n\"It was very touching to hear that he looked up to me as a role model.\"\nAsked why he thinks Awni has made such a big impact, AboFlah says: \"Fans see themselves in Awni. We are all Awni.\"\nThe teenager's entire family - his four brothers and sisters and mother and father - were killed alongside him. But his surviving relatives say they are proud of the fame he has found after death.\n\"It's a gift from God that so many people around the world love Awni,\" says Ala'a.\n\"He used to talk about it enthusiastically, about his channel. He is more happy in heaven now.\"\nAdditional reporting by Muath Al Khatib"}

There were no casualties.\nIran has not commented. There has recently been a series of drone and rocket attacks on ships in the Red Sea by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.\nIn a separate development, the US Central Command (CENTCOM) said that on Saturday \"two Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles were fired into international shipping lanes in the Southern Red Sea from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. No ships reported being impacted by the ballistic missiles\".\nIt also said the USS Laboon warship patrolling the area \"shot down four unmanned aerial drones originating from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen that were inbound\" to the American vessel.\nLater that day, a crude oil tanker reported being hit by a Houthi drone in the southern Red Sea, while another tanker saw a near miss.\nThe rebels, who control, much of Yemen, claim to be targeting Israel-linked vessels over the continuing war in Gaza.\nMany large global shipping groups have suspended operations in the Red Sea due to the increased risk of attacks.\nIn a statement, the Pentagon said that Chem Pluto was hit by \"a one-way attack drone fired from Iran\".\nIt said it was \"a Liberia-flagged, Japanese-owned, and Netherlands-operated chemical tanker\".\nEarlier, maritime security firm Ambrey said the vessel was linked to Israel, and was heading from Saudi Arabia to India.\nThe incident took place 200 nautical miles south-west of the city of Veraval in India's Gujarat state, according to United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO).\nThe hit caused structural damage to the tanker and water was taken onboard.\nAmbrey said the event, which is the first of its kind so far away from the Red Sea, fell within an area the firm considered a \"heightened threat area\" for Iranian drones.\nThe Indian navy sent an aircraft and warships to offer assistance.\nEarlier on Saturday, the US accused Iran of being \"deeply involved\" in planning operations against commercial vessels in the Red Sea.\nNational security spokesperson Adrienne Watson said it was \"consistent with Iran's long-term material support and encouragement of the Houthis' destabilising actions in the region\".\nLater, an Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander warned it would force the closure of waterways other than the Red Sea if \"America and its allies continue committing crimes\" in Gaza.\nBrig Gen Mohammad Reza Naqdi said these could include the Mediterranean Sea and Strait of Gibraltar - but offered no details of how this would happen."}

This is a crucial test of the Biden administration, and whether it succeeds could help determine the next phase of the war - as well as the president's own political fortunes back home.\nIn public, the American effort to shape and restrain Israel's war has taken the form of advice rather than pressure.\nUS officials - from Mr Biden to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin - have continually affirmed what they present as Israel's right to self-defence, and declared that a military operation which stops short of removing Hamas from power would only guarantee more attacks.\nAs the conflict wore on, they've also become more outspoken about the need to protect civilians, warning that not doing so would land Israel with a \"strategic defeat\".\nMuch of the world sees this approach as failing to temper a relentless bombing campaign that ranks among the most deadly and destructive this century.\nUS officials insist their strategy has been the most effective way for the administration to influence an Israel traumatised by the unprecedented Hamas attack and disinclined to hold back.\nYet American policy since that day has fractured Joe Biden's Democratic Party, lost him crucial support among young and Arab Americans and left the US looking isolated on the world stage.\nSo far, President Biden's approach has achieved tangible, if limited, results.\nPersistent and painstaking diplomacy cleared a path to allowing some humanitarian aid into Gaza early on in the war, and helped broker a seven-day ceasefire to encourage hostage releases and the delivery of more assistance to desperate civilians.\nThe Americans have certainly been very hands on. A steady stream of senior officials to the region has meant there's been someone in the room much of the time, having the difficult conversations face to face.\n\"These trips are important because we have constant issues that we're dealing with together with the Israelis,\" said a US official.\nEach of Mr Blinken's three visits to the region has been a whirlwind of activity and he's been keen to highlight continued American efforts to free the hostages, increase humanitarian aid and ensure the conflict does not expand to consume the entire Middle East.\nProgress on protecting civilians has been hard to see. This week the death toll in Gaza reached 20,000, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. The Hamas raid on southern Israel on 7 October killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw about 240 taken hostage.\nDespite winning assurances that Israel would take steps to do so, Mr Blinken has spoken about the \"gap\" between the intent and the results.\nSo January will be a crucial test of whether the administration can convince Israel to alter the dynamic of the war. It's pushing the Israelis to \"de-intensify\" military operations in Gaza and transition to more targeted tactics that produce fewer civilian casualties than the bombing-and artillery-driven campaign.\nIt is a request that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not publicly endorsed, although his defence minister has talked about the war moving into different phases.\nCritics of the American strategy say the US has been so cautious that it is effectively complicit in Israel's war. They say it should have more forcefully called for Israel to curtail a disproportionate military campaign and used the threat to withhold or set conditions on massive amounts of American military aid to rein in Israeli excess.\nBut Aaron David Miller, who worked as a Middle East adviser in the State Department for some 25 years, calls the notion that the US could pressure Israel to change its policy in this case \"magical thinking.\"\n\"The battlefield dynamic is beyond our capacity to control, let alone micromanage,\" he says, noting that Israel and Hamas are pursuing irreconcilable goals.\nMr Miller, who is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Institute for International Peace, says history shows that Israel has responded to rare occasions of US pressure only when American demands are tethered to a result they can accept.\n\"Pressing the Israelis on a matter of critical importance to them without offering a compelling alternative or an outcome that they can rationalise and justify, never works,\" he says.\nIt's unclear if the \"bear hug\" strategy of publicly supporting Israel while preaching restraint behind closed doors will be enough to pull the Israelis across the line when it comes to scaling back the military campaign.\nIn the meantime the Americans are contending with growing international isolation.\nNowhere is this more evident than at the United Nations, where the US has opposed overwhelming demands for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.\nThis week, with the UN warning of famine in Gaza, the US allowed the passage of a second Security Council resolution calling for more humanitarian access to Gaza. It did so after negotiating intensely to change language on the suspension of hostilities and mechanisms to monitor and speed up aid delivery.\nThe administration wants no suggestion of a ceasefire that would constrain Israel's ability to destroy Hamas's leadership and military capability.\nBut even some allies have been outspoken about this approach.\n\"The United States is losing respect, it's losing credibility as a powerful nation,\" former Irish President Mary Robinson, speaking on behalf of a group of global leaders known as The Elders, said in a recent interview on RTE News. \"The United States has called for restraint, but [the Israeli government] isn't listening.\"\nAnd Arab partners of the US are alarmed by the radicalising effect of Israel's destruction in Gaza.\n\"Israel is jeopardising the standing of the United States and other Western friends of ours in our region,\" said Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi on a recent trip to Washington.\n\"It is not just killing Palestinians... it is also creating an environment in the region where the amount of hatred that's growing by the day, as a result of what we see unfolding in Gaza, is undoing 30 years of work that we all have invested in to normalise the idea of peace.\"\nMr Blinken has stressed that the regional and international community should also be pressing Hamas to lay down its arms and stop \"hiding behind civilians\".\nBut in comments at a fundraising event last week, President Biden appeared to acknowledge some of the administration's internal frustrations.\n\"(Israel) has most of the world supporting it,\" the president said. \"But they're starting to lose that support by the indiscriminate bombing that takes place.\"\nMr Biden is also facing growing domestic pressure to take a stronger line against Israel. In a New York Times public opinion survey this week, only 33% of registered American voters approved of the president's handling of the Israel-Palestinian conflict. A plurality, 44% to 39%, said Israel should end its military campaign.\nHeading into the 2024 presidential election year, the poll suggests the Biden administration is haemorrhaging support from key members of its electoral coalition. Among voters under 30, 46% said they sympathise more with the Palestinian side. Only 27% sided with the Israelis.\nSome prominent liberal members of the Democratic Party have pushed a resolution calling for a human rights report on Israel's use of American weapons that could potentially suspend US security assistance.\nVermont Senator Bernie Sanders, a left-wing independent who's an important ally of Joe Biden's, is sponsoring the resolution and has called Israeli conduct during the war \"reckless and immoral\".\nSeparately, a group of House Democrats with national security backgrounds has written to the White House arguing that Mr Netanyahu's military strategy is not in the interests of either Israel or the US.\nAnd there've been various expressions of dissent from within Mr Biden's own administration. More than 800 staff members have supported a letter calling for an immediate ceasefire, although most have done so anonymously, and only one has resigned.\n\"I felt a lot of dissonance between coming into work every single day and serving this administration that I had previously so proudly done, and then feeling this sort of vacuum where the influence of a call to a ceasefire (would be) massive coming from the US president and our boss,\" one staffer told the BBC.\nSuch sentiment underscores the difficult bind the US president finds himself in. Many world leaders, a significant number of administration insiders and about half the American public are increasingly unhappy with the current US strategy.\nBut if the president starts to get tougher with the Israelis, the other half of Americans that back Israel would almost certainly object - and there's still no guarantee that his current critics would be satisfied.\nScaling down the Israeli offensive is key. If it doesn't happen fast enough Mr Biden will have to seriously consider his next step.\nEspecially as the calendar will soon flip to 2024 - the last year of his first presidential term. Domestic politics, always a factor in US foreign policy, will increasingly become a pressing concern for the president.\nFor a man who promised a steady hand at the tiller after four years of Donald Trump's sometimes tumultuous foreign policy, the Gaza War has proven to be a formidable - and potentially grave - challenge to his political fortunes."}

This is a crucial test of the Biden administration, and whether it succeeds could help determine the next phase of the war - as well as the president's own political fortunes back home.\nIn public, the American effort to shape and restrain Israel's war has taken the form of advice rather than pressure.\nUS officials - from Mr Biden to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin - have continually affirmed what they present as Israel's right to self-defence, and declared that a military operation which stops short of removing Hamas from power would only guarantee more attacks.\nAs the conflict wore on, they've also become more outspoken about the need to protect civilians, warning that not doing so would land Israel with a \"strategic defeat\".\nMuch of the world sees this approach as failing to temper a relentless bombing campaign that ranks among the most deadly and destructive this century.\nUS officials insist their strategy has been the most effective way for the administration to influence an Israel traumatised by the unprecedented Hamas attack and disinclined to hold back.\nYet American policy since that day has fractured Joe Biden's Democratic Party, lost him crucial support among young and Arab Americans and left the US looking isolated on the world stage.\nSo far, President Biden's approach has achieved tangible, if limited, results.\nPersistent and painstaking diplomacy cleared a path to allowing some humanitarian aid into Gaza early on in the war, and helped broker a seven-day ceasefire to encourage hostage releases and the delivery of more assistance to desperate civilians.\nThe Americans have certainly been very hands on. A steady stream of senior officials to the region has meant there's been someone in the room much of the time, having the difficult conversations face to face.\n\"These trips are important because we have constant issues that we're dealing with together with the Israelis,\" said a US official.\nEach of Mr Blinken's three visits to the region has been a whirlwind of activity and he's been keen to highlight continued American efforts to free the hostages, increase humanitarian aid and ensure the conflict does not expand to consume the entire Middle East.\nProgress on protecting civilians has been hard to see. This week the death toll in Gaza reached 20,000, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. The Hamas raid on southern Israel on 7 October killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw about 240 taken hostage.\nDespite winning assurances that Israel would take steps to do so, Mr Blinken has spoken about the \"gap\" between the intent and the results.\nSo January will be a crucial test of whether the administration can convince Israel to alter the dynamic of the war.

She had previously expected a Christmas due date.\nA UAB obstetrician confirmed that the trio were doing well, and told the BBC it was the sort of case that most people in her profession \"go through their entire careers and never see\".\nMs Hatcher was told at age 17 she had a double uterus (uterus didelphys) - which the UAB described as a rare congenital anomaly affecting 0.3% of women.\nAnd the odds of becoming pregnant in both uteri - a dicavitary pregnancy - were even slimmer, at \"one in a million\", according to the UAB.\nReported cases worldwide are extremely rare. In 2019, a doctor in Bangladesh told the BBC a woman had given birth to twins almost a month after delivering a premature baby in her other uterus.\nMs Hatcher had three previous, healthy pregnancies. This time, she believed herself to be pregnant in only one uterus - until a routine ultrasound revealed there was also a baby in her second. \n\"I gasped... We just could not believe it,\" she recalled.\nShe went on to document her unusual journey on Instagram. One update at 38 weeks asked: \"What the heck?! HOW have we made it this far?!\" \nThe UAB described her pregnancy as routine. Prof Richard Davis, who co-managed the delivery, pointed out that each baby had enjoyed \"extra space to grow and develop\".\nThis was because each baby had a womb to itself, he said - unlike in a typical twin pregnancy.\nMs Hatcher's labour was induced at 39 weeks, and required double the monitoring and charting at the hospital - as well as double the staffing.\nThis proved to be \"the most atypical\" part of Ms Hatcher's case, said Dr Shweta Patel from the hospital's obstetrics and gynaecology team.\nUAB staff did not have \"a lot of evidence or data\" to hand, Dr Patel told the BBC, and were required to apply their knowledge of typical pregnancies.\nSure enough, the babies had a \"mind of their own\", she said - and were delivered by different methods.\nThe first, Roxi, was born vaginally at about 19:45 local time on 19 December. The second, named Rebel, came by C-section more than 10 hours later. \nProf Davis said the girls could be called fraternal twins - a term used when each baby develops from a separate egg, each fertilised by a separate sperm.\n\"At the end of the day, it was two babies in one belly at the same time,\" he said. \"They just had different apartments.\""}

Any minus can always be turned into a plus. Any experience is still an experience,\" she told Ms Duntsova, 40, after the decision.\nThe former TV journalist had declared she would run for the presidency in November. At the time, she told the Reuters news agency: \"Any sane person taking this step would be afraid - but fear must not win.\"\nRussia's constitution was amended in 2020, increasing the presidential term from four to six years and giving Mr Putin a clean slate to run again by cancelling out his previous terms.\nMoscow has sidelined opposition figures for years, and President Putin is expected to win in March; the Kremlin claims he enjoys genuine support among Russians.\nMs Duntsova had been vocal on her plans to run a campaign on ending the war in Ukraine and freeing political prisoners.\nShe was quick to respond after the commission's decision. \"We will appeal to the Supreme Court, since this decision is not based on the law,\" a message on her Telegram channel said.\nThe commission said 29 people have so far filed to run for the presidency. But after today's decision, Mr Putin remains the only candidate to be able to register as a candidate.\nIn November, a nationalist pro-war blogger who had fiercely criticised Russia's military strategy in Ukraine, said he wanted to challenge Putin and disrupt the \"sham\" poll.\nIgor Girkin, 52, was detained in July following a series of social media posts critical of the president. He is now in jail awaiting trial for extremism, which he denies.\nMr Putin recently showed a rare example of caving in to popular pressure - by cutting the cost of buying chicken and eggs. On a public phone-in, a caller berated the Russian president for the high price she was having to pay.\nWith just three months to go until the election, President Putin has now decided that eggs and chicken should be exempt from all import taxes."}

Islamic Jihad, a smaller group in the Gaza Strip, is among those known to also be holding Israeli hostages.\nThe Hamas statement puts the Israeli government in a very difficult position.\nIt has said it thinks the best way to get the release of hostages is military pressure on Hamas and by staging rescue operations.\nBut so far that approach has not really worked. Only one hostage - Ori Megidish - has actually been rescued.\nThe government is also under huge pressure from the relatives of the hostages still being held, with some telling it the strategy of force is not working.\nHamas is putting pressure on Israel to stop the war altogether but without any guarantee that the group is going to stop its armed actions.\nSo the Israeli government is extremely reluctant to stop fighting until it feels it has completely degraded Hamas capability and it has not done that yet.\nThis will be a huge disappointment for the people of Gaza, who are desperate for this war to stop.\nEarly on Friday, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry put the overall death toll there since 7 October at 20,057, including at least 8,000 children and 6,200 women.\nWhen Hamas and their allies broke through the heavily guarded perimeter with Israel on 7 October they killed 1,200 people."}

On Wednesday a convoy carrying aid from Jordan crossed into Gaza via Israel for the first time since the start of the war.\nHowaida Al-Daramali, a Palestinian woman who has been displaced to Khan Younis and who is also helping find shelter for other displaced families, said the limited aid being delivered \"only goes to one or two places\" and most people in Gaza were not receiving anything.\n\"We want this aid to be accompanied by teams who will be responsible for distributing it especially since the situation here is very difficult. Many people broke into the Red Crescent warehouses and looted them,\" she told the BBC.\nMeanwhile some families who were getting aid because they were in UN-run shelters were selling what they did not need at inflated prices, Ms al-Daramali said.\n\"Even with cash, there are no goods in the supermarket and no suppliers. We can buy only from people who receive aid and sell it at the school gates, which are dangerous places for us to reach,\" she said.\nPeople in Khan Younis were \"psychologically and economically devastated\", she said.\nThe UN Security Council is meanwhile trying to agree on a vote calling for more aid to get into Gaza. The vote has been delayed for several days over the wording of the text.\nThe US has expressed support for the latest draft resolution after earlier voicing \"widespread concerns\" with an earlier version that called for a ceasefire - something the US is against, saying it would only benefit Hamas.\nThe new draft aims to create a mechanism to accelerate aid but makes clear it would involve relevant parties such as Israel.\nIt also calls for all available routes to be used for deliveries but does not seek an immediate end to the fighting.\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, US Ambassador to the UN, described it as a \"very strong resolution that is fully supported by the Arab group\".\nMeanwhile, the fighting in and around Gaza continues. Hamas authorities on Thursday accused Israel of attacking the Rafah crossing - killing four people, including the director of the recently reopened Kerem Shalom crossing. Israel's military has not commented on the reported incident.\nTalks had been taking place in Egypt to reach a new truce - similar to the week-long pause in fighting last month that saw hostages released.\nBut on Thursday they suffered a setback when Hamas said it would not agree to a release of some hostages in exchange for a partial ceasefire.\nIt said Palestinian groups had rejected the prospect of more hostages being released until Israel agrees to end the war. Israel has repeatedly rejected a permanent ceasefire with Hamas, saying it aims to destroy the group.\nMore than 240 Israeli hostages were captured on 7 October when Hamas broke through the fortified perimeter with Israel, killing 1,200 people. A total of 110 hostages were released in the truce last month.\nEarlier this week, Hamas said the number of people killed in Gaza in 10 weeks of fighting had passed 20,000."}

After a backlash, the paper removed the article from its website, saying on X (formerly Twitter) that the report \"was based on faulty sourcing\".\nA few weeks earlier, a video of Israeli siblings Rotem Mathias, 16, and his two sisters, Shakked and Shir, went viral online. Rotem witnessed his parents get killed by Hamas gunmen on 7 October as they sheltered in their house in a kibbutz near the border with Gaza.\nThe viral video featured edited clips from the siblings' interviews with US outlets ABC and CNN days after the attack. It falsely claimed that they were \"crisis actors\" who were lying about their parents' deaths and struggling to hold their laughter in front of cameras.\nThese are just two examples - viewed millions of times each - showcasing the social media schism in the Israel-Gaza war that has brought denial of atrocities and human suffering to the forefront of online debate about the conflict.\nOne of the key terms used to deny or minimise human suffering in Gaza is \"Pallywood\", a disparaging combination of \"Palestine\" and \"Hollywood\". Its proponents claim fake or staged footage of Palestinian \"crisis actors\" posing as genuine civilian casualties is regularly shared online to influence public opinion and deceive global media.\nA BBC Verify analysis suggests that on X alone, the term \"Pallywood\" has seen the largest spike in the number of mentions in the past 10 years.\nDuring previous flare-ups of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in 2014, 2018 and 2021 the word \"Pallywood\" consistently peaked at either 9,500 or 13,000 mentions in a single month on X. After the 7 October Hamas attack, the number of mentions peaked at 220,000 in November.\nBBC Verify found that among those sharing the term \"Pallywood\" on social media in the past months, including X, Facebook and Instagram, were Israeli officials, celebrities and popular bloggers from Israel and the US.\nOn the other hand, while supporters of the Palestinians do not have a single term used to deny atrocities committed by Hamas on 7 October in Israel, posts making such claims routinely get millions of views on social media. Some falsely say that Hamas did not kill civilians on that day, or that the scale of civilian casualties has been massively exaggerated. Some even go further, falsely claiming that most of the victims were actually killed by the Israel Defense Forces, not Hamas.\nExperts specialising in reconciliation efforts worry that viral disinformation which denies the other side's suffering can be dehumanising, and may impact the longer-term prospects of mending the relations between the communities affected.\n\"The biggest risks, I think, are the erosion of trust and the erosion of empathy,\" said Harriet Vickers, programme lead at the Tim Parry and Johnathan Ball Foundation for Peace, a charity that supports victims of conflict, political violence and acts of terror.\n\"It undermines the ability to even begin approaching reconciliation efforts.\"\nShe added that false narratives and dehumanising rhetoric can also \"have a profound effect beyond those that are directly impacted by violence, and can actually further the hurt that is being done to those individuals\".\nFalse narratives about \"crisis actors\" or atrocity denial are not new to those who study disinformation.\nThe concept of \"crisis actors\" in particular - that is people who pretend or are paid to act out some particular tragedy or disaster - has been popular among promoters of conspiracy theories for years.\nIt was notoriously used to allege that parents of dead children in the Sandy Hook school shooting in the US were somehow faking their personal tragedies.\nIn the past few years similar viral claims were posted about the killing of Ukrainian civilians in Bucha, and victims of the war in Syria.\nBut the volume of dehumanising rhetoric posted during this war has surprised even those who deal with such content on a daily basis.\nEliot Higgins, the founder of the investigative website Bellingcat that has covered the wars in Syria and Ukraine in recent years, says the volume of disinformation in the current Israeli-Gaza war is \"unique to this conflict\".\n\"I've seen the kind of same intensity of toxicity and vile responses and disinformation, the way they treat women and children and that kind of stuff, with Syria, with Ukraine and so many different topics - just there are more people doing it,\" he told the BBC.\nMr Higgins added that because many people have had very strong opinions about either side of the conflict for years, \"there are more people who are sharing stuff because it is resonating with them emotionally\".\n\"They don't really care if it's true or not, it just feels true to them.\"\nBack in November, a video showing makeup and fake blood being applied to a child actor's face was posted on X by Ofir Gendelman, the Israeli prime minister's spokesperson to the Arab world.\n\"See for yourselves how they fake injuries and evacuating 'injured' civilians, all in front of the cameras. Pallywood gets busted again,\" Mr Gendelman said in a post that was viewed millions of times before being deleted.\nThe video was, in fact, behind-the-scenes footage from a 45-second Lebanese film made in tribute to Gazans and posted online in October.\nDirector Mahmoud Ramzi, who took to Instagram to personally debunk the false claim made about his film, told the BBC that in the end, the misinformation might have backfired, with the controversy helping his film reach a much bigger audience.\nThe BBC approached Mr Gendelman for comment but he has not responded.\nOthers have expressed concern for the real people who find themselves in the middle of online disinformation wars. James Longman, the ABC correspondent who interviewed Rotem and his sisters, says watching Rotem recount the death of his parents brought him and his cameraman to tears.\n\"He was in tears, his sister was in tears, their grandfather, who was with us. Our cameraman, the hospital porters, the nurses, the doctors, and I was in tears. I mean all of us sitting there listening to what he had to say,\" he told the BBC.\n\"It was extraordinary to hear him say it, to watch his reactions as he explained what had happened.\"\nMr Longman said he was shocked when he saw false claims about the siblings being shared online and took to X to debunk it. His post was shared widely, and led to at least one of the viral messages about the siblings being subsequently deleted by the person who posted it.\n\"But it doesn't make it any less horrible for Rotem's family,\" Mr Longman said."}

The BBC Arabic cameraman shares a vivid and shocking account of what he, his wife and children experienced as they headed south.\nWarning: This story contains graphic descriptions which may be distressing\nWe left in such a hurry. We were in the middle of baking some bread and realised the houses opposite us were being bombed, one by one. I knew it would soon be our turn. We had packed some bags in case this happened but everything was so rushed we forgot to take them. We didn't even shut the front door.\nWe had waited to leave because we didn't want to move my elderly parents and we had taken years to save up to build our house in al-Zeitoun, but in the end we had to go. My baby son, Omar, died there in November 2012, killed when shrapnel hit our house in another war with Israel and I couldn't risk losing any more children.\nI knew that in the south there was no electricity, no water and people had to queue for hours to use a toilet. But in the end, grabbing just a bottle of water and some leftover bread, we joined thousands of others making the dangerous journey down the Salah al-Din road to the south, where Israel said it was safe.\nLots of my family walked together - my wife Ahlam, our four sons, who are two, eight, nine and 14 years old, my parents, brothers, sisters, cousins and their children.\nWe walked for hours and knew that eventually we would have to go through an Israeli checkpoint that was set up during the war. We were nervous and my children kept asking: \"What will the army do to us?\"\nWe came to a stop about two-thirds of a mile (1km) from the checkpoint and joined a huge queue of people that filled the entire road. We spent more than four hours waiting there and my father fainted three times.\nThere were Israeli soldiers watching us from bombed-out buildings on one side of the road and more on an empty plot of land on the other side.\nAs we edged closer to the checkpoint we saw more soldiers above us in a tent on a hill. We think they managed the checkpoint remotely from there, watching us through binoculars and using loudspeakers to tell us what to do.\nThere were two open-sided shipping containers near the tent. All the men had to pass through one and the women through the other, with cameras constantly trained on us. When we had gone through, Israeli soldiers asked to see our IDs and we were photographed.\nIt was like judgement day.\nI saw about 50 people detained, all men, including two of my neighbours. One young man was stopped because he had lost his documents and couldn't remember his ID number. Another man next to me in the queue was called a terrorist by an Israeli soldier, before he too was taken away.\nThey were told to strip down to their underwear and sit on the ground. Some were later asked to get dressed and leave, while others were blindfolded.\nI saw four blindfolded detainees, including my neighbours, taken behind a sand hill by a demolished building. When they were out of sight, we heard gunfire. I have no idea whether they were shot or not.\nSeparately, other people who made the same journey as me were contacted by a colleague of mine in Cairo. One of them, Kamal Aljojo, said that just after he went through the checkpoint a week earlier, he had seen dead bodies, but he didn't know how they had died.\nMy colleague also spoke to a man called Muhammed who went through the same checkpoint on 13 November. \"A soldier asked me to strip off all of my clothes, even my underwear,\" Muhammed told the BBC. He added: \"I was naked in front of everyone walking past. I felt ashamed. Suddenly a female soldier pointed her gun at me and laughed before quickly moving it away. I was humiliated.\" Muhammed said he had to wait naked for about two hours before he was allowed to go.\nAlthough my wife, children, parents and I all got through the checkpoint safely, two of my brothers were delayed.\nWhile we were waiting for them, an Israeli soldier shouted at a group of people in front of us who were trying to go back towards the containers to check on their relatives, who had been held up.\nHe used a loudspeaker to tell them to move on and to stay at least 300yds (300m) away, then a soldier started shooting in the air in their direction to intimidate them. We had heard a lot of gunshots while we were queueing.\nEveryone was crying and my mother was sobbing: \"What happened to my sons? Did they shoot them?\"\nAfter well over an hour my brothers finally appeared.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that \"individuals suspected of affiliations with terrorist organisations\" were detained for preliminary inquiries, and if they remained suspects they were transferred to Israel for further questioning. Others were \"promptly released\", it said.\nIt said clothes had to be removed to check for explosive vests or other weapons and detainees were clothed as soon possible. It said it did not aim to \"undermine the security and dignity of the detainees\" and that the IDF \"operates in accordance with international law\".\nThe IDF also said it \"does not shoot at civilians moving along the humanitarian corridor from the north to the south\", but when young men tried to move in the opposite direction they \"were met with shots for the purposes of dispersal, after they were told with a loudspeaker not to advance towards the position of the troops and continued to do so\".\nIt added that the sound of shooting was common and \"the sound of gunfire alone does not constitute an indication of shooting from a specific place or of a certain type\".\nMy wife and I felt relieved as we moved on and the checkpoint disappeared from sight behind us, but we had no idea that the hardest part of the journey was yet to come.\nAs we walked further south, I saw about 10 bodies in different places by the roadside.\nOther scattered, rotting body parts, were covered in flies with birds pecking at the remains. They gave off one of the foulest smells I have ever experienced.\nI couldn't bear the thought of my children seeing them so I screamed at the top of my lungs, telling them to look at the sky and keep walking.\nI saw a burned-out car with a severed human head inside. The hands of the headless rotting corpse were still holding the steering wheel.\nThere were also bodies of dead donkeys and horses, some reduced to skeletons, and huge piles of rubbish and spoiled food.\nThen an Israeli tank appeared on a side road, moving towards us at breakneck speed. We were frightened and in order to get away, we had to run over corpses. Some people in the crowd tripped on the bodies. The tank changed course about 20yds (20m) before it reached the main road.\nSuddenly, next to the road, a building was bombed. The explosion was terrifying and shrapnel flew everywhere.\nI wanted the world to swallow us up.\nWe were shaken and exhausted but carried on towards Nuseirat camp. We arrived there in the evening and had to sleep on the pavement. It was freezing.\nWe put my jacket around our middle sons, tucking their hands into the sleeves to try to keep them warm. We covered our youngest with my shirt. I have never been so cold in all my life.\nWhen the BBC asked about the tank and the bodies, the IDF said that \"during the day, tanks move on routes that intersect with the Salah al-Din road, but there was no case in which tanks moved towards civilians moving from north to south of the Gaza Strip on the humanitarian corridor\".\nThe IDF said it did not know of any cases of piles of corpses on the Salah al-Din road but there were times when Gazan vehicles \"abandoned bodies during the journey, which the IDF subsequently evacuated\".\nThe next morning we set off early for Khan Younis, Gaza's second largest city. We paid someone to take us part of the way in a cart pulled by a donkey. Then at Deir al-Balah, we got on a bus that was only meant to carry 20 people, but 30 people got on board. Some sat on the roof and others clung to the doors and windows from the outside.\nIn Khan Younis, we tried to find a safe place to stay at a UN-run school that had been turned into a shelter, but it was full. We ended up renting a warehouse under a residential building instead and stayed there for a week.\nMy parents, brother and sisters decided to stay in Khan Younis, but after the local market was bombed, my wife and I decided to take our children further south to Rafah to be with her family. They managed to get a lift in a car and I joined them later by bus, but it was so full I had to hang on to the outside of the door.\nWe are now renting a small outhouse with a roof made of tin and plastic. There is nothing to protect us from falling shrapnel.\nEverything is expensive and we can't get many of the things we need. If we want drinking water, we have to queue for three hours and we don't have enough food for three meals a day, so we don't eat lunch any more, only breakfast and dinner.\nMy son used to have an egg every day. An egg - can you imagine? I can't even give him that now. All I want to do is leave Gaza and be safe with my children, even if that means living in a tent.\nAdditional reporting by BBC News Arabic's Abdelrahman Abutaleb in Cairo."}

But as they prepare for Christmas, many here are still living with the damage and shock of the attack.\nThe Christmas carol procession lurches its way through Jaranwala's back streets, gathering singers as we go. \nWe start at the church, the pastor, two drummers, 15 or so enthusiastic singers, lighting the way through the dark streets with phone torches. With each turn more come to their doors to join. \nChildren are dressed in their Christmas best, some belting out their favourite carol lines. Others shyly join in, dressed in sparkly dresses with glittery bows, Father Christmas hats and light-up trainers, stomping through the streets. Some of the older boys throw small firecrackers, giggling as their mothers shout at them for making them jump.  \nChristmas traditions in Jaranwala have a renewed importance to Pastor Rizwan Mill this year. \n\"Christmas now is in all our hearts,\" he says, taking a small break from leading the congregation. \"Christ is a saviour for me. He saved me during the hours of the attack. He is all our saviour.\" \nOn 16 August, thousands gathered in Jaranwala, angry at allegations that someone from the Christian community had deliberately damaged pages from the holy Quran. People were being accused of blasphemy. \nThe crowd turned violent, attacking churches and private homes. Many from the Christian community fled, spending the night in open fields, fearful of returning to the city. While nine police officers were injured, no civilian lives were lost. \nThe police promised justice, arresting more than 350 people, while the government promised to help rebuild both trust and the buildings. \nThe authorities have said that all 22 churches that were attacked have now been renovated and reopened - the walls are still crisp with fresh paint and the floors have that new carpet smell. \nAlongside money from the government, there have been works and donations by charities, NGOs and outreach programmes between local mosques and churches. \nBut four months later, some homes still show the scars of that night.\nWe find Saima sitting in the one room of her home still intact, surrounded by blackened walls. The money has been paid, she says, but once divided amongst all the relatives who live in the building, it wasn't enough. The damage was extensive and the repair work is taking time. \n\"This was a very beautiful house,\" she tells me. \n\"My parents built it, they saved every penny for it. It takes a whole lifetime to build a house. And now it's all burnt. Whatever we had, it's all burnt.\"\nShe says the whole household - including her, her siblings and their children, four families in total - were given two million rupees, around $7,100 (£5,586).  \nSome of that money has gone on rent for those who can't stay in the house. Now it is just Saima and one sister-in-law that live in the only habitable room. \n\"We are so tired,\" she tells me quietly. She begins to cry. \"In this one room, there is no facility, there is no light, no water, we don't have anything. We just want this house to be rebuilt.\"\nThe authorities in Jaranwala told the BBC that 78 households were identified by a damage assessment committee and given two million rupees each. The amount, they stated, was decided after examining the damage of each house.  \nAcross the road, work is still underway at Sonam's house. \nWhen we visited in August, one bedroom was still smouldering, another had a broken window. The bed had been thrown from the first floor to the street. \nNow the rooms are repainted, with new furniture - although the bedroom door still has blunt holes, hacked into the wood by rioters. The memories too are still close to the surface. \n\"We don't feel safe here,\" Sonam says. \n\"The fear that entered our hearts is still there. Any shouting in the street, everyone goes out to see what is happening because we are so scared. It's very hard to trust again.\"\n\"As a society and as a police force we have to rebuild trust,\" says Captain Ali Zia, city police officer. \"Both have already done a lot to do that.\" \nBut there is still some lingering anger. \nAt the time of the attacks, some criticised the police for failing to stop the damage or step in before the crowd got of control. \n\"Our first priority was to save lives,\" says Captain Zia. \"The second was to save property. Nine of the police officials were injured that day; the police did take the brunt. By and large we do have people's trust.\" \nPolice say around a quarter of the 350 originally arrested are still in prison. The others are out on bail, but authorities are adamant cases will still be brought against them. \n\"There is a process of law,\" Captain Zia says. \"The police department and the government are two of the biggest stakeholders here. We want to show that this act won't be tolerated in the future. If we don't ensure justice, it will keep happening.\" \nCaptain Zia says he hopes the court cases will start early in 2024. Until then, the police are loath to be drawn on details of both the blasphemy case and the violent mob. But of the violence in the streets, police say there is no indication that the reaction was pre-planned and instead believe the call to protest was spontaneously spread through social media. \nIn Jaranwala, the carol procession finally winds its way back to the church where it began. \nThe children begin to show their carefully rehearsed Christmas dance routines, performing on a stage papered with pictures of snow men, Christmas trees and Father Christmas. \nIn August this was one of the churches still smouldering hours later. \n\"We still feel that moment,\" Saima tells me. \"But we hope that whatever has passed has passed. That is what we want. That is what we pray for.\" "}

Self-funding was my only option,\" Bazawule wrote on crowdfunding site Kickstarter, as he attempted to raise more money for post-production.\nThrough magical realism, The Burial of Kojo tells the story of a young girl on a mission to look for her father after he goes missing while working in a gold mine in Ghana. The film was shot in the country with a local cast, who speak Twi throughout most of the film.\nBazawule composed and performed the score for The Burial of Kojo, telling the BBC after the film's 2018 premiere: \"Making film is, I believe, the quintessential mix of all creative endeavours - you get to be a bit of a writer, you get to be a bit of a visual artist, you get to be a bit of a musician, all in one.\"\nDespite not possessing formal training or funding from traditional sources, Bazawule's debut film caught the eye of Hollywood titan Ava DuVernay, director of projects like Selma and When They See Us.\nAfter her company Array picked up The Burial of Kojo's distribution rights, it became the first Ghanaian-produced film to stream on Netflix.\nBazawule received widespread critical acclaim, with the New York Times praising \"a near-virtuoso work, a feast of emotion, nuance and beauty, and a startling feature directing debut\".\nAnd film critics were not the only ones who were impressed. According to Bazawule, it was after watching The Burial of Kojo on Netflix that Beyoncé invited him on board her own cinematic effort, Black Is King.\nReleased in 2020, it serves as a visual companion to Beyoncé's soundtrack for the 2019 Lion King reboot.\nThe film celebrates black identity and female empowerment, while showcasing talent and culture from across Africa.\nBazawule went on to bag a Grammy nomination for his work on the project.\nAfter entering the fields of film and music, Bazawule then crossed the frontier into literature.\nHis 2022 novel, The Scent of Burnt Flowers, follows a couple who seek asylum in Ghana after fleeing persecution in 1960s America.\nIt is reportedly being adapted into a six-episode TV series - with Bazawule writing, directing and producing.\nFor Bazawule, key to his take on Celie, the character at the centre of The Color Purple, is her fertile imagination - using that to show how she overcomes abuse and trauma.\n\"She's working in her head to liberate herself,\" he said in an interview in the run-up to the film's release.\nThe Color Purple is also said to have African musical influences thanks to Bazawule - and he remains inspired by stories from his birthplace despite not having lived there for decades.\nHe encourages other African creatives to bring their countries to the big screen, addressing filmmakers in his interview with the BBC.\n\"Look inward, look at what we have on the continent. Visually, it's unmatched. So know what you have, do the work and believe,\" he said.\nYou may be interested in:"}

It is a super little village.\"\nFor those who remember the movie, that certainly sounds more than a little bit like Bedford Falls."}

But on the day the babies were due, war broke out and the little girls were born to the sound of Russian shells falling around them.\nWhen Hanna went for her first ultrasound scan, it showed a small dot - the baby she and Andriy had planned for so long. But on their next visit to the doctor they were told they were expecting twins. The third visit revealed she was actually pregnant with triplets.\n\"We were afraid to see the doctor for the fourth appointment,\" Hanna jokes. But the couple were happy. \"We really wanted children. God had heard us and gave us three at once,\" she tells the Ukrainecast podcast.\nHanna went into a maternity hospital in Chernihiv on 23 February 2022 for a Caesarean section, which was scheduled for the next morning.\nRumours about a Russian invasion had been spreading for a while but she did not believe them until early on 24 February when she got a message from her brother, who was studying at a military school. He told her that the war had started and he did not know where he was going to be sent. He urged her to leave Chernihiv.\nBut she could not leave straight away. Her operation was planned for 09:00 and the hospital staff were preparing to deliver their first triplets in three years.\nHanna could not believe the war had begun: \"I thought it would happen somewhere far away, in a field, a forest, but not in our lives.\"\nAndriy arrived at the hospital at 06:00 carrying suitcases filled with clothes and other supplies and tried to calm her down. \"He said that the main thing was to bring our children into this world,\" Hanna recalls.\nThe babies were born just minutes apart: Emilia at 09:36, Olivia at 09:37 and at 09:38 it was Melania's turn. \"I couldn't imagine they would be so beautiful,\" says Hannah.\nTen minutes later, at 09:48, the Ukrainian state border service officially announced that Russian military vehicles had entered the Chernihiv region.\nChernihiv is in northern Ukraine on the border with Belarus - where Russian troops invaded from - and was immediately hit by shelling. Although Russia did not occupy the city, it was badly damaged.\nOn the evening after she gave birth, recovering from surgery and barely able to get out of bed, Hanna was told to go down to a bomb shelter with her babies. \"I was totally lost. I didn't understand how I would get there,\" she says.\nTo reach it, she had to go outside, where the temperature was close to zero. The nurses wrapped the babies in warm blankets and carried them for her.\nThere were about 100 people with newborns in the shelter and hospital staff delivered 20 babies down there, they later told Ukrainian media.\nAlthough Hanna's daughters were healthy, they were premature. Normally, they would have been put in a special incubator, but there wasn't one in the shelter, so the nurses took it in turns to cuddle them under their clothes to keep them warm.\n\"The girls were so defenceless. I was lying next to them and didn't know how to help them,\" Hanna says, her voice trembling.\nThey were tiny - Emilia and Melania weighed just 3.5lb and 3lb (1.6kg and 1.4kg), but Olivia was even smaller. She was 2.5lb (1.1kg) and she needed to be moved to the intensive care unit if she was going to survive.\nHanna and Andriy decided they couldn't send her there alone, so after a week in the bomb shelter the whole family moved up to the hospital's first floor.\nOlivia was in intensive care for about two weeks. \"We stayed in the hospital's corridor with the other two girls and only went down to the basement when there were massive explosions,\" says Hanna.\nAt one point, Hanna was sitting in a corridor with Emilia and Melania, when she suddenly saw a massive flash followed by pitch darkness and smoke.\n\"I jumped up and grabbed my children, not knowing whether I was dead or alive,\" she says.\nThen she saw Andriy running towards her and they rushed to the intensive care room to see if Olivia had been hurt.\nThey ran past shattered windows, blown-off doors and destroyed walls. But luckily Olivia's room had not been touched and she was safe.\nFinally, on 20 March the family left the hospital and with the help of volunteers were evacuated to Kyiv.\nThe journey, which would normally have taken two hours, took five as they had to take a roundabout route to avoid Russian troops.\nThey later spent a few months in Slovakia before returning to their hometown.\nAll that time, Hanna was desperate for her father Anatolii to meet his granddaughters. He was fighting in the Ukrainian army and his messages were a source of huge strength.\n\"He kept saying: 'Hold on, I'm protecting you, I'm defending you. We will fight the Russians off,'\" she recalls.\nAfter Russian forces withdrew from the Chernihiv region in April 2022, Anatolii was sent to eastern Ukraine.\nThe family hoped he would come home in time for the girls' first birthday, but he never made it. On 11 January 2023 he was killed on the front line near Terny village in Donetsk. He was 51 years old.\n\"I keep thinking that the war will end and he will come home from the battlefield,\" says Hanna with tears in her eyes. \"I can't believe that our whole family won't be together.\"\nShe and Andriy compare the first year of their babies' lives to \"a scary movie\", but they say that thanks to the girls, there has also been a lot of love and happiness - \"three times more\".\nListen to the full story on BBC Ukrainecast"}

They must submit applications to the justice department.\nThe Democratic president's action expands on an executive order from last year, when his administration pardoned thousands of people who were convicted under federal law of possessing small amounts of marijuana.\nTwenty-four states and Washington DC have decriminalised or legalised marijuana use in some or all circumstances. But it remains illegal at the federal level.\nEarlier this year, the Health and Human Services Administration recommended that the Drug Enforcement Administration loosen federal restrictions on marijuana.\nMr Biden's order does not cover individuals who have been convicted of state-level crimes, but he urged governors to take similar action.\nSarah Gersten, executive director and general counsel for the Last Prisoner Project, called the executive order \"largely symbolic\".\n\"As the president has acknowledged, the vast majority of people convicted of cannabis are at the state level,\" Ms Gersten said.\nShe added that while \"the number of people who have federal offences are very low, a pardon at the federal level doesn't effectuate the kind of record clearance we want to see\".\nThe order also did not cover other marijuana-related offences that carry prison time.\nIt would not pardon, for example, Stephanie Shepard, the director of advocacy for the Last Prisoners Project.\nShe was imprisoned for conspiracy to distribute marijuana several years ago. The sentence continues to affect her life, and she noted that individuals with criminal records may struggle to find housing or jobs because a conviction will appear on a background check.\n\"I really wish he [Mr Biden] would just sit down and talk to someone who has an incarcerated parent, that has grown up without their parent because they're incarcerated, but at the same time can now walk down the street and see multiple dispensaries selling the same plant that their parents did,\" she said.\nThe executive order, in Ms Shepard's view, was \"just not enough\"."}

I absolutely love my job,\" she said.\nDr Payne was working for the Care Quality Commission when she got chatting to another doctor who worked in the Orkney islands in Scotland.\n\"I was like, 'Wow, that sort of island job would be my dream but it would never be practical, I've got two kids and my husband works full-time.' And she said, 'No, no, no, hear me out, my job is amazing and we're recruiting.'\"\nDr Payne has now been working for NHS Orkney for four years, often flying between the archipelago's islands.\nShe is on a rota with seven other doctors who each spend one week in eight in Orkney.\nShe spends the rest of her time working from home in Cardiff as a researcher for Oxford University and occasionally working on other islands as a locum - a doctor used to temporarily fill shifts.\nWorking in remote settings brings with it some very particular challenges.\n\"Some of the small islands I work on you might be the only healthcare professional, so your job involves everything from managing emergencies, sorting out helicopters, managing asthma, collecting medication from the ferry, taking blood and taking it to the aeroplane for collection.\n\"It's whatever comes in through the door type of medicine... from a kid who's got a bead up their nose to somebody who's had a massive heart attack.\"\nPoor weather conditions mean getting on or off an island is not always straightforward.\nShe was once trapped on Eday, one of the islands of Orkney, over new year because a big storm meant her plane was cancelled.\nShe said something common to island communities was people not seeking help as soon as they should.\n\"Sometimes, particularly farmers, will try treating themselves that little bit longer than maybe they should and so people sometimes come in a lot more poorly than they might in other settings,\" she explained.\nDr Payne said the worst situation was somebody deteriorating in a storm and needing a helicopter retrieval.\n\"You'd get them into hospital sooner rather than later on an island setting... everything happens two steps sooner in order to avoid a really sick patient in a really remote location,\" she said.\nIn her four years in the job, Dr Payne has developed a real love for Orkney.\n\"It's just the most magical place you can imagine,\" she said.\n\"The light is amazing... it's got this kind of otherworldliness to it.\"\nShe added patients there really appreciated their doctors.\n\"They know it's not easy to get doctors there, particularly in bad weather and to work somewhere where people are just grateful is so rewarding,\" she said.\nWhen she works on Barra in the Outer Hebrides, an island chain off the west coast of mainland Scotland, her plane has to land on the beach - \"just one of the most incredible experiences of my life\".\nLast summer she fulfilled a dream to spend a month in the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic Ocean approximately 400 miles (650km) off South America.\nHer job involved covering the hospital, A&E and out of hours GP services - her two teenage children and husband were even able to join her for part of it.\nAbout 10 minutes away from the archipelago's only hospital - King Edward VII Hospital - Gentoo penguins can be seen on the beach.\nThe family were able to watch them come in from the sea on their bellies and waddle across the beaches fast as they could to avoid patrolling sealions.\n\"They were just the cutest,\" said Dr Payne.\n\"You wake up and think 'did it really happened?' Was I dreaming from the minute I turned up at Brize Norton to take an RAF flight?'.\"\nAbout 10% of the population of the Falkland Islands live on islands that cover an area about two-thirds of the size of Wales.\nShe described one particular shift when she was working as the flying doctor covering the islands as \"one of the best days of my entire life\".\nThere are no scheduled flights to the smaller islands so people email where they want to go or what they need to be transported and a timetable for the eight-seater Britten-Norman Islander aircraft is constructed around that.\nOn this particular shift she was sitting next to the pilot with a sheep shearer and noisy cat on the way back to being reunited with its owner, but the flight was also used to help a farmer find some missing cows from the air.\nAfter taking blood in the back of a 4x4, there were stops to drop off the cat and house calls to see three more patients.\nThe landing strip was muddy so instead they landed on the beach, doing a fly-over first to scare off any penguins.\n\"I was thinking, 'I cannot believe I could be sitting in a surgery somewhere or I could be wild and free and looking out for penguins on a beach after delivering healthcare to the remotest communities in the world',\" she said.\nOn another memorable day in the Falkland Islands the family drove across beaches and moors in a 4x4 to visit Volunteer Point to see penguins.\n\"There were penguins everywhere, there were king penguins sitting in little groups with all the babies in the middle and the adults around them keeping them safe... totally unforgettable,\" she said.\nWhat can the rest of the world learn from the way healthcare is delivered on islands?\n\"I've never been on an island yet where I felt like a bad doctor because generally you have the time and the setup that allows you to deliver great care, and that gets me out of bed in the morning,\" said Dr Payne.\n\"There are many islands where people living there don't have access to a hospital without getting on a ferry... it's the amazing general practice they receive that makes the difference.\"\nDr Payne will be in the Orkney islands with her family this Christmas and then she her sights on St Helena, a remote volcanic outpost in the South Atlantic Ocean.\nShe believes jobs like hers are \"the real antidote to people getting midcareer blues and thinking about early retirement\".\n\"Mixing it up and using your skills in a different setting can really bring the love back for what we do and so I would say to colleagues that are maybe feelings burnt out or disillusioned to just go for a short locum at one of these places, try something really different, because it really can bring the joy back.\"\nShe added: \"I get to be in these amazing places, working with incredible people and being able to make a difference when it matters most.\""}

We just could not believe it,\" she recalled.\nShe went on to document her unusual journey on Instagram. One update at 38 weeks asked: \"What the heck?! HOW have we made it this far?!\" \nThe UAB described her pregnancy as routine. Prof Richard Davis, who co-managed the delivery, pointed out that each baby had enjoyed \"extra space to grow and develop\".\nThis was because each baby had a womb to itself, he said - unlike in a typical twin pregnancy.\nMs Hatcher's labour was induced at 39 weeks, and required double the monitoring and charting at the hospital - as well as double the staffing.\nThis proved to be \"the most atypical\" part of Ms Hatcher's case, said Dr Shweta Patel from the hospital's obstetrics and gynaecology team.\nUAB staff did not have \"a lot of evidence or data\" to hand, Dr Patel told the BBC, and were required to apply their knowledge of typical pregnancies.\nSure enough, the babies had a \"mind of their own\", she said - and were delivered by different methods.\nThe first, Roxi, was born vaginally at about 19:45 local time on 19 December. The second, named Rebel, came by C-section more than 10 hours later. \nProf Davis said the girls could be called fraternal twins - a term used when each baby develops from a separate egg, each fertilised by a separate sperm.\n\"At the end of the day, it was two babies in one belly at the same time,\" he said. \"They just had different apartments.\""}

The aim of this channel is to reach 100,000 subscribers, or 500,000, or one million,\" he says.\nHe ends the short video saying \"peace out\" before walking out of view.\nJust over a year later, Awni became one of the first Palestinian children to be killed in the war. \nRelatives say Awni's family home was hit in an Israeli strike on 7 October, just hours after Hamas gunmen stormed across the border into Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 240 hostage.\nAwni's introductory video, in which he says thank you to his 1,000 subscribers, now has more than four million views. Other videos in which he voicelessly plays racing, battle and football games have millions more collectively.\nHis subscriber count has reached almost 1.5 million and continues to grow. \nComments flood in. \"Please forgive us, I wish we knew you before you died,\" one message says. Awni is a \"bird in heaven\", says another. \nTo his aunt, Ala'a, he was a \"very happy and confident\" boy who would hold the door open for her. Another family member called him \"engineer Awni\" because of his love of computers.\nTo others, this 13-year-old gamer has become a kind of symbol, representing the loss of children across the Gaza Strip. \nThe Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 20,000 people there have been killed since the war began - more than a third of them children. The UN children's agency (Unicef) has described it as the \"most dangerous place in the world to be a child\".\nThe day of the Hamas attack, as Israel began to retaliate, Ala'a imagined a bomb destroying her family's home in Gaza City. That night, she says her phone lit up with messages from friends: Awni's family home had been hit, at around 20:20.\nThe three-storey building was in the Zeitoun neighbourhood and a different branch of the family lived on each floor. \nOne was home to Awni, his mum and dad, his two older sisters, and two younger brothers.\nThe strike was also documented in October by human rights group Amnesty International. \n\"Two bombs fell suddenly on top of the building and destroyed it. My wife and I were lucky to survive because we were staying on the top floor,\" Awni's uncle Mohammed said. \nBoth he and a neighbour said they had received no warning. \"It was sudden, boom,\" the neighbour said.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not comment on this specific strike but said it was striking military targets and that Hamas had a \"documented practice of operating from nearby, underneath and within densely populated areas\".\nIt said: \"The IDF's strikes on military targets are subject to relevant provisions of international law, including the taking of feasible precautions and after an assessment that the expected incidental damage to civilians and civilian property is not excessive in relation to the expected military advantage from the attack.\"\nIt added that the IDF \"regrets any harm caused to civilians or civilian property as a result of its operations, and examines all its operations in order to learn and improve and ensure all activity was in accordance with operational procedures and the law\".\nAla'a didn't want to believe the messages she was receiving. But after connecting to the wi-fi, she saw that a close friend of the family had shared a photo of her brother on social media with the caption: \"Rest in peace.\" She ran to the hospital.\n\"They asked me to see the bodies but my husband refused… he wanted me to remember their beautiful faces when they were alive,\" she says in a Facebook message, sent from the south of Gaza, where she is now displaced.\nAla'a says 15 members of her family were killed that night, among them Awni. \nShe describes him as being a calm, helpful boy. His dad was a computer engineer and Ala'a says that for as long as she can remember, Awni would copy his father, pulling laptops apart and then trying to piece them back together. \nIn photos Awni shared on his own Facebook page, he stands in front of a blackboard holding up a computer motherboard to fellow students, as he leads a technology lesson organised as part of a \"little teachers\" scheme. Pictures published on his school's Facebook page show him winning numerous awards.\nShortly after his death, one of his teachers shared a photo with Awni, describing the boy's \"ever-lasting smile\".\nOutside of school, Ala'a says Awni loved spending time with his family. On one \"very wonderful night\", Ala'a says she watched a film with Awni and his siblings, sharing crisps and chocolates.\nThe last time she saw him was at a family breakfast three weeks before his death, where she looked at her nephew and said: \"Awni is becoming a man.\"\nMostly, Awni loved computers and gaming, and he idolised the YouTubers who made careers out of his hobby.\n\"He wanted to be like them - to have followers and fans,\" Ala'a says.\nAwni started his channel in June 2020. His videos show him playing Pro Evolution Soccer, the car racing game Blur and the first-person shooting game Counter-Strike.\nLong captions give details of the games, the companies that made them and the dates of their release.\nIn a video of Awni with an uncle, the pair promise a \"special\" range of content on the channel, declaring in unison: \"It will be a blast.\"\nThey grin and gesticulate as they take it in turns to talk. They say they plan to expand the channel to include vlogs and interviews. \nAshraf Eldous, a distant relative of Awni who works as a programmer and helps run several YouTube channels, says the teenager would frequently contact him asking for advice.\nIn messages from August 2022, shared with the BBC, Awni addresses \"brother Ashraf\" as he asks for YouTube tips. He would even take his father's phone in secret to ask for advice, Ashraf recalls.\nAshraf says the last time he spoke to Awni's father, he was told: \"Take care of Awni. Answer his questions. He's ambitious.\"\n\"His ambition was to be my competitor or colleague,\" Ashraf says. \"He created a YouTube channel. It wasn't that big, it didn't have any big views. Every start-up is hard at the beginning.\"\nBut after Awni's death in October, the views mounted when his fledgling channel caught the attention of established YouTubers, including Kuwaiti gamer AboFlah.\nIn an emotional video now viewed almost nine million times, AboFlah cries and walks away from the camera.\nHe has just discovered messages Awni had sent him on social media.\nOne of those message says: \"Nothing compares to Palestine's winter in Gaza; the atmosphere is legendary. We're drinking sahlab [a sweetened milk drink]. It's so good. We're also eating roasted chestnuts. I hope you come to Palestine. Much love.\"\nIn another, Awni writes to AboFlah: \"You're a legend and a role model.\"\nIn the video, as AboFlah weeps, he says: \"It's such a shame for this child to die… This child is one of many others who are even younger than him. If God wills it, they'll be birds of paradise.\"\n\"What you see is from the heart. I could not stop my tears,\" AboFlah tells the BBC, reflecting on the video he uploaded in October.\n\"It was very touching to hear that he looked up to me as a role model.\"\nAsked why he thinks Awni has made such a big impact, AboFlah says: \"Fans see themselves in Awni. We are all Awni.\"\nThe teenager's entire family - his four brothers and sisters and mother and father - were killed alongside him. But his surviving relatives say they are proud of the fame he has found after death.\n\"It's a gift from God that so many people around the world love Awni,\" says Ala'a.\n\"He used to talk about it enthusiastically, about his channel. He is more happy in heaven now.\"\nAdditional reporting by Muath Al Khatib"}

Israel has previously stressed that it takes steps to avoid civilian casualties, and blames Hamas for embedding itself in densely-populated areas.\nIsrael launched its retaliatory operation after Hamas fighters crossed from Gaza into southern Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages.\nMore than 20,000 people have been killed and 53,000 injured in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nIts update on Saturday said another 201 people had been killed and 368 others injured in the previous day alone.\nThe UN earlier announced that its aid worker Issam al-Mughrabi, 56, had been killed in a strike - along with his wife, children and more than 70 members of his extended family.\nIsrael announced that five more of its soldiers had been killed in fighting in Gaza, bringing the total to 144 to since it launched its ground operation.\nThe military has kept up its bombing campaign in Gaza - ordering civilians to flee.\nOn Saturday, it said one of its fighter jets had killed Hassah Atrash, a man it accused of smuggling weapons into Gaza to arm Hamas. There was no confirmation from Hamas.\nIn a separate development on Saturday, US President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed in a phone call Israel's ongoing military operation in Gaza.\nMr Biden \"emphasised the critical need to protect the civilian population including those supporting the humanitarian aid operation, and the importance of allowing civilians to move safely away from areas of ongoing fighting\", the White House said.\nMeanwhile, Mr Netanyahu \"made it clear that Israel would continue the war until all of its goals have been achieved\", the Israeli PM's office said.\nThe Israeli military has said it has almost full operational control of the north of the Gaza Strip, and is stepping up operations in the south.\nThe UN said the latest evacuation order affected 150,000 people in the middle of the territory.\n\"People in Gaza are people,\" commented Thomas White from UNWRA, the agency for Palestinian refugees. \"They are not pieces on a checkerboard - many have already been displaced several times.\"\nThe latest evacuation order impacted people in the Bureij refugee camp, who were told to head towards Deir al-Balah city further south.\nPalestinian news agency Wafa reported on Saturday that Bureij had been shelled - as had the Jabalia and Nuseirat camps, among other locations.\nA medic named Ziad told Reuters news agency he was left asking where to go, as there was \"no safe place\".\nAn adviser to the Israeli prime minister has acknowledged \"terrible suffering\" in Gaza - but told the BBC this was because the territory's Hamas leadership \"don't give a hoot\" for the people there.\nThe suffering \"shouldn't have happened\" but came about after a \"declaration of war\" by Hamas on 7 October, said Mark Regev.\nThe questioning of 200 new suspects was announced in a joint statement on Saturday by the Israeli military and internal security service Shin Bet.\nThe statement said this followed the arrests in Gaza of \"hundreds of suspects involved in terrorist activities\".\nThe BBC is not able to independently verify all battlefield claims. However, it did verify video earlier this month showing the detention of dozens of Palestinian men in the north Gaza Strip."}
