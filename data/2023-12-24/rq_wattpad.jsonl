She looks smug, and as much as I'd be happy to see her. I'm not. Because I'm sure what she's about to tell me isn't exactly why my ears want to hear.Behind her is the bodyguard she cares so much about. The only reason she has one is because our father is way too paranoid about safety for his only daughter. Guess he didn't really see his son needing one.I laughed at my own joke since my own father was practically my slave. She stands in front of me, smirk, and her blush pink suitcase rolled beside her. Behind her is Elion, who probably had to follow her to a thousand stores before they even stepped on the plane here to China. He's a handsome young boy, earns money out of this simple job, and is also like 27 so. Older than I am.\"Nat.\" She says, rolls it out like it's a curse, and gives me her best teasing grin. \"What?\" I ask, I don't really want to know, but I'm sure if I put up with her little fit right now, I might be able to sleep later. \"I've wanna meet your boy, where is he?\" I roll my eyes so hard I can hear them, \"A skater, he's a skater, not my boy.\"\"Same difference Nat, what's the fucking lining.\" She states sarcastically, giving me a crossed eyed look. I'm hoping Kabuki is so far away from here that she won't be able to harass him. He's already on edge already, I think he'd be panicking about the short program. He never gets it right. \"Get out of here, Ava. I have to go, and you're going to give my skater person trauma.\"\"Ha! You're skater! You said,'My skater,' admit it!\" \"Shut up.\" I snap, she's so annoying when she gets off an airplane, bothers everyone like she's attention starved.I love my sister. God, I have a soft spot for her, and I know it. But right now, she's not my favorite person. I recall our phone call, the reason I hoped she'd be late for the flight that is practically parallel with ours. \"Gosh, heart eyes for a gorgey boy! What a fucking improvement from all those very obviously drug dealers you hang on to.\" \"Ava, I don't hang on to anybody. I can't even date without it being a controversial news announcement.\" \"Ha! That is why this one will be fine. Romance between two skaters? Incroyable!\" \"I think, my girl, that you're forgetting it's between two male skaters.\"\"Ha! You admitted it! On a more serious note. Is there a difference?\" \"Of course.\" \"Whatever. Heart eyes. What will Suli think?\" At that name, my heart had stopped, what will he think? \"It doesn't matter.\" I say nonchalantly, \"Since when does he care?\" \"But he's‚Äî\"\"So?\"\"Fine, whatever, don't mind him. Go back to your ohhh tee peee.\"¬† \"My what?\" \"One true pairing? Duh.\"Then she hung up. She pushed me around, trying to get words out of me for a few measly minutes, and I felt a headache coming on. God, she can be so persistent about love. What love? There is no love, Avonat. But when I see Kabuki come towards me, his hair is tied in a half bun, and every single clothing he wears looks great, like a rich, stylish drug dealer. He isn't, but it looks good. And I can't ignore it, that something slightly flutters for a kid I just fucking met. _________________·¥Ö·¥á·¥Ä Ä  Ä·¥á·¥Ä·¥Ö·¥á Ä‚ïº‚ï∫‚ï∫‚ï∫‚ï∫‚ï∫‚ï∫‚ï∫‚ï∫ ‚ïæ Lol short chapter cause I'm running out of ideas for Avonats pov and I haven't done the drafts for the events leading up to chapter 10 and I basically pulled this out of my ass and this is turning into a cliche ass fucking book like love at first sight but as long as I keep myself sane it won't be cringe.

The body was faced down while his limbs were stretched like a sea star above the water. His tanned skin and ruffled matted black hair certainly matched the pictures of Hao Ran they viewed whilst entering, however he was topless with only a pair of what Liya could make out to be Ralph Lauren shorts.The clear pool was now tinted with the slightest shade of rose pink, fishing out the body at that moment were a few people in hazmat suits similar to Himari's. 'Forensics seems to be doing their job well', Kaili commented as she smiled.'Well, we have to', Himari answered before twirling her hair into a tight ballerina bun, small strands of its dyed candy apple color stuck out of place when she strapped on her latex gloves'This body is going straight to Ryuu', she stated, 'Hope he likes this gift at...12pm'Dongmin blinked, 'Ryuu?''He's the new forensics guy', she smirked, 'Real smoothtalker, at least he gets the job done''Luckily', he breathed under his breath, 'We'll get to talk to him right?'She nodded, 'I don't know about him though'Pointing at Chen Fang, she tilted her head, 'After all things are complicated between you guys''I'm also on the case', he answered simply, 'It's only fair I obtain the same information as the rest of the detectives'Glancing over at the others who made no attempt to object, she shrugged, 'Okay then', she answered right as the body was lifted on a portable medical bed and was carried away, 'We'll take more pictures around here, feel free to explore the house though because it's all at our disposal''I'd rather call the family and ask more questions', Dongmin suggested instead'Then you can go do that', Kaili chuckled, 'I'll continue with the girlfriend, learn more about her''I'll explore the victim's room', Liya decided, '..What about you Chen Fang?'He remained quiet before crossing his arms, 'I'll go with you', he answered as her face tinted with a cherry hue, 'Come let's go'Kaili grinned sneakily at her friend who followed like a confused lamb behind him as Dongmin sighed, 'He'll come around right?''He can't resist his girlfriend', she answered before giggling, 'Let's see how long he can resist for though'--DeleteCreated with Sketch.As they both inspected HaoRan's room, they couldn't help but feel as though they stepped into a luxury hotel. The pillowy white bed was arranged perfectly with silken beige and tanned cushions and hung on the walls were timeless pieces representing the roaring seas and the great mountains that overlooked the large room. Opposite the bed was a great glass door that led to a simple balcony where two chairs were placed facing the bloody pool below. 'Looks like it rained heavily last night', he picked up after peering through the thick glass to see droplets remaining on the chairs, 'His room looks pretty neat though'Liya immediately bent down to examine the expensive carpet, 'This shade...looks off', she murmured, flicking her eyes back and forth'What?'She pointed at a slight off white area at the edge of the pristine carpet, 'You see that too right?'He viewed it carefully before nodding, 'Bag it up then'As she tied up the evidence, she looked at him as he stared at the pool from the high distance above, 'Where did you go?', she asked, 'I'm genuinely curious'He stayed silent, refusing any attempt to answer before she exhaled patiently, 'I just want to know', she continued, standing up with a building frustration bubbling in her, 'I feel like, I deserve to know. After 6 months of having to deal with you just disappearing can't you just tell me?'The quietness only thickened and a ticking hanging wall clock was the only thing that could be heard for what seemed like centuries passing'Fine', she spat before facing HaoRan's walk in closet, 'Stay silent and go wherever you want. No one will stop you anymore and...no one will care anymore. It's not like you have a girlfriend or friends anymore anyway'His jaw tightened at her final words but he still kept his mouth shut and instead began envisioning what happened the night Hao Ran died. 'I'll tell her eventually', he kept reassuring himself, 'Eventually..'Snarling, Liya balled her hands into fists and knocked the hollow wood of HaoRan's filled shelves aggressively, 'He just-ARGH!', she complained aloud right as her eyes lay on a Jaeger-LeCoultre watch perfectly lined up with other silver rings and leather bands'Woah', she blurted intrigued by the classy items, 'But this..'She stopped in front of a wooden framed picture standing attentively on one of the higher shelves. Inside showed several beaming faces holding scrolls with red ribbons tied neatly around each identical one. 'Graduation', she read the black markered words at the bottom of the imageWhat made her pick up the frame wasn't Hao Ran who had his arms around two other jolly men but a scribbled and etched out face in the photograph. The markings were purposely there to ruin and remove whoevers face he clearly didn't want in the joyous memory. 'I'll be taking this', she chuckled, putting the photo in a clear bag'Liya..'She turned, eyeing Chen Fang who crept up behind her. He lowered his head slightly and lead against the closet doors awkwardly while she rolled her eyes, 'About earlier, I'm so-''Save it', she interrupted before stomping her boots past him, 'The closet is all yours now, I'm done here'And with that she walked away, the echoing clanking of her boots pounding into Chen Fang's head before he rubbed his temples, 'I think I messed up', he realized Walking further into the closet, he judged the rich cologne and the laundry detergent that hung onto all the tailored suits that looked like different trees covering each square foot of the space around him. At the back of what seemed to be an infinite wardrobe, he expected to have reached another world by now just like his favorite book, however he saw a large  safe instead. It was immovable and a simple pin pad was what kept whatever secrets it stored safely insideBending down near it's sturdy edges, he touched it briefly and his hand jolted back in surprise, 'It's loose', he realized, 'It's been opened'He wedged his finger in between the door and pushed it gently. When it refused to budge, he gripped it tighter and ripped it open furiously. It's hinges screamed and the door lay open widely while he investigated using his phone flashlight. A few antique coins and diamond encrusted Rolex's dazzled against the bright light however he realized that they were arranged in a strange way, as though they were meant to fit around something. 'Someone took something from here', he determined, 'I doubt Hao Ran left this open intentionally before his death'He rubbed his thumb on the cool metal surface in thought, 'Watch it be some documents. All victims love to hide those'Sneaking out of the room, he noticed Liya slowly turning the doorknob to another room East of where he was standing. His eyes trailed her in amusement as her serious face reminded him of a bunny furiously trying to much a carrot. 'She became cuter somehow', he said to himself, 'Liya'She stood up straight sharply at the sound of her voice before scoffing, 'Oh it's you', she looked at him as he lumbered towards her, 'Why don't you-'He clamped his hand over her mouth to silence her, 'I'm going to investigate this room with you whether you like it or not'She struggled to scream and her words twisted into a muffled lump, 'Deal with it', he suddenly smirked before releasing herOnce freed, she couldn't help but feel shocked yet in awe that he suddenly found the courage to acknowledge her again, 'Fine', she answered quietly after he entered the next room, 'I'll deal with it'"}

Indulging her, I tell her as much as I can remember until we reach the front of the queue and receive our lunch for the day: undercooked chicken with some kind of vegetables.\"Ooh look, Ruby and Katherine are over there!\" Charlotte nudges me excitedly, after scanning the crowded dining hall and spotting our two friends at a small table.¬† \"Should we go sit with them?\"\"Yeah sure,\" I shrug nonchalantly and we both make our way over.¬† As we near their table, we can start to hear some of their conversation even through the chaotic noises in the dining hall. \"Oh my gosh, that's so exciting!\" Katherine gushes to Ruby just as Charlotte and I put our trays down and sit next to our friends at the table.\"What's exciting?\" I ask as I glance back and forth between them, not happy to be left out of the loop.Ruby glances down sheepishly, while Katherine is more than glad to share the discussion with the newcomers. \"Ruby's date with Zac, obviously!\" she exclaims, her eyes sparkling like stars at the fairytale-like romance she has no doubt already imagined in her mind.Charlotte gasps in excitement while my heart feels like someone's put a heavy weight on it, though I try to appear as enthusiastic as her. \"For the last time, Katherine, it's not a date!\" Ruby chastises, her voice muffled, with her head in her hands to hide the blush blossoming across her cheeks.\"Um, you sure about that, girl?\" Katherine crosses her arms, a sure sign that she's about to go into analysis mode.¬† \"First of all, he asked you to go to town with him, and even if he didn't specify it's a date, it's pretty much implied.¬† Second of all, when a boy and a girl hang out together ‚Äî alone, might I add ‚Äî it's pretty clear to me that it's a date.¬† And third of all, when said boy and girl have already kissed once before and are now texting each other all the time, surely you see what this means?\"\"This is all just speculation,\" Ruby counters.¬† \"He might just want someone to hang out with.¬† We're just two friends meeting up for not-a-date.\"\"Riiiight,\" Katherine nods her head slowly, not believing her words.¬† \"Come on, Ruby, have some confidence in yourself!¬† It's obvious he likes you.\"Ruby raises her head at this.¬† \"You really think so?\"\"Yeah, of course!\" Charlotte chimes in.¬† \"You're a smart beautiful girl, and he'd be lucky to have you.\"Fiddling with her nails, Ruby turns to me and asks, \"What do you think, Isla?\"Suddenly nervous, I glance around the table, wondering if anyone will come to my rescue at such a targeted question, but Charlotte merely keeps her gaze down while Katherine raises an eyebrow at me as if to say \"your call\".I bite my lip, thinking hard.¬† Obviously I don't want her to date Zac, especially when they haven't even known each other for a week.¬† But who am I to stop Ruby from pursuing what I can see she wants?¬† \"Go for it, Ruby,\" I encourage her.¬† \"I can tell he likes you as much as you like him.\"There's a look in Ruby's eyes that I can't decode.¬† If I don't know better, I might actually think that it's disappointment.¬† But it can't be.¬† I know for a fact that Ruby's been gushing over Zac ever since they met.¬† Perhaps she just doesn't think I'm sincere in my encouragement?\"You really think so?\" Ruby enquires once again, unknowingly rubbing salt in the wound.I look her in the eye, put on the sincerest expression I can muster, and say, \"Yes, I really think so.¬† Stop worrying so much.\"She gave me a small smile, a sign that she believes me.¬† \"Okay,\" she replies timidly, and that is the end of it.¬† After that, we return to more mundane topics as we steer the conversation back into calmer waters. ***\"That's it for today, class,\" Miss Jackson announces just in time for the bell signalling the end of the school day to ring.¬† \"Can you all please read up to chapter 33 of the novel for next week?\"I sigh in exhaustion as I dump my copy of Pride and Prejudice into my bag, glad the lesson is finally over.¬† English is no easy subject, especially with all the reading between the lines and vague interpretations, which is definitely not one of my strong suits.I return to my own form room and perch on one of the desks, waiting for Ruby, like I do every single week.¬† As I wait, I decide to take out my book to get started on the English reading homework.¬† I'm only 2 pages in before I hear a pair of footsteps entering the room. \"Hey, Ruby,\" I greet her as I raise my head from the novel.\"Hi, Isla,\" she says but doesn't sit.¬† \"I know we made plans to hang out every Thursday after school, but I gotta go to town now.¬† I'm sorry.\"\"Oh,\" I say, the disappointment clear in my tone.¬† But then I remember, and I try to act less upset and more excited.¬† \"It's your date with Zac, right?\"\"Yeah, and once again, not a date,\" Ruby replies.¬† \"We're meeting at 3:45, and it takes at least 10 minutes to walk to town, and that's if I walk fast.¬† I should probably be going now.\"¬† She hovers at the door, and it dawns on me that she's implicitly apologising for not hanging out with me today, even though we made plans.\"Yeah, no problem,\" I shrug, disguising my dismay under a layer of nonchalance.¬† \"You better walk fast then.¬† Don't wanna be late.\"\"Right,\" Ruby nods.¬† \"Bye then, see you tomorrow.\"She leaves, and once again I feel a sort of emptiness in my heart, but I dismiss the feeling, knowing that nothing good will come out of descending down the rabbit hole of misery.Letting out a sigh, I collect my belongings and head over to the music department, deciding that some time alone on the harp can get my mind off things and is also a relaxing pastime.However, as soon as I enter the music building, I come face to face with Elena.\"You again?\" I exclaim, exasperated.¬† \"Do you really have nothing better to do with your time than pissing me off?\"\"Not everything revolves around you, Isla,\" Elena teases, her tone still playful while mine is annoyed.¬† \"I actually came here to practise, believe it or not.\"I look at her dubiously.¬† \"Right.¬† You play an instrument?\"\"Mhm,\" Elena nods, \"I play the cello.\"I must admit, I am shocked by this revelation.¬† I never thought that Elena of all people would be good at music or anything remotely academic.¬† I always assumed that since she's the queen bee, she's different from the rest of us commoners.¬† But I guess I was being unfair and prejudiced.\"Huh,\" I say lamely, still too surprised to make a proper response.¬† \"Well, have fun practising then.\"¬† With that, I start to make my way up the stairs, on a mission to find an empty practice room with a harp for me to play.***\"Isla!\" Nisha shakes my shoulder, startling me out of my stupor. \"Isla, you're lucky Miss Forrester hasn't noticed you zoning out all lesson,\" she whispers.¬† \"Come on, we're meant to be doing this worksheet here.\"\"Oh right, sorry, just tired,\" I mumble before I refocus my gaze on the questions on the sheet. It's the second-to-last lesson on a Friday afternoon, and nothing can make the students more excited and restless than the prospect of a relaxing weekend ahead of us.¬† Which is why almost no one is listening in class anymore, with most of them having long since given up on understanding the concept of electrolysis. Skimming through the class notes, I try to absorb the information as quickly as possible before embarking on the questions with Nisha.¬† Before long, the bell rings just as we complete the final question on the sheet.I let out a sigh of exhaustion as I pack my things away and head over to the art department for my last lesson of the week.\"Okay, everyone, settle down,\" Mr Li hollers when the majority of the class has arrived.¬† \"Today, you'll just be working on your projects and organising your sketchbook.\"Okay, easy enough, I think to myself as I get started on my individual work without any distractions. Just before I come face to face with the biggest distraction I can possibly have at the moment. Elena and her two sidekicks, Sabrina and Yvonne.¬† Out to make my life hell. \"Hey, Isla,\" Sabrina drawls as she makes her way over to my desk. I ignore her and keep my eyes trained on my sketchbook.¬† It's taking every ounce of my self-control not to snap back at her. \"What's wrong, darling?\" Yvonne follows her, refusing to miss out on the fun.¬† \"Aren't we all friends here?¬† It's not nice to ignore your friends.\"\"Not to be rude, but would you kindly piss off?\" I growl at them both.¬† \"I've got work to do.\"Yvonne looks like she wants to give me a piece of her mind, a mock offended expression on her face, but before she can, their ringleader calls them back. \"Come on, girls,\" Elena exclaims all the way on the other side of the room by the paint station.¬† \"Let's leave Isla to her work.¬† Besides, we've got things to do ourselves.\"¬† After hearing that, Sabrina and Yvonne leave me to my own devices, ever the obedient sidekicks, but not before sneering and glaring at me.I stare at Elena, confused.¬† I thought for sure that she'd utilise this opportunity to tease me relentlessly.¬† Did she get bored of me that quickly?¬† Why am I even caring so much?¬† Shouldn't I be glad that she's not singling me out anymore?¬† Or is it just because she wants to be in charge of things herself and doesn't want it to be initiated by Sabrina and Yvonne. Elena Quinn really confuses me a lot. But seriously, why do I even care?A week ago, Elena was merely a stranger to me.¬† Granted, she wasn't just a normal face in the crowd; I knew her as the perfect queen bee.¬† But why have I been affected so much in just five days?Why can't I get her out of my head?"}

The ladies understood their confusion and said in unison\" Aap mardon mein see koi bhi do din take ghar ke bahar nahi jayenge \"All the men looked at them with horror and wished that they were just joking and teasing them but the look on their faces already told them that it was serious but the question was 'Why?'.The ladies who were giggling looking at their condition laughed out loud when Avanti said \" Waise bhi jija ji ladke to kahi jate hi kahan hai to kya farak padta hai agar aap do din ghar mein rahenge\" She said in her sarcastic tone.Now all the other men were looking at 'Mr. Vineet Shekhawat ' for his explanation for this blunder and her Vineet realised what he did.¬†He looked at all of them and just said\" Kya meri taraf kyun dekh rahe ho sab meri koi galti nahi hai vo bas galti see bol diya that inhone serious le liya usmein mein kya karun\"All of them now took his side not wanting to let the ladies win and said supporting him\" aur nahi toh kya bacha sahi hi to keh raha hai kya galat hai ismein hum mard kaam ke alava bahar jate hi kahan hai \" his grandfather said taking his grandson's side.Suddenly Vaishali Shekhawat snapped back at him saying \" Ohho hoo aap to budhe ho chale hain lekin hai to mard hi kaise apni galti manenge, chaliye zara andar aapko bata te hain hum \" she said the last part that was only audible to him.Now all of them were sitting for dinner when in between Vineet got a call from his friends he just picked up and said \" haan bhai vo kuch kaam hai to nahi aa paunga \" and cut the call without waiting for the response.When he was about to put a morsel of food again his phone rang and the person on the line told him to come or meet them after years. He murmured a sorry to the person and began eating his food.Everyone had moved to their room when Vineet entered the room he found that Yashashvini was taking her blanket and pillow and was coming towards the door, she whispered to him \"Good night\"When she was about to move out of the room her wrist was caught by him and he pulled her towards himself making their front bodies collide with each other.¬†He tucked the hair strands falling on her face and asked her in his husky voice \" Where are you going biwi ?\" She removed his hand which was now travelling to her waist and opened the door.She said \" MR. let me remind you mein aapse naraz hun nahi nahi aap jaiye bahar ab dekhna kaise aap ghar mein rukoge aur mein bahar ghumti rahungi \" She showed her tongue to him and went away.Vineet said \" thik hai biwi ab aapko do din ghar mein rehke dikhayenge aur haan jahan aapke Mr. rahenge wahin pe aap rahengi to hume chodkar aap ko kahin nahi jane denge hum \" he said with a smirk plastered on his face.They all fell asleep while pondering about the challenge.-------------Yashashvini's POVIt was morning and we all decided to go for shopping while leaving our husbands at home only Aditya was allowed.

Vo... Bandar...¬† I mean Aditya vo kyun chal raha hai plan to sab ladko ko ghar pe chhor ke jane ka tha na.. vo bhi to ladka hai \" I was just saying \" Nahi...\" when she cut me saying \" Kya matlab vo ladka nahi hai\" with horror in her eyes.I face-palmed myself and explained to her that he was not at fault so this punishment was only for the married men. She just rolled her eyes and went to the bathroom while I moved outside for breakfast.We were sitting at the table when Avanti came and sat between me and Aditya as that was the only seat left.While Papa asked \" Adi beta teri maa , meri maa aur meri bahu humein to leke ja nahi rahi to tu inke shopping bags utha to lega na \"¬†Aditya responded \" Haan papa mein utha lunga aur aap dusri bahu lao to sahi mein toh uske nakhre bhi utha lunga \"he said the last part in a low tone which was only audible to me and Avanti and suddenly he winked at Avanti.I choked my food in shock while Vineet rubbed my back and Aditya passed me the water.¬†I need to talk to him.

I hear a constant beeping. Realizing that it was all just a vivid dream, an illusion my subconscious made left me with a hole.I wasn't sure what my reality is anymore, until I hear someone shouting: \"Doctor, please hurry, she woke up!\". A moment later, I see a man dressed in a white coat and a mask over his face. He flashes my eyes with a flashlight, asking me absurd questions of my knowledge. But honestly, I'm confused myself. My head is spinning, and it's hard to focus. I say my name and ask what happened. He talks with someone about my current situation and what to do next, but I couldn't process anything that came out of his mouth. I lay down and close my eyes, feeling weak and fragile. A few hours later , My mom is staying with me at the hospital and brought me more comfortable clothes. I kept spacing out during lunch, and the long silence between me and my mother wasn't what was bothering me. Instead, I couldn't remember what caused this emptiness. The doctor said that the accident caused selective amnesia. He said that the very thing that was causing me distress is what I have fogotten. I can't remember anything since the night that I went clubbing. My parents have been trying to fill my head with the happenings of the past few months, but nothing seems familiar. As if they never happened to me. Months passed since I was released from the hospital. My parents are very strict and track my every move. They bought this beautiful anklet with a tracker built in. At first, it felt reassuring for me, knowing my parents know where I am and can act asap when something happens. But now they are just controlling. Every dinner, I have to tell them what I am doing the next day, where and with whom, it's insane!!! I understand they are just worried about my well-being, but they completely ignore that I need my privacy. Normal was something that was completely foreign to me now, since the hospitalisation. There is not a single day that my parents let me forget what had happened and the consequences. Weeks after finding out I had amnesia and they gave up, trying to recover my memories. Thinking it was unnecessary stress and work, \" a waste of my time.\" I asked my friends, my now ex-boyfriend, everyone that I could think of, but no one told me anything, saying they didn't know either. Lost. I feel lost. Stuck in time. A year ago, I was having a normal friday night. Now I am just the debris of my old self. I can't recognize myself anymore when I look in the mirror. I don't feel myself anymore around my friends. I lost track of what my life was all about, all since that regretful night.Exhausted I go straight to my room and minutes later our housekeeper delivers me a letter. There was no sender address, and the handwriting was unfamiliar to me. I opened the letter and read it carefully. \" Hey, little pup,I heard you've gotten out of the hospital. I hope you're better now. I also heard that you've gotten an amnesia, don't worry, I will make sure you remember me. Just know that I wish nothing but your safety and happiness. I hope we can meet each other soon.Yours truly.\"Weird, they might have sent it to the wrong address. Although to think about it. How many people live in the same neighborhood that got an amnesia a few months ago? Disregarding the letter, I start preparing for tomorrow's classes. I pack my lunch, prep my clothes, whatever I need tomorrow morning so that I don't have to get up early and can just stand up at the last minute. These days, I really struggle to stand up and get out of my bed. I often overslept and missed my morning classes, and my parents keep saying I'm probably not ready for school yet. Maybe I have to rest a little bit more before stressing myself to keep up with people my age. They keep telling me it's fine and I can just get started with an online program. For me, it didn't sound like they were worried if it was physically too hard and stressful. It sounded more like, stay home so we can keep a better eye on you. To be honest, I've thought about it, not to ease my parent's worry, but to gain more control of my time. To feel like it's moving again, to feel productive, to feel busy, anything... really just to feel anything. Because school isn't obviously doing it for me. By dinner time, all I could think about was my bed. I feel tired all the time and my parents keep asking about what I'm going to do tomorrow, you know our now usual dinner talk. I told them tomorrow's schedule and went straight to bed, not wanting to argue about this topic again. Before going to sleep, I open my windows and get ready for bed. It feels good to have the cool night breeze in my room. It makes me calm. I look at the forest where this accident happened, where they've found me the next morning, barely breathing due to frostbite. They said I was found with patched wounds and different clothes, but I wasn't moving at all. I try to remember what I was doing in that forest. Generally, I feel like the night I went clubbing wasn't so long ago,but to know that it's been a year just frustrates me because I can't remember anything. Even before waking up from my coma, I felt like I just woke up from such a vivid dream that I couldn't remember. I sigh, close the window, and plant myself in my bed. I close my eyes and try to fall asleep. I keep tossing and turning 'till I find the right position and let sleep take over me.\"Are you lost little pup?\"\"Do me a favor little pup, never walk alone in the dark ever again. It is dangerous.\"\"This is it. This is how I die. Chasing a stranger into the dark forest and falling to my own death. I wonder...\""}

As I awaken, my mom's words catch my attention. \"Someone's here to see me?\" I inquire, still shaking off the remnants of sleep. \"I'll be down in a minute,\" I add. I shoot out of bed, hastily doing my morning routine. I throw on a pair of loose fit, denim cargo pants, with a cream, sleeveless corset top, topping it off with my basic air forces. I make my way down stairs, anxious about the unexpected visitor. \"Mom, what the fuck is he doing here.\" My mom glances over at me, \"Sophia, language, he said he needed to talk to you it was urgent. I thought this would be a great way to make things right with you too.\" I am furious. \"I don't have time for this, I'm going you school.\" I grab my belongings as I make my way out the door. \"Let me take you,\" he insists. \"Hell no, I'd rather walk to school then be alone with you,\" I snap. I proceed to walk to school as anger fills my body, why would my mom allow him in our house after what he did to me. Throughout the day, I didn't even want to speak to anyone, protecting my emotions swirling within. At the end of the day, I ran up to Julian, \"Julian wait,\" he stops in place turning his body's towards my direction. I wrap my arms around him, \"Julian please please please help me.\" I beg. \"What happened, is everything okay?\" He asks in concern, his voice reflecting the worry etched on his face. \"Can you come over, I don't want to be home alone with him.\" He looks at me confused. \"With who Sophia?\" He asks. I sigh, \"my ex Jake, back in Chicago, he came over wanting to talk saying it's urgent.\" Julian's concern deepens as he processes your words. \"Of course, I'll come over,\" he reassures. \"Thank you,\" I look up at him with a smile. Julian drove us to my house, ready to face the unexpected situation together. Julian holds my hand for comfort, leading the way inside. \"Sophia, we need to talk.\" He says with a brief pause. \"Who the hell is this,\" he asks, his tone quickly changed once he seen Julian. \"My boyfriend, Julian. Whatever you need to say, you can say it to both of us.\" I assert. We all go upstairs to my room, as Julian sits on my bed, I proceed to sit on his lap, as he wraps his arms around my waist. Making Jake feel uncomfortable. \"So what's so important that you had to come all the way here.\" He sighed, \"Ashlyn is in the hospital, I wanted to tell you in person so you can fly back with me, she really wants to see you. I also wanted to try to work things out with you, I miss you.\"Feeling the weight of the news about Ashlyn, I take a deep breath, processing the mix of emotions, I respond, \"I'm sorry to hear about Ashlyn, but things between us are in the past. I've moved on, and I will not work things out with you, you ruined that for yourself. I've met my forever person who treats me with respect and love. Julian has been there for me in ways you never were. I wish Ashlyn the best, but my place is here now, and I won't be going back.\" I say, drawing a clear line between the past and present. \"I didn't expect you to just move on like this,\" Jake finally speaks, his tone carrying a hint of frustration. \"But if that's how it is, then fine. Good luck with your new life,\" he adds, the words carrying a touch of bitterness. \"Why wouldn't I move on? I'm not going to lock my life away feeling sorrow. You cheated on me with my best friend, I deserve someone like Julian, someone who respects and supports me no matter what, I love him.\" I assert. Julian starts rubbing my hips and thighs, bringing me comfort and support as I let out my anger. After a moment of silence, his words speaks with a dull tone, \"I messed up, Sophia. I know that now. I hope you find the happiness you deserve.\" His words carry a sense of regret, hinting at a recognition of the consequences of his actions. \"It was worth trying, I guess I will make my way out.\" He says as he exits my room, closing the door behind him.\"Your boyfriend huh? And you love me?\" Julian says with a smirk. I turn around facing him, still sitting on his lap, locking my arms behind his neck. Smiling at Julian's playful remark, \"I may have fibbed a bit but I do love you,\" I respond. \"Well, I love you too.\" We both exchanged smiles, \"Thank you for being here with me, I don't know what would have happened if you weren't.\" Julian responds with a gentle smile, \"I'll always be here for you, Sophia. No matter what comes our way, we face it together.\"I lean in, pressing his lips on mine. We both release gazing into each other eyes for a brief moment, looking down at each other's lips, before we began kissing again. The connection deepens, each moment reinforcing the love and support we find in one another. Eventually, we ease back, savoring the closeness as I rest my forehead against his, taking a moment to simply be together. \"You're so perfect,\" he whispers, his voice carrying a tender warmth. I give him one more kiss on the lips, \"you're the perfect one.\" I won't deny, I have caught feelings for this boy. Apart from the bad boy act he showed me at first, I found the warmth in his heart, revealing the genuine love and care he has for me. The way he always hypes me up, supports me through any situation I've been put in, always listening. I don't know what I would do without him.\"Im so exhausted,\" I yawn. \"Lay down get some rest, it's been a crazy couple of days,\" he said, gently tucking a cozy blanket around me. He lays next to me, with a big smile on his face, tucking my hair behind my ear. As I closed my eyes, his touch lingered like a gentle lullaby, making it peaceful going to sleep.\"Kennedy is here\" my mom yelled from downstairs. Kennedy came running up the stairs, blasting her way into my room. Kennedy's eyes widened as she entered, and a mischievous grin played on her lips. \"Well hello, looks like I interrupted something,\" she teased, raising an eyebrow. I shot out of bed, \"holy shit Kennedy, you scared me.\" Kennedy laughed, \"Oops, my bad. Didn't mean to startle you, but seriously, what's going on here?\" she asked with a playful smirk.\"We weren't doing anything just took a nap, my ex came and he helped me out a bit.\" I explain. Julian came over to me, hugging me from behind, \"What up Kennedy.\" She raises an eyebrow in confusion, \"so you guys sure nothing is going on?\" I nod, \"I'm positive.\" Kennedy's skepticism still lingered around the room, \"hmm okay if you say so. Anyways there is a party going on tonight, wanna come?\" She asks. I look up at Julian, he nods in agreement, \"sure I'm down.\" Kennedy jumps in excitement, \"perfect let's get ready!\"I let Julian pick out my outfit again, he picked out a rhinestone, chain detailed, backless bra/halter top, paired with black leather jeans, diamond hoop earrings, and rhinestone stiletto heels to complete the look. Julian's eyes light up as he sees the complete ensemble, \"you're so gorgeous,\" he says as he's grabbing my waist pulling me close. \"Um hello I'm still here lovebirds,\" Kennedy says with a playful smirk, interrupting the moment. \"Save the romance for later, we've got a party to attend, and you two are stealing the spotlight already,\" she adds, leading the way with a chuckle.We all get in the car making our way to the destination. Julian steps out of the car, then proceeds to open my door for me, grabbing my hand as I step out of the car. \"You going to open mine Julian?\" Kennedy teases with a grin. Julian winks and swiftly moves to open Kennedy's door, \"of course Kennedy, wouldn't want to leave you out,\" as he playfully opens Kennedy's door, earning a laugh from all of us. He grabs my hand as we make our way into the entrance of the party. All eyes are on me and Julian, \"damn how'd you pull that one J,\" his friend said dapping him up. \"I don't know bro,\" he looks at me with a smile, looking at me up and down. \"I'll catch you in a bit,\" Julian says making his way over to his friends while me and Kennedy hunt for the alcohol.\"Hey soph, you're looking beautiful as always,\" Preston says with a smirk, handing me a shot. \"Thank you,\" I say with a smile. \"You wanna go somewhere private?\" He asks. \"Sure why not,\" I say as I follow him upstairs to a bedroom. \"I seen you came with Julian again, are you sure you guys aren't together,\" he asked with a concerned look on his face. \"I promise we aren't together Preston,\" reassuring him. \"So that means I can do this,\" he says leaning towards me, pressing his lips on mine. It completely caught me off guard. He leans me back, making his way on top of me. \"I thought you wanted to take things slow,\" I say continuing the kiss. \"I couldn't help myself,\" he whispers as he takes my shirt off, massaging my breasts. \"Preston I don't think..,\" he places his finger in my lips, \"Shh, no need to say anything right now. Let's just enjoy the moment,\" Preston murmurs, his gaze intense. He proceeds to take off his clothes as he does the rest of mine, putting his length inside of me.I roll my eyes back letting out a gentle moaning. He places his hand on my neck with one hand, lifting up my leg with the other, thrusting faster. \"I've been wanting to do this since I first laid my eyes on you,\" he says. I wanted to stop for the sake of Julian, but I was caught up in the moment. He turns me around, arching my back with my ass up. He starts rubbing his length on my area, teasing me. \"Quit teasing, go inside already.\" He chucked grabbing my hips as he pushed himself inside. I gasped, \"You like that,\" he processed to thrust fast, smacking my ass. \"Yes, like that\" I moan, As I start to rub myself giving me more pleaser. He flips me over, holding my head near his length. \"Open your mouth,\" he insists. I do as he says as he jerks himself off until he came into my mouth. I look up at him as I scoop the rest off my face with my thumb inserting it in my mouth, swallowing the rest. \"Fuck that was hot,\" he says as he dresses himself back up.I proceed to put my clothes on as well, \"well I didn't see that coming,\" I giggle. \"Round 2 later?\" He asks with a smirk. \"I don't know Julian, we'll see.\" My eyes widen. \"I'm sorry I meant Preston.\" I can sense the anger rising within him. \"Julian huh. I see how it is,\" he says walking out the door making his way downstairs. \"Preston wait,\" I ran downstairs to see him talking to Julian. I pause for a brief moment, as Julian looks at me with disappointment, shaking his head. Out of no where Julian pushed Preston down, \"fuck you.\" Preston stood back up, getting in Julian's face, \"What are you gonna do about it pussy.\" Julian looks at me once more as he begins swinging, punching Preston in the face. I put my hand on my mouth, in shock. \"Guys fucking stop,\" I yell. The whole crowd of people has their eyes on me. \"This does not need to happen again, over me especially. Look Preston, I'm sorry but that was a mistake.\" Preston looks at me in disbelief. I grab a bottle of alcohol, making my way outside sitting near the edge of the pool soaking my feet in the water. I'm filled with regret, I don't know why I did that knowing my feelings towards Julian. I continue to down the bottle, as I sense someone coming near me me. \"Soph.\" I close my eyes, shedding a tear. \"Soph look at me,\" I turn my head towards his direction, with hurt in my eyes. He placed his hand on my cheek. \"Hey it's okay, no need to cry,\" he says as he wipes my tears away.\"I'm such a horrible person, I don't know why I did that, I'm such a whore everyone is right about me,\" he grabs my hand lifting me up. \"Your drunk, let me take you home.\" I nod as tears continue to run down my face. Everyone starts to whisper as he takes me back into the house, \"everyone shut the fuck up,\" he says making our way out the entrance. He carries me into the car, and proceeds to take me back home. \"I'm so sorry Julian,\" I cry as he lays me down into my bed. He shushes me, \"don't apologize, it's already been done.\" He tucks me into bed, \"can you lay with me,\" I ask. \"Of course,\" he says as he lays next to me, looking me in my eyes. \"I'm so so sorry Julian,\" I place my hand on his cheek. \"Come on get some rest,\" he says, taking my hand off his cheek. I nod, closing my eyes, allowing the weight of the moment to settle. \"Julian,\" I whisper. \"Yes Sophia,\" he whispers back. \"I like you, like a lot.\" I admit. The room echoed with silence for a moment. \"Your drunk Sophia, get some sleep please.\" Julian's voice carries a gentle concern, his eyes reflecting a mix of emotions. \"Let's talk about it when you're feeling more yourself. Get some rest,\" he murmurs, wrapping his arm around me, giving me warmth and comfort, as I drift into a restless sleep."}

Like comment and just enjoy reading!-Dumb idiot ü§åüèæ Word count:1.1k-¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬† .~.¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† -ShadeThey told me to wait. Wait in a room that was filled with nothing. Well sort of nothing there were only 2 chairs made of plastic not so sharp, a table that was screwed to the floor and a plastic wall that separated me and the person that was interviewing me. They said I was dangerous. That I did something, but my parents raised me to not do what I wasn't supposed to so how could I have? They told me to count sheep if I got bored but who wants to count sheep? Sheep always were weird to me. How does counting sheep help? If counting sheep helps then why don't we start counting cows? Or donkeys? Or humans? Or corpses? Whenever someone says the word sheep you think of an animal with 4 legs a white woolly coat at a barn that is painted red but well. When people say sheep I just think of a sheep on it's back flailing it's legs trying to get up. It always cracks me up. What? You thought I was gonna say a murdered sheep? I admit I'm weird but I'm not psycho. I looked around the room. Soft mats on the walls like I was in a mental asylum. I always wondered what it would be like in an asylum now I get the gist of it. I look around and find a door a steel door. And at the exact same time the steel door banged open. Soldiers and Officers walked in followed by a short and stoic man. Every time in movies the interviewer is a man. Why not a women? The man said something inaudible. I raised an eyebrow it sounded a lot like gibberish. The man sighed than cleared his throat with a cough. And again said the same gibberish. An officer whispered in his ear. The man nodded and again said something but this time I heard it. \"Shade\" he was calling my name. \"Yah?\" I answered boredly. \"So you answer to the name shade and not AÃ∏ÃãÕÅÃ´Ã¨ÃòÃºiÃ∏ÃÅÃâÕåÃÑÃùÃ≥ÃùÃôÕâaÃ∂ÃÄÃïÃçÃØÃ¶Ã™kÃ¥ÃàÃÉÃêÃÅÃ∞?\" The last word sounded like gibberish to me, it also sounded like the letters were in the wrong place somehow. It didn't really matter though. \"No? I don't even know what you said\" I answered truthfully. \"Hmm.. well no time to lose\" he said and opened the folder in his hands. It had many documents. I leaned forward to see what those documents were. They were documents of me. My birthday, birthplace, name, age, where I went to school, work, who my family was and all their info. It was a lot. And they had it all. \"So uh.... What is this about? And can we hurry this up? I have work to catch\" I wasn't necessarily lying I just wasn't saying the whole truth. \"You can't go to work\" the man said. I looked up and saw chestnut eyes that felt like they were trying to find out what I was supposed to mean or be. I wouldn't let them. I made my face go blank as I looked back. \"Why not?\" I asked taking in a breath of air. \"You're dangerous\" he said \"You forgot the 'allegedly'\" I said. I knew the case that was being held against me. Somehow. \"No no, no allegedly, we now it's you we just need to find all the proof\" he said flipping through the papers. \"How?\" I asked growing irritated what did this man have to proclaim he knew I was evil? He didn't I don't know this guy and he's already saying I'm evil. \"We found you at the crime site with blood on your hands, clothes and face and a smile like you were happy that they died\" he explained, \"that shows why\" he stopped flipping the pages. \"Killed who?\" I asked confused, this was a horribly confusing process.\"Your friends\" he said calmly. \"What friends?\" I asked. \"What do you mean what friends?\" He asked back now it was his turn to be confused. \"Your friends, Sprout, River, Rain, Ace, Millow and Yasina\" he said, \"Millow, Yasina and Rain survived but with major injuries the others sadly did not\" I had no idea of what this guy was talking about. I didn't have any friends with the name Sprout, River, Rain, Ace, Millow or Yasina.¬† But I did have friends. 6 to be exact. I stared at the man than down at the file he had in his hand. \"This is a picture of you guys\" he showed me the picture he was holding. He pushed it through a slot that allowed him to show documents and files to the interviewe. I stared and saw my friends. But why were they called differently? I saw 7 people, 1 girl with short cropped green hair that was really messy in the back she had a smile on her face and pencils and a art book in her hand, 1 girl with long wavy/straight black hair a laughing face and a book in her hand. 1 person had long hair that was dyed at the ends red and golden brown, the top was just a milk chocolate brown. They had a smile and I saw their eyes were brown, they weren't holding anything but had a satchel with a strap on their shoulder. Another girl had brown hair with pink/ purple dyed tips in a ponytail, her smile felt genuine and forced at the same time and she had a phone with a purple cover plants and flowers were engraved in it in her hand. Another person had short curly hair that ran over their eyes, a cat hat sat neatly on their head, they like the person with red dyed tips had a satchel with a strap on their shoulder. And the last person was me. My short dark brown hair hanging loose around my shoulders, my eyes radiated kindness and warmth my arms wrapped around the shoulders of the girl with black hair and the girl with green messy hair.

He was as tired as a dog. Being the CEO was no easy job. If anyone had told him in the past that he was going to start his own business in the past, he would have laughed at them on their faces. He was always told that he would join the family business once he was done with his studies. Yet, he was, owning a company worth millions. He felt rather proud of himself for having stepped out of his parent's protective barriers and explored his talents.Slinging his bag on his shoulder he headed out of his office.\"I thought you already went home,\" Ui, the guy from the company next door spoke as they were waiting for the elevator.Even though Ohm did buy the whole building, his company didn't need that much area. Hence he rented out a few floors to startups as an alternate form of income.\"No, had some pending work\" Ohm replied with a smile.The word 'home' brought a warm feeling in his chest. He liked it. He liked it more that, the word also meant that he could stay with Nanon.Not that he was accepting the fact that he was married to Nanon, but that he didn't completely dislike the idea. He felt that if he had to marry a man someday, the best option would be none other than Nanon himself.Perth wasn't lying when he said that Ohm didn't hate Nanon as much as he claimed to. He didn't hate Nanon at all.¬†'Hate' was always the wrong word, the right one being 'mad'. He was mad at Nanon and everyone else around him. But more at Nanon as the latter used to be the person he always believed to know him better than anyone else.All he wanted for Nanon was an apology. He wanted Nanon to own up to his mistakes and apologise, and then he would leave everything in the past and have a new start in their friendship.He wasn't being big-hearted or egoistic. He was willing to apologise as well. But Nanon had to apologise to him first.The elevator door dinged open. Ohm and Ui stepped in and pressed the respective floors.Ohm leaned against the elevator wall and his mind flew back to the past.Ohm had been friends with Nanon since they were in kinder garden. He was really possessive of the little friend of his. His friend's dimpled smile had always been his weakness.He wasn't particularly happy when Nanon brought Chimon into their friendship. But when he saw how happy Nanon was with Chimon being with them, he let the matter rest.Like every group of three, Chimon and Nanon started becoming closer and Ohm started feeling left out. He rarely got chances to play alone with Nanon.This was exactly why he always brought Perth along with him to play. Perth was very useful in taking Chimon's attention away and he got Nanon for himself.Everything was going well until they were in middle school. Their friendship was strong and even his bond with Chimon had developed well.That was when a compulsory parent-child event was held in their school.Ohm was eccentric about it as it would be the first time his parents would be meeting Nanon's. Nanon had once told him that Chimon's parents were close to his parents which made him and Chimon become close friends.Ohm too wanted something similar. He hoped that his parents would become friends with Nanon's parents just like Chimon's parents.But there was an unexpected turn of events when the two pairs of parents met. Nanon's family turned out to be his family's mortal enemies.¬†Ohm was dragged back home from the event by his parents.Nobody knew how much that discovery had hurt Ohm. Ever since that day, his grandfather who never said no to him, restricted him from being friends with Nanon. The restrictions developed to the extent that his grandfather even had someone watch over him so that he would never interact with Nanon.In order to pacify his grandfather, he decided to keep a distance from Nanon for the time being. At least till his grandfather lowers his guard and withdraws the people appointed to watch him.Those days when he saw Nanon's effort to retain their friendship, he was over the moon. Even though he couldn't reciprocate those efforts under the watchful eyes of his grandfather's men, he was deeply touched by it.As days flew by he started getting the feeling that he wasn't getting to see Nanon more often. He got the feeling that Nanon was no longer applying himself as he used to.He got the news that Nanon had publically confessed to a girl named Film.The news hurt him more than it should. He was so hurt by the fact that Nanon never mentioned to him about his crush on that girl.There were times when Ohm asked Nanon if there was any girl he was interested in and the latter would always say that he didn't.Yet, Nanon had gone ahead and confessed his feelings for the girl, that too in front of so many students.Having to find out about his best friend's crush from others made him feel really sad. He was upset that Nanon didn't even think about telling him about it.He got curious about the girl who managed to win his best friend's heart as the dimpled guy had rarely shown any interest in girls as far as he could remember.¬†When he first saw Film, she was talking behind Nanon's back, bad-mouthing him and even calling him a fool.Ohm was completely enraged by that. He couldn't believe that his friend had fallen for such a girl.¬†He went ahead and confronted her without delay.Film admitted to him that she felt that Nanon was a fool to have confessed to her in front of everyone. She said that she disliked him because he was pestering Ohm like a lovestruck puppy and now had changed targets towards her as Ohm didn't give him any attention.Ohm frowned upon hearing that. He did hear rumours circulating in the school saying that there was something going on between him and Nanon, but he seriously didn't care. In fact, he liked it when people took his name along with Nanon's.He wasn't expecting that those rumours would affect his friend's first love to this extent.He tried explaining to Film but she told him that she had been in love with him for so long. The revelation caught him off guard.¬†Even before he could do or say something, Film had kissed him on the lips. He froze up when he saw that Nanon had witnessed the scene.¬†The next thing that happened was way beyond his expectations, Nanon pulled him apart from Film and punched him.His best friend punched him, that too for a girl.He got so hurt by the action that he pushed Nanon away in anger. He wasn't expecting Nanon to fall down the stairs.Ohm wanted to rush forward towards Nanon but all he could see was hatred and disgust emitting from Nanon's eyes.Those eyes hurt him more than the punch he received."}

As I disembarked near the school town, the sight unveiled a realm of possibilities, each step echoing the magnitude of the uncharted path ahead.Stepping off near the school town made me feel like I was getting closer to something important, even if I didn't know exactly what yet.Each step I took into its hallowed halls across the new school carried the weight of my family's aspirations, resonating with Ma's earnest plea: \"Make us proud, Minho.\"In the head principal's office, his words offered both reassurance and a forewarning of the trials ahead .He already knew my name from the scholarship application, making me feel both eager and a bit nervous about the expectations ahead¬†Principal: \"You're embarking on a new chapter, Minho. Make the most of it.\"¬†Minho: \"I'll do my best, sir. My family's counting on me.\"Principal: \"Believe in your potential. This school has much to offer.\"Minho: \"I'll make them proud, sir. Thank you for the opportunity.\"he assured, with a nod that carried the weight of a mentor's wisdom.Stepping outside the school building, the rush of unfamiliar faces and bustling corridors surrounded me. Amidst the chaos, my gaze wandered to the boarding house's rooftop. \"Huh, who's that?\" I murmured to myself, a flicker of curiosity briefly igniting within the overwhelming newness of the moment.Navigating my way to the boarding house, Auntie awaited with open arms, her eyes exuding warmth and solace.¬†\"Thank you, Auntie, for welcoming me,\"I expressed gratitude, finding unexpected comfort in her motherly demeanor.there are two buildings attached but separated as girls and boysteher eare about 3 rooms,in each there are 2 students (all are from the same school)I met my roommate sang se\"hi,am i in the right place\"as a silly extrovert shit I introduced my self in the most worst way.\"Hey, tidy up your things and grab the broom from the rooftop, will you?\"\"sure\"The evening cast a warm glow over the BOARDING HOUSE as I headed to the rooftop to grab a forgotten broom to clean the room that arranged to sleep. breaking the peaceful silence...¬†I slipped on a wet patch and felt a jolt as I hit the ground.¬† \"Ouch!\" I winced, surprised by my clumsiness.(aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah)Frustrated, I found myself shouting at the sky, asking the universe why things had to be this absurd.Looking up, I caught her eye, ¬†SOO JIThe girl exuded an air of indifference, as if nothing could sway or capture her attention.but she seemed unfazed, as if nothing in the world mattered to her. Her nonchalant attitude echoed Auntie's words,¬†\"This place is more than walls, Minho. It's a home away from home.\"Feeling overwhelmed, I'm lost in a whirlwind of thoughts, caught up in a maze of worries and uncertainties.hiiicomment down and vote for the next episodee!"}

Maybe next year you'll finally get it right."}

The memories of our encounter flooded my mind, but now, in the harsh light of reality, I felt a mix of confusion and anger. How could I have been so reckless? And why did he show up at my party?I shook off my daze and composed myself, realizing that I couldn't let anyone see the turmoil inside me. Taking a deep breath, I straightened my posture and looked at him with a forced smile.\"Thank you for your help,\" I said, trying to sound as composed as possible. He just smiled and said \" Lagta hai hamare zindagi bhi aapse ulaz chuki hai\"\"Looks like my life has been entangled with you as well\"And left.As he disappeared into the crowd, I couldn't help but wonder about the connection between us. Why did our paths cross again? And what did it mean for my already complicated life?Over the next few days, I couldn't get him out of my mind. I found myself replaying our night together, trying to understand why it had affected me so deeply. His touch, his scent, everything about him lingered in my thoughts.Unable to focus on my work, I decided to take a break and clear my head. I found myself walking towards the bar where we had first met. The place held a strange allure, as if it held the answers to my questions.Entering the dimly lit establishment, I took a seat at the same spot where we had shared our night of passion. The memories flooded back, and I couldn't help but feel a mix of longing and regret.\"Another drink, ma'am?\" the bartender asked, interrupting my thoughts.I nodded, needing something to numb the confusion inside me. As I sipped on my drink, I noticed the bartender stealing glances at me. There was something about him that seemed familiar, but I couldn't put my finger on it.It suddenly striked me that it was him! My alluring one night stand.I couldn't move from my place nor my eyes turned away from him, but my heart was beating so fast that even he can hear it.All the scenes from that night keeps flashing infront of my eyes as my cheeks flushed.You aren't even drunk till now ma'am and your cheeks are already red.He said bending next to me whispering these words.It's all your affect....I whispered back which left me stunned as well.Looks like you remember everything about that night princessHe said.I just nod gulping my saliva while looking in his eyes.There was an electrifying connection between us which we both were understanding but none of us were going to give in until the other was going to beg that's for sure."}
