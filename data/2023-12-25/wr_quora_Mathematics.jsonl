This company found that 45% of people’s genes benefit from a high carb diet, 47% from moderate and only 8% on low.\n\nYour DNA can also tell you things like if you are sensitive to lactose, gluten, and caffeine, your optimal protein intake, and which foods are healthiest for you.

Subtract 102 from both sides of the equation:\n\n$10^x + x - 102 = 0$\n\nStep 2: We cannot solve this equation algebraically, so we need to use numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method.\n\nStep 3: Choose an initial value of x as a starting point for the numerical method. Let's choose $x_0 = 2$.\n\nStep 4: Apply the Newton-Raphson method. We iterate using the following formula:\n\n$x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$\n\nFor our equation, the function f(x) is $10^x + x - 102$ and its derivative f'(x) is $10^x \\ln(10) + 1$.\n\nUsing $x_0 = 2$ in the formula, we have:\n\n$x_1 = 2 - \\frac{10^2 + 2 - 102}{10^2 \\ln(10) + 1} \\approx 2.116686$\n\nStep 5: Repeat the iteration process until the desired level of accuracy is reached. Continuing the iteration process, we find:\n\n$x_2 \\approx 2.146095$\n\n$x_3 \\approx 2.146193$\n\n$x_4 \\approx 2.146193$\n\nStep 6: The value of x that approximately satisfies the equation $10^x + x = 102$ is $x \\approx 2.146193$."}

In fact, this equation only holds when a=b=1, which is a trivial case. For any other values of a and b, the equation is false.\n\nTo see why, let’s use the \nproduct rule\n of logarithms, which states that log(ab)=log(a)+log(b) for any positive a and b1\n. If we apply this rule to the left-hand side of the equation, we get:\n\nlog(a+b)=log((a+b)1)=log(a+b)+log(1)\n\nBut log(1)=0, so we can simplify this to:\n\nlog(a+b)=log(a+b)\n\nThis means that the equation is equivalent to:\n\nlog(a+b)=log(a+b)+log(a)\n\nBut this is only true when log(a)=0, which implies that a=1. Similarly, if we subtract log(b) from both sides, we get:\n\nlog(a+b)-log(b)=log(a)\n\nBut this is only true when log(b)=0, which implies that b=1. Therefore, the equation is only true when a=b=1, and false otherwise."}
