We show the superior ability of such an optimization-based approach in removing reconstruction\nartifacts compared to existing phase retrieval and lattice distortion reconstruction approaches.\n1 Introduction\nBragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) is a valuable tool to spatially resolve the lattice strain in crystalline\nmaterials at the scale of ∼10 nmby using coherent x-rays as a probe [1, 2, 3]. Bragg ptychography, the scanning\nvariant of BCDI, is used for extended crystalline samples larger than the beam size [4, 5, 6]. Both techniques have\nbeen applied to a variety of materials science problems, such as the performance of batteries [7, 8, 9], catalytic\nphenomena at metal interfaces [10, 11, 12, 13], and characterization of quantum sensors [14]. These conventional\nBCDI methods enable the spatial resolution of a single component of the three-component elastic lattice distortion\nfield. This component corresponds to the Bragg diffraction vector of momentum transfer that comes about via a\nspecific orientation of the single crystal lattice of the sample with respect to the beam (one of the crystal’s Bragg\nconditions). Reorienting the crystal into other configurations with respect to the incident x-ray probe permits the\nindependent components of the lattice distortion to be imaged. When three or more independent Bragg conditions\ncan be satisfied and measured with BCDI, it is possible to unambiguously resolve the lattice displacement vector\nfield within the sample.\nRecent efforts to simultaneously reconstruct all components of internal lattice distortion fields with BCDI have\nshown promising results with simulations [15, 16] as well as experiments [17, 18] The experimental works have\nemployed different combinations of well-known fixed point iterative projection algorithms [19], typically in parallel\nreconstruction threads. The solutions of these parallel reconstructions are analyzed for desirable properties in order\nto seed the next generation of randomized solutions ( i.e., the ‘guided’ approach using genetic algorithms [20]). All\nthe vector field reconstruction demonstrations referenced above explicitly minimize the discrepancy between the bulk\ndistortion field and the computed phase from conventional phase retrieval. A recent alternate approach seeks to\ndirectly and simultaneously minimize the discrepancy in the measured and estimated coherent diffraction signals in\n1arXiv:2312.14907v1  [cond-mat.mtrl-sci]  22 Dec 2023an all-encompassing gradient descent optimization scheme [21].

We show the integration of the permutation symmetry\nas the most restrictive discrete symmetry into quantum circuits. The permutation symmetry is the\nsupergroup of all other discrete groups. We identify the permutation with a SWAP operation on\nthe qubits. Based on the extension of the symmetry into the corresponding Lie algebra, quantum\ncircuit element construction is shown via exponentiation. This allows for ready integration of the\npermutation group symmetry into quantum circuit ansatzes. The scaling of the number of parame-\nters is found to be O(n3), significantly lower than the general case and an indication that symmetry\nrestricts the applicability of quantum computing. We also show how to adapt existing circuits to\nbe invariant under a permutation symmetry by modification.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe mathematical study of group symmetries has\nproven to be one of the most successful tools in mathe-\nmatical physics. From the development of quantum chro-\nmodynamics [1] from SU(3) symmetries to the discovery\nof exact solutions to Einstein’s equations from their re-\nspective isometry groups [2] and advancements in string\ntheory from duality symmetries [3], there exist many in-\nstances in physics where the study of the symmetries of a\nproblem led to its resolution or even to the development\nof an entirely new theory.\nGroup theory has developed out of the consideration\nof physical symmetries and provides an accurate descrip-\ntion of the behaviour of the system under symmetry op-\nerations [4]. In particular, it gives a notion of systems\nthat do not change under a symmetry operation and thus\nare symmetry-invariant. Computational problems from\nother fields of science can similarly utilize the descrip-\ntion of symmetry operations to simplify the problem and\nreduce the solution space [5].\nThe consideration of symmetries is in general indepen-\ndent of the computational method. For classical com-\nputers, an appropriate design of the computational al-\ngorithm allows to capture the underlying symmetry of\nthe solution to be found. On quantum computers, the\ndiscrete symmetry can be integrated into the quantum\ncircuit [6, 7]. Quantum computers are structurally ben-\neficial for the study of quantum systems [8] and as such\nneed to be able to capture symmetries within the system\nof study.\nFor a study of a physical system, it is often helpful\nto look at the extremes first. Quantum circuit construc-\ntion in the absence of external symmetries is possible,\nboth towards a known target [9] and also with a quan-\ntum machine learning ansatz [10]. On the other end,\nthe permutation symmetry acts as the supergroup of all\nother discrete symmetries. In the quantum computing\n∗maximilian-balthasar.mansky@ifi.lmu.decase, this can be realized with the requirement that all\nqubits are interchangeable with all other qubits. This as-\nsumes that the smallest unit of information processed in\nthe system is a single qubit. It is also possible to require\nlarger blocks of qubits representing a block of information\nto be interchangeable, or consider the interchangeability\nof logical qubits [11].\nBy embedding the physical problem in the description\nof the quantum computer, one also imparts additional\nknowledge on the system. There is always a trade-off be-\ntween generalization and specialization of systems [12].\nThis is also true for implementing symmetries on a com-\nputational problem, as the solution is then inherently\nlimited to that symmetry-respecting subspace of the total\nsolution space. In the case where the implemented sym-\nmetry does not correspond to the factual symmetry of\nthe problem, the solution can only be approximative. On\nthe other hand, if the factual symmetry is correctly im-\nplemented, the lower number of parameters should lead\nto a faster convergence. In the context of quantum com-\nputing, the symmetry restricts the size of the available\nHilbert space [13].\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. After\nan overview of prior and related work, we first intro-\nduce the mathematical fundamentals and show that a\npermutation-invariant circuit is well-defined, in terms of\nits group structure and corresponding Lie algebra, and\nhas the necessary structure for quantum computing. A\nconstructive approach for permutation invariant circuits\nis introduced in section IV and the scaling of the num-\nber of parameters is analyzed in section V. We close by\nshowing how existing circuits can be modified to capture\na permutation and symmetry and a discussion of our re-\nsults.\nII.

They\nhave therefore drawn extensive experimental and theoretical attention in the recent decades. The latest mea-\nsurements of the Drell-Yan processes have been carried out by the ATLAS [1–4], CMS [5–9] and LHCb [10]\ncollaborations at the LHC at colliding energies of√s= 7, 8, and 13 TeV, as well as the CDF and DØ\ncollaborations at√s= 1.96 TeV at the Tevatron [11–14].

Approaches includes numerical relativity, and\nrelevant to the current work, simplifying analytic lim-\nits, such as point-like approximations, dressed with an\ninﬁnite set of eﬀective couplings that control multipole\nmoment, tidal parameters and other degrees of freedom.\nBlack holes (BHs) are special in that they are known to\npossess a remarkably simplicity, which may transpire to\nmaking computations easier. The simplicity is rooted in\nthe familiar no-hair theorem, which states that a macro-\nscopic black hole may be characterized entirely by its\nmass, angular momentum, and electric charge, where the\nlatter can be neglected for astrophysical black holes.\nThegravitationaldynamicsofarotatingBHmustthus\nbe parameterized by its mass m(or momentum pµin\na generic frame) and spin Sµ=maµ, where the latter\nvariable is a transverse vector p·a= 0 with units of\nlengths, corresponding to the Kerr-metric [1] ring singu-\nlarity of radius |a|:=√\n−a2. In the eﬀective worldline\napproach[2–6](see alsorecentwork[7–10]), the BHspin-\nmultipole interactions linear in the Riemann tensor have\nsimple combinatorial coupling coeﬃcients. These coeﬃ-\ncients originate from the exponential structure of these\ncouplings [11] due to the Newman-Janis shift relation-\nship [12] between the Kerr and Schwarzschild solutions.\nScattering amplitudes have recently emerged as an ef-\nﬁcient way to encode black-hole dynamics [13–40].

INTRODUCTION\nFuzzy dark matter (FDM) has lately emerged as a\npopular alternative to the conventional cold dark mat-\nter (CDM) model. Following the ﬁrst proposition of an\nultralight bosonic dark matter constituent [ 1], an ultra-\nlight particle within the mass range 10−22−10−20eV,\nleads to a description based not on incoherent particles,\nbut on a single coherent wavefunction, with a de Broglie\nwavelength of ∼ O(1) kpc. Numerical simulations [ 2–\n4] have shown that on large scales, FDM replicates the\ncosmic web structure ofcold dark matter, whilst address-\ning some alleged challenges that CDM faces on galactic\nscales. Formationandgrowthofstructuresinsuchadark\nmatter background has been thoroughly investigated re-\ncently [5–8]. The favourable look upon this type of dark\nmatterinrecentyearshasbeenmotivatedbytheinherent\nproperties which remedy ailments from which the CDM\nmodel allegedly suﬀers [ 9–11]. Among these, most no-\ntably, is the cusp-core problem [ 12] which is resolved in\nFDM since the balance between the quantum pressure\nand gravitation in FDM naturally forms a core, embed-\nded in a NFW-like halo [ 13]. Furthermore, some tenta-\ntive, more direct favourable evidence for FDM may have\nbegun to emerge, see e.g.[14]. Scrutiny of this model has\nbecome an active area of research - see e.g.[15–17] for\nrecent reviews and references to the literature.\nThe cores in FDM halos, often termed FDM solitons,\nexhibit interesting dynamical behaviours. Given non-\nsymmetricinitialconditions, thecoresformedfromgravi-\ntationalcollapseexhibitarandomwalkwithinthebaseof\nthe gravitational potential [ 18,19]. Furthermore, scalar\nﬁeld oscillations are observed in numerical simulations\n[2,3,18–23], and signiﬁcant advances have been made\nin understanding the parameter dependence of their fre-\nquency [24,25].

Higher excited\nasymmetric states are also possible but they will not\nbe discussed in this paper. In such non-symmetrically\ninitialised simulations, the constructive interference of\ndensity waves and further stochastic density ﬂuctuations\n[26,27] also generate granules with a typical scale of the\norder of the central soliton core [ 2,3,28].

Avdeev∗and M.O. Nestoklon\nIoffe Institute, 194021 St. Petersburg, Russia\nWe put forward a generalized procedure is which allows to restore the bulk-like electron and\nhole wave functions from the wave functions of quantum confined electron/hole states obtained in\natomistic calculations. The procedure is applied to the lead chalcogenide quantum dots and the\neffective Hamiltonian of the exchange interaction for the ground state of an exciton localized in\nPbS and PbSe quantum dots was extracted. The results demonstrate that the matrix elements of\nintravalley exchange in PbS quantum dots are much more anisotropic than ones in PbSe.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nCurrently, semiconductor-based nanostructures are\nwidely used for various applications. In particular, quan-\ntum dots (QDs) [1] offer the tunability of various prop-\nerties from the basic ones like effective band gap to more\ncomplicated as exchange interaction in excitons[2] and\ncarrier g-factor values [3, 4]. Rapid progress of experi-\nmental techniques demands for the detailed theoretical\ninsight into properties of semiconductor nanostructures.\nHowever, until now there is a gap between purely phe-\nnomenological methods based on k·pcalculations [5, 6]\nand atomistic calculations, both empirical [7, 8] and ab\ninitio [9, 10]. For the band structure calculations, the in-\nterpretation of the atomistic results within the k·pframe-\nwork is straightforward. For nanostructure calculations,\nhowever, in most cases an additional work is to be done.\nIn current work we propose the solution of probably\none of the most complex tasks in the analysis of atomistic\ncalculations results: the general method to restore the\nbulk-like wave functions from the wave functions of quan-\ntum confined carriers in quantum dots grown from the\nmultivalley semiconductors. To demonstrate the practi-\ncal use of the developed method, we consider the problem\nof fine structure of exciton in lead chalcogenide quantum\ndots [11, 12] and extract the parameters of effective k·p-\nlike Hamiltonian directly from the atomistic calculations.\nLead chalcogenides Pb X,X= S,Se are narrow direct\nband gap semiconductors suitable for infrared optoelec-\ntronics due to the tunability of the band gap in a wide\nrange of the infrared spectrum. Under normal conditions\nthey have the rock-salt crystal structure with O5\nhspace\ngroup. They have complex band structure: The conduc-\ntion and valence band extrema are located at the four\ninequivalent anisotropic Lvalleys. Lead chalcogenide-\nbased nanostructures are promising for a wide range of\napplications in infrared optoelectronics and photovoltaics\n[13–15].\nThe theoretical modelling of lead chalcogenide-based\nnanostructures is challenging due to their complex mul-\ntivalley band structure. As a result of quantum confine-\nment, different valleys are mixing and the wave functions\n∗ivan.avdeev@mail.ioffe.ruof the carriers are combinations of the valley states [11].\nIn particular, this leads to the complicated fine structure\nof the excitons caused by interaction of spin-orbit, valley\nand exchange splitting [12]. This also results in com-\nplex behaviour of carriers’ g-factors [3] and other effects.\nThe valley mixing of states significantly complicates the\nmapping of atomistic calculations onto the analytical k·p\nmodel, where such microscopic effects can only be ac-\ncounted phenomenologically.\nThe aim of the present paper is to establish a direct\nrelation between the band edge states at Lvalleys and\nquantum confined states in PbX QDs in empirical tight-\nbinding method (ETB). For this purpose, we develop a\nnumerically stable and robust procedure which allows us\nto unwind the valley structure of electron (hole) states\nin QDs of multivalley semiconductor. The method is\nbased on symmetry analysis, symmetrization technique\nand Fourier transform of the electron (hole) states. The\nprocedure enables direct mapping of the atomistic tight-\nbinding calculations onto the extended k·ptheory.\nTo show the capabilities of the developed procedure we\nuse it to calculate the intravalley interband momentum\nmatrix elements and intravalley anisotropic long range\nexchange constants in cubic, cuboctahedral and octahe-\ndral PbX, X=S,Se quantum dots with tetragonal symme-\ntry, similar to the ones studied in Ref. [12]. We demon-\nstrate that these intravalley quantities almost insensitive\nto the shape of the quantum dot and agree very well\nwith effective mass calculations. Direct access to the val-\nley states allows us to show that velocity and exchange\nCoulomb matrix elements in PbS quantum dots are much\nmore anisotropic than in PbSe in the considered range of\nquantum dot diameters from 3 nm to 25 nm.\nII.

The1\n2-BPS\noperators in the free theory are arbitrary holomorphic functions of one of the matrix-valued\ncomplex scalars of the SYM theory with R= 1. The ring of such functions is generated\nfreely by the first Npowers of the matrix, and the index is therefore given by\nIN(q) =1\n(q)N(1.2)\n– 1 –in terms of the q-Pochhammer symbol ( q)n:=Qn\nj=1(1−qj). A well-known mathematical\nresult (see Appendix A for a derivation) is that this index can be rewritten as follows\nIN(q) = I∞(q)∞X\nm=0(−1)mqm(m+1)/2\n(q)mqmN.

Family Puzzle\nThe 3 families or 3 generations of quarks and leptons of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics had been\nadvocated since the 1970s [1]. The Family Puzzle or Generation Problem demands an explanation of what dictates the\nSM family number Nf= 3. Any valid theoretical solution to this puzzle, unraveling the SM’s underlying mysterious\nstructure, can guide us further to explore Beyond the Standard Model physics (BSM) with elevated confidence, making\nnew predictions. What is the evidence of Nf= 3?\nOn one hand, in the quark sector, the (C)KM matrix indicates that the charge-conjugation-parity CP symmetry\nviolation of quarks via the weak interaction predicts the existence of at least 3 families of quarks in nature theoretically\n[2]. The discovery of the most massive known elementary particle, top quark t, in 1995 by the CDF and Dø experiments\nat the Fermilab [3, 4] confirmed the completion of 3 families of quarks experimentally. Moreover, if there is any gapped\nhypothetical 4th generation of quarks massive than tquark, say t′andb′quarks, the Higgs decay rate to two gluons\nϕH→ggthrough loop triangle Feynman diagrams of 3 types of virtual massive quarks ( t, t′, b′) will be enhanced by\na factor of 32= 9 times larger than the SM prediction, but which possibility has been excluded [5].\nOn the other hand, in the lepton sector, the Zboson (the third most massive known particle of about 91 GeV)\ndecays into at most 3 families of light neutrinos (assuming light neutrinos are lighter than about 45 GeV, namely\nmass mν< m Z/2), verified at CERN’s Large Electron Positron Collider (LEP) [6, 7]. In addition, the astrophysical\ndata from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) or big bang nucleosythesis (BBN) also suggest 3 families of light\nneutrinos [8].\nHere we show a novel theoretical solution to the Family Puzzle — the multiple of Nf= 3 of 16 Weyl fermions\nin the 3+1d spacetime dimensions are robust due to the almost purely topological constraints (without requiring\ninternal symmetry, neither global symmetry nor gauge structure) rooted in the profound mathematics and derivable\nin physics.1\nB.

We show the superior ability of such an optimization-based approach in removing reconstruction\nartifacts compared to existing phase retrieval and lattice distortion reconstruction approaches.\n1 Introduction\nBragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) is a valuable tool to spatially resolve the lattice strain in crystalline\nmaterials at the scale of ∼10 nmby using coherent x-rays as a probe [1, 2, 3]. Bragg ptychography, the scanning\nvariant of BCDI, is used for extended crystalline samples larger than the beam size [4, 5, 6]. Both techniques have\nbeen applied to a variety of materials science problems, such as the performance of batteries [7, 8, 9], catalytic\nphenomena at metal interfaces [10, 11, 12, 13], and characterization of quantum sensors [14]. These conventional\nBCDI methods enable the spatial resolution of a single component of the three-component elastic lattice distortion\nfield. This component corresponds to the Bragg diffraction vector of momentum transfer that comes about via a\nspecific orientation of the single crystal lattice of the sample with respect to the beam (one of the crystal’s Bragg\nconditions). Reorienting the crystal into other configurations with respect to the incident x-ray probe permits the\nindependent components of the lattice distortion to be imaged. When three or more independent Bragg conditions\ncan be satisfied and measured with BCDI, it is possible to unambiguously resolve the lattice displacement vector\nfield within the sample.\nRecent efforts to simultaneously reconstruct all components of internal lattice distortion fields with BCDI have\nshown promising results with simulations [15, 16] as well as experiments [17, 18] The experimental works have\nemployed different combinations of well-known fixed point iterative projection algorithms [19], typically in parallel\nreconstruction threads. The solutions of these parallel reconstructions are analyzed for desirable properties in order\nto seed the next generation of randomized solutions ( i.e., the ‘guided’ approach using genetic algorithms [20]). All\nthe vector field reconstruction demonstrations referenced above explicitly minimize the discrepancy between the bulk\ndistortion field and the computed phase from conventional phase retrieval. A recent alternate approach seeks to\ndirectly and simultaneously minimize the discrepancy in the measured and estimated coherent diffraction signals in\n1arXiv:2312.14907v1  [cond-mat.mtrl-sci]  22 Dec 2023an all-encompassing gradient descent optimization scheme [21].

We also show how to adapt existing circuits to\nbe invariant under a permutation symmetry by modification.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe mathematical study of group symmetries has\nproven to be one of the most successful tools in mathe-\nmatical physics. From the development of quantum chro-\nmodynamics [1] from SU(3) symmetries to the discovery\nof exact solutions to Einstein’s equations from their re-\nspective isometry groups [2] and advancements in string\ntheory from duality symmetries [3], there exist many in-\nstances in physics where the study of the symmetries of a\nproblem led to its resolution or even to the development\nof an entirely new theory.\nGroup theory has developed out of the consideration\nof physical symmetries and provides an accurate descrip-\ntion of the behaviour of the system under symmetry op-\nerations [4]. In particular, it gives a notion of systems\nthat do not change under a symmetry operation and thus\nare symmetry-invariant. Computational problems from\nother fields of science can similarly utilize the descrip-\ntion of symmetry operations to simplify the problem and\nreduce the solution space [5].\nThe consideration of symmetries is in general indepen-\ndent of the computational method. For classical com-\nputers, an appropriate design of the computational al-\ngorithm allows to capture the underlying symmetry of\nthe solution to be found. On quantum computers, the\ndiscrete symmetry can be integrated into the quantum\ncircuit [6, 7]. Quantum computers are structurally ben-\neficial for the study of quantum systems [8] and as such\nneed to be able to capture symmetries within the system\nof study.\nFor a study of a physical system, it is often helpful\nto look at the extremes first. Quantum circuit construc-\ntion in the absence of external symmetries is possible,\nboth towards a known target [9] and also with a quan-\ntum machine learning ansatz [10]. On the other end,\nthe permutation symmetry acts as the supergroup of all\nother discrete symmetries. In the quantum computing\n∗maximilian-balthasar.mansky@ifi.lmu.decase, this can be realized with the requirement that all\nqubits are interchangeable with all other qubits. This as-\nsumes that the smallest unit of information processed in\nthe system is a single qubit. It is also possible to require\nlarger blocks of qubits representing a block of information\nto be interchangeable, or consider the interchangeability\nof logical qubits [11].\nBy embedding the physical problem in the description\nof the quantum computer, one also imparts additional\nknowledge on the system. There is always a trade-off be-\ntween generalization and specialization of systems [12].\nThis is also true for implementing symmetries on a com-\nputational problem, as the solution is then inherently\nlimited to that symmetry-respecting subspace of the total\nsolution space. In the case where the implemented sym-\nmetry does not correspond to the factual symmetry of\nthe problem, the solution can only be approximative. On\nthe other hand, if the factual symmetry is correctly im-\nplemented, the lower number of parameters should lead\nto a faster convergence.

Approaches includes numerical relativity, and\nrelevant to the current work, simplifying analytic lim-\nits, such as point-like approximations, dressed with an\ninﬁnite set of eﬀective couplings that control multipole\nmoment, tidal parameters and other degrees of freedom.\nBlack holes (BHs) are special in that they are known to\npossess a remarkably simplicity, which may transpire to\nmaking computations easier.

In the eﬀective worldline\napproach[2–6](see alsorecentwork[7–10]), the BHspin-\nmultipole interactions linear in the Riemann tensor have\nsimple combinatorial coupling coeﬃcients. These coeﬃ-\ncients originate from the exponential structure of these\ncouplings [11] due to the Newman-Janis shift relation-\nship [12] between the Kerr and Schwarzschild solutions.\nScattering amplitudes have recently emerged as an ef-\nﬁcient way to encode black-hole dynamics [13–40].

Molecular organic semiconductors are\na technologically very interesting class of materials with\na distinctive charge transport physics [1].

The\ntransfer integrals between these localised orbitals un-\ndergo large thermal fluctuations, similar in magnitude to\nthe transfer integrals themselves, producing a dynamic\ndisorder that ultimately determines the charge carrier\nmobility [2–12]. This qualitative picture can be read-\nily translated into semiclassical models such as Ehren-\nfest [13] or surface hopping [6, 7, 9] where the nuclei are\ntreated classically but the approximate nature of this ap-\nproach prevents the study of the low temperature limit\nanddoesnotallowacleardistinctionbetweennovelphys-\nics and artefacts of the model.

INTRODUCTION\nFuzzy dark matter (FDM) has lately emerged as a\npopular alternative to the conventional cold dark mat-\nter (CDM) model. Following the ﬁrst proposition of an\nultralight bosonic dark matter constituent [ 1], an ultra-\nlight particle within the mass range 10−22−10−20eV,\nleads to a description based not on incoherent particles,\nbut on a single coherent wavefunction, with a de Broglie\nwavelength of ∼ O(1) kpc. Numerical simulations [ 2–\n4] have shown that on large scales, FDM replicates the\ncosmic web structure ofcold dark matter, whilst address-\ning some alleged challenges that CDM faces on galactic\nscales.

The favourable look upon this type of dark\nmatterinrecentyearshasbeenmotivatedbytheinherent\nproperties which remedy ailments from which the CDM\nmodel allegedly suﬀers [ 9–11]. Among these, most no-\ntably, is the cusp-core problem [ 12] which is resolved in\nFDM since the balance between the quantum pressure\nand gravitation in FDM naturally forms a core, embed-\nded in a NFW-like halo [ 13]. Furthermore, some tenta-\ntive, more direct favourable evidence for FDM may have\nbegun to emerge, see e.g.[14]. Scrutiny of this model has\nbecome an active area of research - see e.g.[15–17] for\nrecent reviews and references to the literature.\nThe cores in FDM halos, often termed FDM solitons,\nexhibit interesting dynamical behaviours. Given non-\nsymmetricinitialconditions, thecoresformedfromgravi-\ntationalcollapseexhibitarandomwalkwithinthebaseof\nthe gravitational potential [ 18,19]. Furthermore, scalar\nﬁeld oscillations are observed in numerical simulations\n[2,3,18–23], and signiﬁcant advances have been made\nin understanding the parameter dependence of their fre-\nquency [24,25].

In such non-symmetrically\ninitialised simulations, the constructive interference of\ndensity waves and further stochastic density ﬂuctuations\n[26,27] also generate granules with a typical scale of the\norder of the central soliton core [ 2,3,28].

Avdeev∗and M.O. Nestoklon\nIoffe Institute, 194021 St. Petersburg, Russia\nWe put forward a generalized procedure is which allows to restore the bulk-like electron and\nhole wave functions from the wave functions of quantum confined electron/hole states obtained in\natomistic calculations. The procedure is applied to the lead chalcogenide quantum dots and the\neffective Hamiltonian of the exchange interaction for the ground state of an exciton localized in\nPbS and PbSe quantum dots was extracted. The results demonstrate that the matrix elements of\nintravalley exchange in PbS quantum dots are much more anisotropic than ones in PbSe.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nCurrently, semiconductor-based nanostructures are\nwidely used for various applications. In particular, quan-\ntum dots (QDs) [1] offer the tunability of various prop-\nerties from the basic ones like effective band gap to more\ncomplicated as exchange interaction in excitons[2] and\ncarrier g-factor values [3, 4]. Rapid progress of experi-\nmental techniques demands for the detailed theoretical\ninsight into properties of semiconductor nanostructures.\nHowever, until now there is a gap between purely phe-\nnomenological methods based on k·pcalculations [5, 6]\nand atomistic calculations, both empirical [7, 8] and ab\ninitio [9, 10]. For the band structure calculations, the in-\nterpretation of the atomistic results within the k·pframe-\nwork is straightforward. For nanostructure calculations,\nhowever, in most cases an additional work is to be done.\nIn current work we propose the solution of probably\none of the most complex tasks in the analysis of atomistic\ncalculations results: the general method to restore the\nbulk-like wave functions from the wave functions of quan-\ntum confined carriers in quantum dots grown from the\nmultivalley semiconductors. To demonstrate the practi-\ncal use of the developed method, we consider the problem\nof fine structure of exciton in lead chalcogenide quantum\ndots [11, 12] and extract the parameters of effective k·p-\nlike Hamiltonian directly from the atomistic calculations.\nLead chalcogenides Pb X,X= S,Se are narrow direct\nband gap semiconductors suitable for infrared optoelec-\ntronics due to the tunability of the band gap in a wide\nrange of the infrared spectrum. Under normal conditions\nthey have the rock-salt crystal structure with O5\nhspace\ngroup. They have complex band structure: The conduc-\ntion and valence band extrema are located at the four\ninequivalent anisotropic Lvalleys. Lead chalcogenide-\nbased nanostructures are promising for a wide range of\napplications in infrared optoelectronics and photovoltaics\n[13–15].\nThe theoretical modelling of lead chalcogenide-based\nnanostructures is challenging due to their complex mul-\ntivalley band structure. As a result of quantum confine-\nment, different valleys are mixing and the wave functions\n∗ivan.avdeev@mail.ioffe.ruof the carriers are combinations of the valley states [11].\nIn particular, this leads to the complicated fine structure\nof the excitons caused by interaction of spin-orbit, valley\nand exchange splitting [12]. This also results in com-\nplex behaviour of carriers’ g-factors [3] and other effects.\nThe valley mixing of states significantly complicates the\nmapping of atomistic calculations onto the analytical k·p\nmodel, where such microscopic effects can only be ac-\ncounted phenomenologically.\nThe aim of the present paper is to establish a direct\nrelation between the band edge states at Lvalleys and\nquantum confined states in PbX QDs in empirical tight-\nbinding method (ETB). For this purpose, we develop a\nnumerically stable and robust procedure which allows us\nto unwind the valley structure of electron (hole) states\nin QDs of multivalley semiconductor. The method is\nbased on symmetry analysis, symmetrization technique\nand Fourier transform of the electron (hole) states. The\nprocedure enables direct mapping of the atomistic tight-\nbinding calculations onto the extended k·ptheory.\nTo show the capabilities of the developed procedure we\nuse it to calculate the intravalley interband momentum\nmatrix elements and intravalley anisotropic long range\nexchange constants in cubic, cuboctahedral and octahe-\ndral PbX, X=S,Se quantum dots with tetragonal symme-\ntry, similar to the ones studied in Ref. [12]. We demon-\nstrate that these intravalley quantities almost insensitive\nto the shape of the quantum dot and agree very well\nwith effective mass calculations. Direct access to the val-\nley states allows us to show that velocity and exchange\nCoulomb matrix elements in PbS quantum dots are much\nmore anisotropic than in PbSe in the considered range of\nquantum dot diameters from 3 nm to 25 nm.\nII.

The index is defined as the\ntrace\nIN(q) = TrHN\n1\n2-BPS(−1)FqR, (1.1)\nwhere HN\n1\n2-BPSis the1\n2-BPS Hilbert space consisting of states that are annihilated by a\ncertain 16 of the 32 supercharges of the theory, ( −1)Fis the fermion number operator,\nandRis one of the Cartan generators of the SU(4) R-symmetry of the theory. The1\n2-BPS\noperators in the free theory are arbitrary holomorphic functions of one of the matrix-valued\ncomplex scalars of the SYM theory with R= 1. The ring of such functions is generated\nfreely by the first Npowers of the matrix, and the index is therefore given by\nIN(q) =1\n(q)N(1.2)\n– 1 –in terms of the q-Pochhammer symbol ( q)n:=Qn\nj=1(1−qj). A well-known mathematical\nresult (see Appendix A for a derivation) is that this index can be rewritten as follows\nIN(q) = I∞(q)∞X\nm=0(−1)mqm(m+1)/2\n(q)mqmN. (1.3)\nThe aim of this paper is to provide a bulk interpretation of the right-hand side of this\nformula in terms of wrapped D-branes in the dual Type IIB theory on AdS 5×S5, i.e. giant\ngravitons [1].\nIt should be noted that the interpretation of giant gravitons in the AdS/CFT cor-\nrespondence has been discussed from different points of view in the past [2–13] and, in\nparticular, canonical quantization of the moduli space of bulk D-branes, using a certain\nsymplectic form, directly leads to the product formula on the left-hand side of (1.2) [14, 15].\nThe present work, instead, identifies each term of the right-hand side of (1.2) from the bulk\npoint of view, in the spirit of the recently-discussed “giant graviton expansion” [16–18].\nBroader context\nMore generally, one can consider the superconformal index in a d-dimensional superconfor-\nmal field theory (SCFT d) on a compact spatial manifold, which is defined as a generalized\nWitten index, as in (1.1), of BPS states that are annihlated by some number of supercharges\nof the theory. In its simplest form it depends on one parameter qwhich is the fugacity\nfor a charge Rthat commutes with the preserved supercharges, and can be written as a\nq-expansion,\nTrHBPS(−1)FqR=X\nrd(r)qr. (1.4)\nThe coefficients d(r) have the interpretation of the (indexed) number of states with charge\nR=r. One can also have refinements of (1.4) with other fugacities coupling to other\ncommuting charges.\nThe index (1.4) is invariant under small changes of couplings of the theory [19]. Modulo\nissues of wall-crossing (which will not appear in this paper) the value of the index at zero\ncoupling equals that at strong coupling, where it should have a gravitational interpretation\nin the dual AdS space according to the AdS/CFT correspondence. At zero coupling,\nthe index of states preserving various fractions of supercharges can be calculated using\neither an explicit enumeration of operators, or by localizin"}

Close to (but prior to) the Higgs transition signaling the breakdown of\nfractionalization, the topological bands of zeros acquire a finite “lifetime”. We also discuss the ap-\npearance of edge states and edge zeros at real space domain walls separating different phases of the\nsystem. This model provides a fertile ground for controlled studies of the phenomenology of Green’s\nfunction zeros and the underlying exactly solvable lattice gauge theory illustrates the synergetic\ncross-pollination between solid-state theory, high-energy physics and quantum information science.\nThe spectrum of low-lying excitations is central to\nquantum-many body physics and reflected in poles of\nthe electronic Green’s function (GF) [1]. Interpreted\nas a propagator, the GF encodes quantum mechanical\ntransition amplitudes. From this perspective, it is a\nnatural and tantalizing question to also study nodes of\nthe amplitudes indicating destructive many-body inter-\nference. This results in GF zeros which are key to Fermi\nsurface reconstruction and pseudogap physics — a ma-\njor open problem in quantum materials research [2–9].\nJust like their counterpart, the poles, GF zeros defined\nbyGR(ϵ∅(k),k)ψ(k)=0 trace a bandstructure ϵ∅(k)\nin the Brillouin zone (BZ).

In this theory, correlators of physical fermions are\ngiven by convolutions of propagators of fractionalized\nexcitations. Equipped with this fundamental structure\nwe can exactly prove in the soluble limit (i.e. with a\nstatic Z2gauge field) that the physical GFs possess ze-\nros. This provides us with a starting point for a con-\ntrolled perturbative expansion about the integrable limit,\nin which we demonstrate that dispersing GF zeros form\na topologically non-trivial bandstructure, but that their\nexistence is not directly related to quantized topologi-\ncal transport coefficients. An infinite order resummation\nof leading Feynman diagrams allows to access the exact\nlong-wavelength GF in the vicinity of the deconfinement-\nconfinement Higgs transition. As the transition is ap-\nproached, the mass of GF zeros increases and hits the\ncontinuum of excitations (i.e. poles) in the system.

Family Puzzle\nThe 3 families or 3 generations of quarks and leptons of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics had been\nadvocated since the 1970s [1]. The Family Puzzle or Generation Problem demands an explanation of what dictates the\nSM family number Nf= 3. Any valid theoretical solution to this puzzle, unraveling the SM’s underlying mysterious\nstructure, can guide us further to explore Beyond the Standard Model physics (BSM) with elevated confidence, making\nnew predictions. What is the evidence of Nf= 3?\nOn one hand, in the quark sector, the (C)KM matrix indicates that the charge-conjugation-parity CP symmetry\nviolation of quarks via the weak interaction predicts the existence of at least 3 families of quarks in nature theoretically\n[2]. The discovery of the most massive known elementary particle, top quark t, in 1995 by the CDF and Dø experiments\nat the Fermilab [3, 4] confirmed the completion of 3 families of quarks experimentally. Moreover, if there is any gapped\nhypothetical 4th generation of quarks massive than tquark, say t′andb′quarks, the Higgs decay rate to two gluons\nϕH→ggthrough loop triangle Feynman diagrams of 3 types of virtual massive quarks ( t, t′, b′) will be enhanced by\na factor of 32= 9 times larger than the SM prediction, but which possibility has been excluded [5].\nOn the other hand, in the lepton sector, the Zboson (the third most massive known particle of about 91 GeV)\ndecays into at most 3 families of light neutrinos (assuming light neutrinos are lighter than about 45 GeV, namely\nmass mν< m Z/2), verified at CERN’s Large Electron Positron Collider (LEP) [6, 7]. In addition, the astrophysical\ndata from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) or big bang nucleosythesis (BBN) also suggest 3 families of light\nneutrinos [8].\nHere we show a novel theoretical solution to the Family Puzzle — the multiple of Nf= 3 of 16 Weyl fermions\nin the 3+1d spacetime dimensions are robust due to the almost purely topological constraints (without requiring\ninternal symmetry, neither global symmetry nor gauge structure) rooted in the profound mathematics and derivable\nin physics.1\nB.
