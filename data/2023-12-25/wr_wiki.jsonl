Like the church of San Michele Arcangelo, this building also stands on the remains of a small chapel Longobarda about eight meters wide.\nIn 1948 the church was elevated to the dignity of minor basilica. [1] The bell tower was constructed from 1400 to 1418, and is the oldest part of the church. [2]\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nIt is one of the most important baroque works in the province of Varese. Built to a design by Francesco Maria Richini[3], the foundation stone of the new basilica was laid on 26 May 1609, but the first service was not held until 1614, when the work was not yet completed, on the occasion of the patron saint's feast day. From the registers of the Fabrica di S. Giovanni and on the basis of the chronicles of the curate Pietro Antonio Crespi Castoldi, we know that from 1609 to 1613 the bones of the old cemetery near the church bell tower were removed and the perimeter foundations were laid, followed by the construction of the chapel dedicated to Sant'Ambrogio. The apses of the old church were demolished in 1610 and the main chapel was built between 1611 and 1612. The transept was completed in 1614 and its chapels were immediately used for the celebration of religious services. The foundations of the new façade were laid in March 1616 and in the same year the chapel of St. Charles and the chapel of the Relics were built[4]. Work continued at a slow pace for various reasons, including the plague of 1630, and the dome was completed in 1635, 26 years after work began[5].\n\nThe basilica was consecrated in 1640 or 1646 by the bishop of Bobbino, Monsignor Francesco Maria Abbiati.\n\nArchitectural Design[edit]\nExterior[edit]\nFacciata della Basilica\nFaçade[edit]\n\nThe imposing façade consists of a lower order of coupled Ionic style pilasters, a prothyrum with an arched pediment, doors made of copper and bronze with bas-reliefs depicting the life of St. John the Baptist (work of Enrico Astorri from 1908), statues of St. Ambrose, St. Charles Borromeo, Faith and Charity and countless other works from various eras.[6] However, the façade was still incomplete: the upper part was completed between 1699 and 1701 by Domenico Valmagini, who inserted a large oval window, a double-curved broken pediment, the statues of St. Peter St. Paul and four prophets (all works by Giovanni Pozzi), and the central statue of St. John the Baptist (by Siro Zanelli), which represents the highest point of the façade.\n\nBell Tower[edit]\n\nBuilt in the early years of the 15th century, the basilica's bell tower was built for two reasons: one was obviously religious, since in 1400 the town of Busto Arsizio was experiencing a period of plague that increased religious commotion to the point of building a concrete work that symbolised the devotion of the people of Busto Arsizio. The second was military: the construction of the bell tower was, in fact, partly financed by the municipality, as it could have been used as a watchtower for defensive purposes, since the church was located not far from the centre of the rectangle of fortifications[7]. In 1409, the main bell was cast and placed on the bell tower, while the construction was completed in 1418, the year Pope Martin V came to Milan for the consecration of the high altar of the Duomo[7].\n\nInterior[edit]\n\nInside, the church is covered with barrel vaults and ribbed vaults, the three naves are separated by rows of Ionic style piers and columns. Under the arches hang large canvases depicting the life of St. John the Baptist, painted between the end of the 17th century and the beginning of the 18th century by unknown artists, with the exception of Jesus with the disciples of the Baptist and Herodias and Salome with the head of the Baptist, attributed to Carlo Preda. The left transept hosts, instead, two frescoes of the 17th century (Rest during the Flight into Egypt and Nativity), attributed to Antonio Crespi Castoldi. More recent (between 1904 and 1923) are the decorations with pinkish grit and variegated marble (by Giuseppe Cerami and Pirro Bottaro) and the frescoes of the dome (Glorification of the Baptist), the pendentives (Evangelists) and the vaults (Blessed Juliana and Blessed Bernardino, Immaculate Conception, The Eucharist and The Pope) and the minor transept (Four Prophets) all works by Carlo Grossi, as well as the Way of the Cross in bronze and the portals by Enrico Astorri (1908). On the other hand, carved wooden works such as the pulpit, the choir and the compass date back to the 18th century. Over a period of eight years, between 1757 and 1765, Biagio Bellotti realised the frescoes of the apsidal area of the church. On the vault of the chancel is depicted the Glory of St. Sabinus, in the apse basin Paradise and on the wall of the apse The Baptism of Jesus Christ in the waters of the Jordan.\n\nThe \"mortuary\"[edit]\n\nOutside the church, on the right-hand side, is the \"mortorio\", a small temple by an unknown author, painted between 6 September 1689 and 2 November 1692[8], which was meant to remind passers-by of the mystery of death by displaying skulls, still visible today from Via Milano. Inside, there are paintings of angels and symbolism on the Passion. Paintings were also visible outside, works by the brothers Ambrogio Gelli, Francesco and Biagio Bellotti (the latter grandfather of the Bustocco painter of the same name), depicting the ages of man, the various aspects of death, virtues, purgatory and weeping angels, removed in 1975 and transferred to the Church of San Gregorio Magno in Camposanto.\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ Transclusion error: {{En}} is only for use in File namespace.

However, Baba Harnam Singh had been connected with the Damdami Taksal since a young age and had enrolled into the organization through the ceremony of Amrit Sanskar.[citation needed]\n\nBeing a member of the Damdami Taksal, Baba Harnam Singh had always been involved with the profound influence that this organization had held in Punjab. The Taksal has been very active throughout the 1980s, constantly preaching within the rural villages of Punjab, under the leadership of the controversial figure of Sikh politics, Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, who had later been killed alongside hundreds of other Sikhs, a lot of which belonged to the Taksal, during Operation Blue Star in 1984.[2]\n\nDuring the age of Insurgency in Punjab, India, it is claimed that Baba Harnam Singh had been imprisoned by the Punjab Police and tortured within custody though there is no evidence to support this allegation. Baba Harnam Singh had been a Sevadaar of the successor to Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, Baba Thakur Singh, who was an elderly member of the Taksal and had been assigned by the Jatha to carry on organizational (Karajkari) duties.[citation needed]\n\nIn the early 1990s, Baba Harnam Singh has been said to have moved to the city of Manteca, California, where he resided for 14 years. It is believed that he spent these years in the US meditating in the house of Sikhs which belonged to the Taksal, and that he gained dual citizenship of the United States.[3]\n\nJathedari[edit]\n\nThe story surrounding the Jathedari of Baba Harnam Singh has always been quite controversial. After the death of Baba Thakur Singh in 2004, it is said that Baba Harnam Singh had been flown in from America instantly to undergo the Dastarbandi ceremony. The immediate arrival of him was seen by the public as very unusual, but the Damdami Taksal had supported his accession to the seat with a letter which has been claimed to have been written by Baba Thakur Singh which states that Baba Harnam Singh would succeed him. However, this letter itself has been seen as untrustworthy.[citation needed]\n\nDuring the same time as the Dastarbandi ceremony of Baba Harnam Singh, another prominent figure within the Damdami Taksal, known as Baba Ram Singh Sangrawan, had claimed to have been the justified successor, and his own faction held a separate ceremony, in which all Sikhs were invited to attend. Despite this situation, most of the Sikh community acknowledged Baba Harnam Singh as the rightful heir. In 2017, he was officially declared as the heir to Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and the 15th Jathedar of Damdami Taksal by the SGPC.[4]\n\nControversy[edit]\n\nIn 2016, another prominent Sikh preacher, Ranjit Singh Dhadrian Wala, who had been seen as an opponent to Baba Harnam Singh, was attacked alongside his Jatha in his vehicle while travelling near Barewal village. Ranjit Singh had survived despite having several injuries, while a member of his Jatha, Bhupinder Singh, had been killed. It is claimed that his Jatha was attacked while they had stopped at a 'Chabeel' stand, when unidentified individuals began the attack while raising slogans of \"Khalistan Zindabad\".[5]\n\nBaba Harnam Singh and Ranjit Singh Dhadrian Wala had been at the heart of a philosophical conflict for a long period of time, as they had profound disagreements on various matters regarding Sikh faith, such as controversy on the Dasam Granth. After this attack had been carried out, most people of Punjab, India had suspected Damdami Taksal under the leadership of Baba Harnam Singh to have had a hand in the event. Within a few days, Baba Harnam Singh had openly spoken about this attack and stated that some students of the Taksal had taken part of what had occurred, but that he was unaware and had condemned the atrocity.[6]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"Baba Harnam Singh Acting chief of Taksal\".

{"date": "2023-12-25-16-54", "error": false, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Place_for_Wolves", "text_blocks": "A Place for Wolves\nBook cover\n\nAuthor\tKosoko Jackson\nCountry\tUnited States\nLanguage\tEnglish\nGenre\tRomantic thriller\nHistorical fiction\nYoung adult fiction\nSet in\tKosovo\n\nA Place for Wolves is a young adult novel by Kosoko Jackson. Although the novel was scheduled to be published in 2019 by Sourcebooks, its release was cancelled by Jackson soon before publication when it faced social media backlash for perceived insensitivities in its depiction of the Kosovo War.[1][2]\n\nBackground[edit]\n\nA Place for Wolves was to be Jackson's debut novel. He had previously worked as a sensitivity reader for major publishing companies, identifying content regarded as offensive or problematic in book manuscripts.[1][3]\n\nJackson, a gay black man, had been an advocate of the #ownvoices movement, which promotes books with characters of diverse identities written by authors who share those identities.[4] He had argued that, for example, \"stories about the civil rights movement should be written by black people\" and criticized female authors who \"profit\" from gay men's stories.[1][3] Jackson had also been a prominent critic of Blood Heir by Amélie Wen Zhao, a young adult novel that in January 2019 faced accusations of racial insensitivity before its publication.[4][5]\n\nPlot[edit]\n\nThe novel takes place during the Kosovo War of the late 1990s. It follows James Mills, a gay African American teenager who lives in the Kosovar village of Restelicë with his aid worker parents. When war breaks out in the region and he is separated from his parents, James attempts to flee with his Brazilian boyfriend Tomas to the safety of the U.S. embassy in Pristina.[6]\n\nReception[edit]\nAdvance reviews[edit]\n\nPrior to its publication date in March 2019, A Place for Wolves had received a starred review from Booklist and been selected for IndieBound's \"Kids' Indie Next\" list.[3] The book's marketing included blurbs from young adult authors such as Shaun David Hutchinson, praising it as \"a masterful debut,\" and Heidi Heilig, who called it \"an intricate, rich story\".[6]\n\nReception on social media[edit]\n\nBacklash to A Place for Wolves on social media began in February 2019 with a review posted to Goodreads. The review criticized Jackson's choice to make the novel's villain an Albanian Muslim with the Kosovo Liberation Army, since Kosovo Albanians had been subject to widespread ethnic cleansing during the war and since it contributed to stereotypes about Muslims as terrorists.[1][4][6] The review suggested that readers who enjoyed the novel might suffer from \"subconscious Islamophobia\" and argued that the book had potential to cause real-world harm.[7] Journalist Jesse Singal later challenged this perception, stating that the villain's religion was not mentioned in the novel and that the KLA had also committed atrocities during the war, albeit on a smaller scale than the opposing Serbian forces.[6][8]\n\nIn addition, the review argued that the novel was insensitive because it emphasized the perspectives of Americans while using the war as merely a backdrop for the story. It criticized Jackson for writing about a largely Muslim country as a non-Muslim author with non-Muslim main characters.[1][7][9]\n\nThe contents of the Goodreads review were quickly amplified and spread on Twitter by members of the website's young adult fiction community. Since the book had not yet been released, most of those criticizing it had not read it.[3][6] Heilig and others edited their formerly positive Goodreads reviews of the book, with Heilig apologizing \"to those I've hurt by my blurb\". Jackson was also removed from the lineup of an upcoming literary festival.[1][7]\n\nSix days after the review was published, Jackson released a statement apologizing for the novel's \"problematic representation and historical insensitivities,\" writing: \"I failed to fully understand the people and the conflict that I set around my characters. I have done a disservice to the history and to the people who suffered.\" He also announced that he had asked Sourcebooks, the novel's publisher, to withdraw it from publication.[1][5][10]\n\nLater reviews[edit]\n\nFollowing the reaction on social media, commentators took an interest in the book's artistic merits. After obtaining an advance copy of the book, Jesse Singal wrote that A Place for Wolves \"isn't great, but it didn't deserve to be canceled.\" He called Jackson's writing \"clunky\" and the book's characters \"poorly developed,\" criticizing it for the \"flatness\" of the wartime setting.[6][8] Jennifer Senior of The New York Times said that although Jackson \"can write with charm and the authentic sass of an American adolescent, much of the book is painfully clumsy and poorly paced — which makes it a fairly typical debut novel, by the way.\"[3]\n\nAnalysis[edit]\n\nMedia reactions to A Place for Wolves' cancellation mainly examined it through the lens of cancel culture and online shaming. Katy Waldman wrote in The New Yorker that the debate surrounding the book \"seems rooted in who gets to speak, and when, and how much power their words can wield\". She noted the irony that Jackson had previously been involved in assessing and calling out books for controversial content before becoming entangled in controversy himself.[5]\n\nRuth Graham of Slate criticized the \"increasingly toxic online culture\" in young adult literature, \"with evermore-baroque standards for who can write about whom under what circumstances.\"[1] Jennifer Senior of The New York Times called the incident \"frightening,\" saying that attacking authors in the name of diversity would actually lead to an overly censored \"dreary monoculture\" in book publishing.[3]\n\nIn an article for Reason, Jesse Singal argued that the book's critics were adherents of \"left-wing identitarianism,\" a worldview that sees individuals as oppressed or oppressors, and therefore good or bad, based on certain identity characteristics. He claimed that this viewpoint was common among a highly vocal minority of young adult fiction readers on social media, making it appear deceptively popular to publishers and authors.[8]\n\nSee also[edit]\nBlood Heir\nCancel culture\nDiversity in young adult fiction\nIdentity politics\nOnline shaming\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d e f g h Graham, Ruth (March 4, 2019). \"Wolves\".

He was previously signed to the UFC to compete on the Welterweight division and is ranked #44 in the division.\n\nBiography[edit]\n\nHailing all the way from Osh, Kyrgyzstan, Orolbai would be the first ever male Kyrgyz mixed martial artist to ever compete in the UFC and the first Kyrgyz mixed martial artist to enter the said promotion without any dual citizenship (both Valentina Shevchenko and Antonina Shevchenko have dual citizenship), aside from that, he is known to finish his opponents early having seven fights out of fourteen end in the first round and three fights ending in the second round.[1]\n\nMixed martial arts career[edit]\nAmateur career[edit]\n\nAs an amateur, Orolbai competed in the WMMAA junior world cup 2018 of the welterweight division and defeated Ma Meng Hao of China via unanimous decision before defeating Belarus' Ilya Kygach in the finals of the tournament, he showed his diligence, might and resilience in the matches that would make him a subsequent threat.\n\nWorld Ertaymash Federation[edit]\n\nOrolbai enters Kyrgyzstan's World Ertaymash Federation (WEF) promotion to mark the start of his professional career, his debut match is against a fellow professional debutant, Eldiyar Toobaev whom he would defeat via rear naked choke submission in the first round, he fought against Shakhzod Kholmatov whom he also defeated the same way in the first round.\n\nMoving on, Orolbai would later fight in the Professional Fighters League Kyrgyzstan (PFL KG) against Saidal Khazmuradov and he once again defeated his foe via 1st round submission.\n\nTransitioning from 2018 to 2019, Orolbai would have his first non-win match as his match against Fakhreddin Myrzadavlatov for the Kara-Suu Lightweight Championship in January 20, 2019 ends in a stalemate on the events of the WEF Selection 20, on WEF Selection 22, Orolbai would finally be able to be selected on a more major promotions as he defeated Faruh Kadirov via rear naked choke submission in the first round and did so within 1 minute and showed his worthiness to be selected by a major promotion.\n\nRoad Fighting Championship Russia[edit]\n\nAfter winning the WEF Selection match, Orolbai was immediately drafted to Road Fighting Championship Russia and competed against undefeated undefeated Russian Shamil Mutalimov.

His younger brother was the future General Henryk. After graduating from high school he went to St. Petersburg and studied natural sciences at the St. Petersburg University. From 1898, he was active in the Polish Socialist Party, for which he was arrested twice. In 1900, he received his graduation diploma and moved to Kazan University, where for four years he was an assistant at the Department of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy. He conducted hydrobiological research in the freshwater station in Bologoje, and then in the saltwater stations in Sevastopol, Banyuls-sur-Mer and Villefranche-sur-Mer. In 1904, he defended his doctoral thesis and went to Warsaw. For his participation in the 1905 Revolution, he was arrested and imprisoned in the Citadel but released due to lack of evidence. From 1905 he worked again at the Villefranche sur Mer station for a year and then decided to remain in exile. Initially he worked at the station in Roscoff and Monaco, and then stayed in Paris and Brussels.[1]\n\nIn 1917 he moved to Warsaw, where for a year he was employed at the Department of Physiology of the Society for Scientific Courses. From November 1918, he worked scientifically in the Department of General Biology of the Warsaw Scientific Society, which he established and headed.[2]\n\nMinkiewicz was a leading activist in the freedom of thought movement. He was a co-founder of the Polish Association Freethinkers in 1920 and in 1921 he established a non-denominational commune in Warsaw and was its chairman for a short time. He also founded the organ of the Association of Freethinkers \"Myśl Wolna\" in 1922.[3]\n\nHe workers at the Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology and was its chairman from 1926to 1931 and a member of its presidium from 1920 to 1939. From 1920 to 1924 he co-organized the first Polish Hydrobiological Station of the Nencki Institute on Wigry. He dealt with animal ethology and the physiology of perception.[2]\n\nMinkiewicz was also involved in literary work. He made his debut as a poet in 1903. He published his poems and dramas in the Young Poland style in various magazines. He was also a member of the Trade Union of Polish Writers.[3]\n\nDuring the period of Nazi occupation of Poland, Minkiewicz mostly dedicated himself to private scholarship. He died as a result of a gunshot to the knee during the Warsaw Uprising and was buried at the Czerniakowski Cemetery.[1]\n\n^ \nJump up to:\na b \"Romuald Minkiewicz | Historia Polski\" (in Polish). 2018-01-12.

Affectionately nicknamed \"La Mariposa de la Bomba\" (The Butterfly of Bomba), Cepeda is celebrated for her captivating stage presence, deep knowledge of bomba history and rhythms, and commitment to passing on these traditions to future generations.[1][2][3]\n\nEarly life and artistic roots[edit]\n\nCepeda was born in 1945 in Cataño, Puerto Rico, into a family deeply embedded in the cultural world of bomba y plena. Her grandparents, Doña Caridad Brenes Caballero and Rafael Cepeda Atiles, were renowned bomba practitioners, known as \"Los Patriarcas de la Bomba y la Plena.\" Raised by her grandparents from the age of three months, Cepeda was immersed in the rich rhythms and stories of bomba from an early age. This familial foundation instilled in her a profound love and respect for these ancestral traditions.[2][4]\n\nPerforming career and cultural advocacy[edit]\n\nCepeda began performing bomba in her childhood, joining her family ensemble and participating in community cultural events. Throughout her career, she has graced stages across Puerto Rico, the United States, and the world, mesmerizing audiences with her dynamic artistry and vibrant spirit. As a lead singer and dancer, she embodies the essence of bomba, her every movement and vocal intonation pulsating with the rhythm of the drums and the spirit of her ancestors.[2][4]\n\nBeyond her own performances, Cepeda has dedicated herself to the preservation and transmission of bomba y plena. She established the renowned Escuela de Bomba y Plena Doña Caridad Brenes de Cepeda in 1976, named after her grandmother. This school serves as a vital center for learning and practicing bomba y plena, offering classes to students of all ages and backgrounds. Through her teaching, Cepeda has nurtured countless bomba and plena practitioners, ensuring the continuation of these cultural treasures for generations to come.[2][4][3]\n\nRecognition and legacy[edit]\n\nCepeda's contributions to Puerto Rican culture have been widely recognized. She has received numerous awards and honors, including the Premio Nacional de Cultura del Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña (National Culture Award from the Puerto Rican Institute of Culture) and the National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. In 2023, the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C., held a special event titled Bámbula: The Legacy of Tata Cepeda, celebrating her lifetime achievements and the enduring power of bomba.[5][1]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b Santiago, Javier (2023-03-16). \"A brillar Tata Cepeda en Washington\".

The Mussolinis used it as a summer holiday home,[4] and expanded the property in 1940, adding an additional floor.[5] Mussolini would conduct government business from the villa and host notable guests and foreign dignitaries during his stays.[3][5][6]\n\nIn 1997, the villa – by then called Villa Margherita – was purchased by the Cassa di Risparmio di Rimini, who loaned it to Riccione's municipal government.[5][6][7][8] After a one-million-euro restoration,[8][9] the villa reopened as Villa Mussolini in 2005. It hosts cultural events and exhibitions,[3][8][10] as well as civil wedding ceremonies.[11] The villa's name and use continues to attract local controversy.[9][10][12][13]\n\nHistory[edit]\nEarly years (1892-1934)[edit]\n\nThe villa was built in 1892 for Marquise Eugenia Beccadelli,[1] who divided her time between Florence and Bologna.[1][7] Its architect was Ferdinando Mancini.[7] The villa features on the 1895 map drawn for the state's first bathing resort concessions.[7][14][15]\n\nThe two-storey villa originally had thirteen rooms, including a garage, greenhouse, and laundry room;[2] it included a side-turret on its south side,[1][3] which faced east towards the main entrance.[1] The property was set in 1,397 square metres (15,040 sq ft) of land.[2]\n\nBeccadelli died in 1904,[7] and the villa subsequently passed into the ownership of Giulio Monti of Ferrara,[1][7] from which derived the name of Villa Monti.[1][7][16] It was then sold to the family of Count Angeletti of Bologna,[1][5] who sold it to Giulia Galli Bernabei, its last owner before the Mussolinis.[1][2][4][5][7]\n\nPurchase by Rachele Guidi (1934)[edit]\nVilla Mussolini in 1935\n\nFor some years before their purchase of the villa, the family of Benito Mussolini, Italy's fascist dictator, had spent their summer holidays on the riviera romagnola; Mussolini and his second wife, Rachele Guidi, were themselves from Romagna's countryside.[2][4][5] In 1924 and 1925, the family stayed in Cattolica.[4] In 1926, they stayed in the villa of Count Terzi in Riccione,[2][4][5][6] opposite the Grand Hotel Des Bains and near the Mater Admirabilis church.[4][6][16] Between 1927 and 1932, they stayed at Domenico Galavotti's Hotel Al Lido on Piazzale Roma.[4][6] In 1933, the family moved to Pietro Tontini's Hotel Milano Helvetia; Tontini and Mussolini were comrades in the First World War.[4]\n\nGuidi was keen to purchase a property in Riccione for their next summer stay. She paid 170,000 lire for Galli Bernabei's villa;[2][4][5] the purchase deed was signed on 2 July 1934,[2][4][5][16] and registered in Forlì on 21 July 1940.[2] Galli Bernabei did not want to sell the villa, and was persuaded only after the intervention of Frangiotto Pullè, Riccione's mayor.[7] According to one account, Guidi purchased the villa using money intended as a donation to the Opera Nazionale Balilla, leaving her husband under the impression that the villa was a gift from the people of Riccione.[4][5] Other versions say that Guidi used money from local party subscriptions,[5] or royalties from Mussolini's articles in Fortune.[6]\n\nMussolini summer holiday home (1934-1944)[edit]\nMussolini and his son, Romano, on Riccione's beach in 1932\n\nThe villa was guarded by 150 soldiers, reaching 300 during the summer holidays. The Presidential Guard, dressed in black, were nicknamed furnarèin (cockroaches) by locals for their ability to appear unexpectedly from street corners.[4] Mussolini would conduct government business from Riccione during his stays, including welcoming visting dignatories.[3][5][6] Guests at the villa included singer Gea della Garisenda [it], senator Teresio Borsalino [it], and Austrian chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss.[6] Dollfuss' family were staying in Riccione during his assassination in July 1934,[4][10] and it was at the Villa Mussolini that Galeazzo Ciano, Italy's Minister of Foreign Affairs, informed Mussolini of Operation Barbarossa in June 1941.[10] It is believed that the villa included a cinema room which showed foreign films prohibited by the regime.[6]\n\nMussolini would arrive in Riccione from Rome on a Savoia-Marchetti three-engined seaplane. A 75-metre (246-foot) ship, Aurora, would be stationed off Riccione's coast.[17] Mussolini would bathe in the sea, where he would be greeted by crowds and photographers.[16][17] As a result of his association with the area, Riccione's development is cliched as dependent on Mussolini's patronage.[17]\n\nOn 1 July 1939, the Rimini–Riccione route 11 trolleybus line opened near the villa, replacing a previous tramway.[18][19][20][21] The line terminated at Piazzale dei Giardini; it was reconfigured shortly after its construction to bring trolleybuses to terminate on the piazzale's mountain-facing side, thereby avoiding trolleybuses passing near Villa Mussolini and disturbing guests.[21][22] Guidi used the trolleybuses during her stays at the villa.[21]\n\n1940 expansion and renovation[edit]\n\nIn 1940, the property was expanded with the annexation of the land between the present-day Viale Milano, Via dei Giardini, and Viale Ippolito Nievo.[1][3][5] The property was thus brought to a total area of 6,000 square metres (1.5 acres).[5]\n\nSome of the existing buildings in the annexed area were destroyed and replaced with a tennis court and garden, including a vegetable garden and shed.[5] A high perimeter wall was built, and new buildings were erected for Mussolini's children on the new land.[1]\n\nThe main villa itself was renovated with the addition of a third floor and a ground-floor veranda.[5] The works were overseen by the Swiss engineer Dario Pater using populit [it], an unstable material of concrete and chipboard for prefabricated buildings developed under Italy's autarky.[5][23][24][25] The works cost 6 million lire, paid by the Ministry of the Interior.[5]\n\nPost-war abandonment (1944-97)[edit]\n\nAfter the Second World War, Villa Mussolini remained in Guidi's ownership:[5] as it was not registered in Mussolini's name, it was not entirely requisitoned by the state.[1] Galli Barnabei, the villa's pre-fascist owner, was elected Riccione's municipal mayor and unsuccessfully attempted to regain the villa's possession.[5] In 1946, a court in Rome ceded the villa's front part to the municipal government, who destroyed the patio to restore Viale Milano. Villa Mussolini was sold in 1952, and was the site of various commercial activites,[1] including a restaurant,[26] until it was abandoned to decay in the 1980s.[1]\n\nIn the post-war years, the villa came to be known as Villa Margherita, commonly believed to have been the villa's name before the Mussolinis, though incorrectly: Margherita was the name of a separate, neighbouring villa belonging to the Galli Bernabei family that was demolished in the 1940 expansion.[7]\n\nIn 1979, Terzo Pierani, Riccione's communist mayor, suggested flattening the villa;[9] the local communist party maintained an unsuccessful campaign for its demolition.[27][28] In 1983, Pierani's administration purchased the garden to transform it into a public green area, reversing the 1940 expansion. The area now houses Piazzale Eugenio Curiel, which includes a bus station and car park.[3][5] To some historical irony, it became the terminus of the route 11 trolleybus in 1994.[22][29]\n\nPurchase and 2005 renovation (1997-)[edit]\n\nIn the 1990s, the Friends of Riccione Association campaigned for the villa's reacquisition.[5] In 1997, it was purchased by the Cassa di Risparmio di Rimini, who loaned it to the municipal government for its restoration.[5][6][30] In turn, the municipal government was contractually able to use the villa for thirty years.[8] The restoration cost 1 million euros,[9][8] divided 3:1 between the municipal and provincial governments.[9][27]\n\nThe villa reopened in 2005.[1][5][6][31] Controversially, Romano Mussolini, son of Benito, was among 350 guests at the reopening ceremony on 17 July 2005, at the invitation of the municipal mayor.[8][27][30] Since its reopening, the property has been used for cultural events and exhibitions,[3] as well as civil wedding ceremonies.[11]\n\nThe Cassa di Risparmio, which by then had become Banca Carim, advertised the property for sale in December 2017;[6][32] Villa Mussolini was still reported to be in the bank's possession in March 2023.[33]\n\nName controversy[edit]\n\nFollowing the 2005 renovation,[12] the centre-left municipal administration officially restored the 'Villa Mussolini' name, to local controversy.[9][10][12][13] As a result of the villa's name, some entertainers have refused to perform at the venue.[9][13][33]\n\nIn August 2020, Lodovico Zanetti, the president of Forlì's ANPI chapter, suggested that the villa be renamed after the Matatia family,[34] three Jewish brothers from Corfu who settled in Riccione in the 1920s. The eldest brother, Nissim, bought a villa within eyesight of Villa Mussolini; his family was deported and killed in Auschwitz.[35] Roberto Matatia, Nissim's nephew, published a book in January 2014 recounting the family's history in proximity to Villa Mussolini, entitled The Inconvenient Neighbours.[35][36]\n\nIn April 2021, the municipality freely loaned the villa to an agency promoting Riccione's candidacy for UNESCO heritage. The loan was criticised for attaching Mussolini's name to the candidacy.[10]\n\nVillino Pater \"Cacetta\"[edit]\n\nThe Villa Mussolini complex included a cottage, known as Villino Pater or \"Cacetta\", which is still extant on Via Latini. The villa was owned by the engineer Dario Pater. It was twinned with another villa and connected by a portico; its twin, which no longer exists, belonged to Mussolini's nephew.[37] Like the 1940 additions to Villa Mussolini, the villa was constructed using populit.[5][23][24]\n\nIn October 2019, the municipal government sold the villa to a Milanese real estate company for 600,000 euros.[23][38][39][40] It was advertised for sale again in February 2020, for 980,000 euros.[41] A section of the wall collapsed in August 2020,[23][40] bringing down also part of the attic and the floor of the first floor.[23]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p \"Villa Mussolini\".

During his tenure in Cuzco, he was ousted during the Peruvian Civil War of 1894–1895, fleeing to La Paz.\n\nCareer[edit]\n\nIn 1882, after the entry of Andrés Avelino Cáceres to the city of Huamanga—until then occupied by Nicolás de Piérola—during the War of the Pacific, the trial of Mas, who had held the position of Prefect of Ica, was ordered, as he had committed abuses in the towns of Nazca and Palpa.[1]\n\nAfter the rise to power of Miguel Iglesias, Pedro Mas was appointed Prefect of Ayacucho in 1883 and during his administration he ordered the second closure of the San Cristóbal of Huamanga University on January 31, 1885.[2] By Law of April 21, 1885, the Congress of Peru promoted Pedro Mas to Brigadier General.[3] During the civil war of 1884 and 1885, Más, who held the position of prefect of Junín,[4] was part of the Iglesista side after the end of the War of the Pacific. After the first Cacerist defeat in Lima, Pedro Mas led a division of the Iglesista Army, known as the \"Pacificadora del Centro\" with the purpose of putting the towns of the departments of Junín and Huancavelica under Iglesias' control. Between November 1884 and February 1885, the \"Pacificadora del Centro\" found effective resistance in the indigenous peasant guerrillas from Huancayo to Huancavelica and Huanta, from Ayacucho to Acobamba to Chongos Alto.[5]\n\nIn 1894 he was appointed by President Andrés A. Cáceres as prefect of Cuzco and commander of the Southern Army, the army of about 2,000 men that would defend the Cacerista regime in the departments of Puno and Cuzco during the Civil War of 1894 and 1895.[6] During his administration, he established a tyrannical military government that banished civilians opposed to the government of Cáceres to Taquile Island, in Lake Titicaca, but imposed quotas and committed robberies directed by him and executed by the subprefect Antonio Marzo and the head of the gendarmes Felipe Santiago Masías, who imposed terror on the people of Cuzco.[7]\n\nThe Mas regime generated the organization of Pierolist Montoneras led by various cuzqueños, such as David Samanez Ocampo, and José Lucas Chaparro who, leaving from Urubamba Province, took the city on April 3, 1895.[6] Pedro Mas, hearing of the fall of the Cácerista regime on March 17, 1895 in Lima, fled towards La Paz, Bolivia, taking with him the money from the Fiscal Fund.[7] He was formally dismissed from his position on April 4.[8]\n\nSee also[edit]\nPeruvian Civil War of 1894–1895\nReferences[edit]\n^ Pereyra Plasencia, Hugo (2017).

Written by Charles Marshal Hertig, a former secretary for Cornelius Vanderbilt II, the novel was published in May 1880.[2]\n\nAuthorship[edit]\n\nAt the time of publication, it was noted by the Boston Evening Transcript that whomever wrote the novel was \"evidently... versed in the ins and outs of criminal law.\" The paper went on to say, \"The author, whoever he may be, is possessed of a sharp pen and a fair ability to use it.\"[3]\n\nCharles Hertig, who began his career practicing law in Fort Wayne, Indiana, was later hired as the private secretary to Cornelius Vanderbilt II.

The purpose of the work would seem to be at once personal and malignant.\"[6]\n\nWhile The Times-Picayune raved, \"With materials so dramatic at hand, the author could not produce other than a most exciting book.\"[7] The Boston Post, called the novel \"the literary hit of the season!\"[8]\n\nExternal links[edit]\nThe Verdendorps on Google Books\nReferences[edit]\n^ a b \"The Vanderbilts in a Novel\".

Following the attack, settlers returned to the community to rebuild, and the Provincial Council of Pennsylvania began constructing a chain of forts and blockhouses to protect settlers and fend off further raids. These forts provided an important defense during the French and Indian War.[2]: 218 \n\nBackground[edit]\n1770 map of the Province of Pennsylvania showing Great Cove and Little Cove at the map's lower edge, just to the left of center.\n\nThe communities of Great Cove, Little Cove (Franklin County) and the Conolloways were probably settled soon after 1730 by Scotch-Irish immigrants. The land at that time was still recognized as belonging to Native Americans, but settlers set up homesteads and cleared the land without seeking formal ownership, in spite of \"frequent prohibitions on the part of the government and admonitions of the great danger they run of being cut off by the Indians, as these settlements were on lands not purchased of them.\"[3]: 384  In 1742, the Six Nations Iroquois Confederacy lodged a formal complaint, and settlers were warned against establishing homesteads in the area, but they continued to do so. In May 1750, 62 settlers living illegally on the Aughwick, Licking Creek and at Great Cove were convicted of trespassing and forcibly expelled by Provincial government authorities, which included Conrad Weiser, Richard Peters, George Croghan and Sheriff John Potter of Cumberland County.[4]: 764  Eleven cabins were burned in Path Valley, and three cabins were burned in Great Cove.[1]: 594  The area was subsequently referred to as Burnt Cabins, Pennsylvania.[5]: 3  Nonetheless, settlers returned to the area and reestablished their communities. Within a few months of burning the cabins, Richard Peters wrote to Conrad Weiser that \"The People over the Hills are combin'd against the Government, [and] are putting in new Cropps and bid us Defiance.\"[6]: 294–97  On the date of the massacre, 93 families are known to have resided in Great Cove, Little Cove, and the Conolloways.[5]: 5 \n\nFollowing General Edward Braddock's defeat on 9 July, 1755 at the Battle of the Monongahela, at the beginning of the French and Indian War, Pennsylvania was left without a professional military force.[7] Lenape chiefs Shingas and Captain Jacobs launched dozens of Shawnee and Delaware raids against British colonial settlements,[8] killing and capturing hundreds of colonists and destroying settlements across western and central Pennsylvania.[9] The nearby settlement of Penn's Creek was destroyed by Lenape warriors on 16 October.[10]\n\nMassacre[edit]\n19th century woodcut depicting a raid by Native American warriors on a colonial settlement similar to Great Cove.\n\nOn 1 November 1755, a band of about 100 Lenape and Shawnee warriors, and possibly a few French soldiers, launched attacks on the Great Cove settlement and a neighboring settlement known as the Conolloways, with the force splitting into two groups of 50 just before the assault. The Lenape chief Shingas is known to have participated, and also Captain Jacobs. At least one source states that the Lenape leader Tamaqua also took part in the attack.[11]: 210  Some of the settlers received advance warning of the attack, reportedly from a settler named Patrick Burns who had escaped from captivity among the Indians, and about half of those living in the two communities fled.[1]: 597 \n\nOn 2 November, The Pennsylvania Gazette reported:\n\n\"By Express this Day from Conegochtig (Conococheague) we are informed, that Yesterday the Settlements in the Great Cove and Cannalaways [Conolloways, a community on the Tonoloway Creek] were attacked by a Party of Indians, and several Houses seen in Flames, which, with the Firing of many Guns, gives sufficient Reason to think that the Inhabitants are all cut off or fled; we expect daily to be attacked here, and at Harris's Ferry, as these two Places have been particularly threatned: We have great Numbers from Lancaster and York Counties coming in every Day to our Assistance.\"[12]\n\nNo definitive account of the number of casualties exists, although a Pennsylvania Gazette article published on 13 November names seven of those killed and eighteen taken captive, 11 of whom were children. Sheriff Potter testified on 14 November to provincial authorities that \"of ninety-three families which were settled in the two coves and the Conolloways, forty-seven [persons] were either killed or taken [prisoner].\" In a letter of 6 November, Adam Hoops reported \"about fifty persons killed or taken.\"[1]: 597 [3]: 94 \n\nIn a letter written on 2 November, Sheriff Potter gives an account of the attack and describes his efforts to pursue the Indians, stating that he took 40 men into the community but did not encounter any of the attackers. Later they were joined by \"a recruit\" of 60 men and \"held counsel whether to pursue up the valley all night or return to McDowell's, [but]...there were not six of these men that would consent to go in pursuit of the Indians.\" On 6 November, Adam Hoops wrote to Governor Robert Morris that Captain Hance Hamilton was arriving from York County with 200 men and that another 200 men from Lancaster County were prepared to fight.[1]: 597–98  Pennsylvania militia searched the area but lost the trail in the newly-fallen snow, although they found the body of a child, probably killed because he or she was unable to keep pace with the fleeing warriors.[13]: 167 \n\nCaptives[edit]\nEnglish captives being handed over to Colonel Henry Bouquet in November, 1764.\n\nCaptives taken during the raid were escorted back to Kittanning, a Lenape community that served as a staging area for raids on Pennsylvania settlements. Captain Jacobs told the Flemings that captives would be resettled as slaves among Native American communities sympathetic to the French in the Ohio Country,[14]: 10  but some captives were taken to Canada and sold to the French there. At least one captive is known to have escaped near Oswego, New York in September, 1756.[13]: 238  Three captives were released by the Lenape chief Tamaqua at the Lancaster Council of August 1762, and several others were handed over to Colonel Henry Bouquet at his camp on the Muskingum River in November 1764.[2]: 222 \n\nWilliam and Elizabeth Fleming[edit]\n\nWilliam and Elizabeth Fleming survived the massacre and were captured but managed to escape. In 1756, they published an account in Boston, describing their experiences.[15]: 7 [14][16] In this account, the Flemings state that William heard the warning issued by Patrick Burns, and immediately rode off to collect his pregnant wife and flee. He was ambushed by warriors on the way, however, and was captured. One warrior identified himself as Captain Jacobs, the leader of the assault, and he told Fleming to lead him to \"those Houses that were Most defenceless; and added...that he would Spare my Life on Condition I would help.\" Fleming then informed them that he was concerned for the safety of his wife, at which point Captain Jacobs said that, if Fleming led them to her, they would spare her life.[13]: 91–2  He agreed, hoping that as they approached the settlement, his neighbors might rescue him. After taking Elizabeth Fleming captive, the Indians ransacked the Flemings' home and set fire to it, then did the same to a neighbor's home, forcing William and Elizabeth to carry bags of items they had looted from the homes.[14]\n\nThat night, at a campfire, Captain Jacobs informed the Flemings that the Indians had learned during General Edward Braddock's failed Braddock Expedition, that he \"had threatned to destroy all the Indians on the Continent, after they had conquered the French, and they were informed by the French, the Pennsylvanians, Marylanders and Virginians had laid the same Plot.\" Jacobs added that the French \"had often assured the Indians it was no Sin to destroy Hereticks, and all the English were such,\" and that the Indians would not \"abuse\" (rape) his wife, as they believed that this would bring bad luck. After the warriors fell asleep, the Flemings managed to escape, but got separated in the darkness. William eventually reached the burning houses of Great Cove, then went on to Conococheague settlement, where he found 300 Pennsylvania militia, under the command of Hance Hamilton, preparing to pursue the Indians. Elizabeth describes her escape, stating that she managed to reach the settlement to find it abandoned and in flames. Several times she came close to Indians but managed to avoid detection by hiding. After three days wandering through the devastated community, she was found by a group of settlers and taken to one of their homes at Conococheague settlement, where she was reunited with William.[14]\n\nCharles Stuart[edit]\n\nCharles Stuart was captured during the massacre and held prisoner until 1757. On his return to Pennsylvania, he wrote a lengthy statement of his experiences, probably intended for military authorities. The manuscript was published in 1926.[17]: 58 \n\nStuart and his wife, son and daughter were captured at Great Cove. In his account, he misidentifies the date of the massacre as 29 October, but provides a detailed account of his experiences. He states that his home was attacked by \"Delaware, Mingo and Shawnese\" warriors \"about 90 in number,\" who looted and burned his house and barn. Stuart says that Shingas led the attack on Great Cove, while Captain Jacobs and his warriors attacked the Conolloways. The warriors took Stuart with his family to join a crowd of \"19 other prisoners.\" A few of the older captives were killed, then the warriors escorted their captives and a large number of cattle and horses west towards Kittanning. On the journey, some prisoners were given away at several native villages. Two captives escaped by killing a guard, and the warriors threatened to kill Stuart in retaliation, but Shingas interceded on his behalf.[17]: 59–62 \n\nStuart reports a historically significant conversation with Shingas, who stated that he would have supported the British against the French, until hearing from General Braddock that \"the English Should Inhabit & Inherit the Land [and]...that No Savage Should Inherit the Land.\" When Shingas threatened to withdraw his warriors and his support, \"Gen'l Braddock answered that he did not need their Help.\" Shingas told Stuart he would be willing to support the British and live in peace if they would send weavers and blacksmiths to teach the Lenape to make cloth, gunpowder, and guns, and how to smelt lead and iron from ore.[17]: 63–65 \n\nThe Stuarts were taken to Kittanning where Charles was forced to run the gauntlet. The next day they were given to a Wyandot chief and sent to Fort Duquesne. The Wyandots then took the family to Fort Sandusky, and along the way Stuart's two children were given to native families. Stuart and his wife were then taken to Detroit, where they were sold to two French priests. Although the Stuarts were told that they could work to pay for their freedom, they were eventually sent to England in a prisoner exchange, and returned to Pennsylvania in 1757.[17]: 58, 66–81 \n\nAftermath[edit]\n\nFollowing the massacre, most of the settlers returned to Great Cove and the Conolloways. Raids continued on isolated homesteads,[2] but no serious assaults occurred until the following spring. By then many small privately-built forts had been constructed to protect settlers during raids, including Fort McCord in the Conococheague settlement, which was attacked and destroyed in April, 1756.[1]: 598–99 \n\nThe Great Cove Massacre and other attacks on Pennsylvania settlements prompted the provincial government to construct a chain of forts across the western frontier, and a second line of forts to serve as supply centers and a \"fall back\" line of defense, including Fort Augusta, Fort Halifax and Fort Hunter.[1]: 597  Fort Lyttleton was built to the north of Great Cove and Fort Loudoun just to the east. However, the unexpected destruction of the newly built Fort Granville in August, 1756 suggested that the forts themselves were vulnerable, and by then it had become clear that they were expensive to supply and garrison. The destruction of Kittanning in September, 1756 demonstrated that the colonists were capable of retaliation, and the Native American raids became much less frequent after the Treaty of Easton in 1758.[4]\n\nMemorialization[edit]\n\nMany victims of the massacre were buried at the Big Spring Graveyard in Ayr Township near McConnellsburg in Fulton County, Pennsylvania, where a historical marker notes their graves.[18]\n\nSee also[edit]\nPenn's Creek Massacre\nBattle of Sideling Hill\nCaptain Jacobs\nFrench and Indian War\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d e f g William H.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.\nFind sources: \"The Mask\" 1895 short story – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (December 2023) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\n\n\"The Mask\" is a short story in four parts published by Robert W. Chambers in his 1895 collection The King in Yellow. The story involves the themes of fantasy and alchemy, as well as art, love, and uncanny science, and contains the motifs of the King in Yellow. The main fantasy element in the story is a mysterious solution capable of turning living beings into marble sculptures.\n\nPlot[edit]\nPart one[edit]\n\nThe story opens with a excerpt from the fictional play The King in Yellow, Act 1, Scene 2d:[1]\n\nCamilla: You, sir, should unmask.\nStranger: Indeed?\nCassilda: Indeed it's time. We have all laid aside disguise but you.\nStranger: I wear no mask.\nCamilla: (Terrified, aside to Cassilda) No mask? No mask!\n\nIn his home in Rue Sainte-Cécile, Paris, talented sculptor Boris Yvain has completed works representing figures such as the Madonna and Cupid, and is working on a representation of The Fates. Through an unusual chemical process, he has also managed to produce a mysterious liquid that turns living beings immersed in it into pure marble representations of themselves. He demonstrates the solution to his painter friend Alec in an Easter lily and a gold fish, both of which are turned into beautiful white marble sculptures with azure and rose tints.\n\nAmidst discussions about Boris's sculptures and his reluctance to reveal this transformative secret to the world, as it would forever disrupt science and art, the dynamic between the characters becomes apparent, as there is an unspoken love triangle involving Boris, Alec, and Geneviève, Boris's lover who was also the model for his acclaimed Madonna sculpture. Geneviève's ever-changing moods and interactions hint at deeper emotions and tensions within the trio.\n\nPart two[edit]\n\nThe second part focuses on the daily life and dynamics among Boris, Alec, Geneviève, and their mutual friend Jack Scott. Boris continues his experiments with the transformative solution, accidentally almost dunking Alec into a pool filled with it. Later, Boris and Jack leave for an art exhibition, leaving Alec to work on a project for Geneviève's boudoir.\n\nAlec's artistic frustrations lead to a break, and he relaxes in the smoking room, eventually dozing off. He awakens to hauntingly sad music and discovers Geneviève weeping in the dark room, playing a spinet. Mistaking Alec's voice for Boris's, Geneviève, who had stumbled upon a wolf's head in the room and sprained her ankle, collapses in pain, revealing she is alone and injured. Boris and the household servants are absent, leaving Alec feeling guilty for not realizing earlier and offering assistance.\n\nBoris and Jack are still away in the following day, and Alec, concerned for her well-being, tries to help. He tries to reassure her with a small lie about the music, prompting Geneviève's gratitude. Eventually, Alec arranges for assistance and leaves Geneviève in the care of a maid.\n\nPart three[edit]\n\nBoris frantically tends to Geneviève as she succumbs to a mysterious fever. While she is taken care of, Boris, in order to distract himself from distress, turns yet another goldfish into marble with the transformative solution, and then decides to do the same to a white rabbit. Alec avoids witnessing this, and instead turns himself into reading the play The King in Yellow.\n\nStill feverish, Geneviève wakes up briefly and says Alec's name. While Alec is astonished by this, Boris tries to comfort his friend, saying \"It is not your fault, Alec, don't grieve so if she loves you\".\n\nAlec hurriedly leaves, taking Jack with him, and concludes he is going to be ill as well. He enters a long-lasting period of illness, with the last thing he remembers before it being Jack saying \"For Heaven's sake, doctor, what ails him, to wear a face like that?\", which reminded Alec of the Pallid Mask in The King in Yellow.\n\nAs two years pass, ill Alec is drawn into a period feverish delirium with terrifying hallucinations involving Boris, Genieviève, and motifs in The King in Yellow. He also recalls that Genieviève's words were actually \"I love you, but I think I love Boris best\". While he recovers, Jack takes care of him, and he repeatedly asks Jack to see Boris and Geneviève, but is never granted that request.\n\nBefore almost reaching full recovery, Alec wonders on his plans to meet Boris and Geneviève again, aiming to leave their lives forever afterward. However, Jack finally reveals that they are both dead. Alec, in a fit of rage, sinks into weeks of relapse, after which Jack, in a heartbreaking narrative, reveals what happened to their friends–Geneviève drowned in the pool after falling there under the influence of drugs, becoming a marble sculpture, and Boris shot himself in despair. Jack also tells Alec of his own meticulous actions to eradicate any trace of the transformative solution and the formula to produce it after the tragic events, as well as his work with a doctor to cover up the strange events. He then reveals Boris's will, which bequeaths everything to Geneviève, with the house and marbles left to Alec, and Jack entrusted with another property. Jack departs to fulfill Boris's wishes.\n\nThe devastating revelation leaves Alec shattered, realizing the finality of their intertwined lives and the profound tragedy that has torn them apart forever.\n\nPart four[edit]\n\nAfter inheriting Boris's house, Alec finally faces the haunting memories by returning to Rue Sainte-Cécile. However, overwhelmed by the silence and grief, he locks up the house and leaves for Constantinople, spending two years in the East trying to escape the tragedy. Yet, the memories of Boris and Geneviève keep resurfacing, eventually in letters from Jack, even though they initially avoided the subject.\n\nUpon Jack's urgent request, Alec returns to Paris, where they spend time together, visiting Boris's resting place at the cemetery in Sèvres. However, Jack's restless dreams and inexplicable anxiety prompt him to separate temporarily. Alec decides to move into Boris's house, now his, finding solace in painting but avoiding the marble room where Geneviève's body, now a fine marble sculpture, rests.\n\nOne April afternoon, drawn by an irresistible force, Alec finally opens the sealed door to the marble room. Bathed in sunlight, he discovers Geneviève lying under the Madonna's tender gaze, with a faint warmth beneath the marble. Overwhelmed, he kisses the marble and retreats into the house.\n\nAs he sits in the conservatory reading a letter from Jack, a maid interrupts, speaking of strange occurrences—a live rabbit replacing the marble one, and live fish replacing the marble ones. Frustrated, Alec investigates, finding the marble Easter Lily transformed into a fresh, fragrant flower. Suddenly understanding, he rushes back to the marble room. As the doors open, Geneviève, alive and flushed, wakes from her marble slumber, greeted by the heavenly smile of the Madonna.\n\nCharacters[edit]\nAlec: The story's twenty-year-old protagonist and first-person narrator. He is a painter who is in love with Geneviève.\nBoris Yvain: A twenty-three-year-old American sculptor of Russian and French ancestry, the lover of Geneviève and friend of the protagonist.\nGeneviève: A beautiful eighteen-year-old girl and Boris' lover.\nJack Scott: Another friend of the group.\nNotes[edit]\n^ \"The Mask\" in Chambers, Robert W.

He was also the progenitor of the Dukagjini family which ruled over an area of northern Albania and western Kosovo (Rrafshi i Dukagjinit) during the medieval period, their most important holding being that of Lezhë.\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nGjin Tanushi (recorded as ducam Ginium Tanuschium Albanensem and Johanes Tanusius) first appears in the historical record in an Angevin document from 1281 as among the Albanian nobles (including Vlado Blinishti among others) who had opposed Charles I of Anjou and were consequently imprisoned in Brindisi, having been captured by the captain (miles capitaneus) of Durazzo, Johannes Scoctus.[1][2] The title attributed to Gjin Tanushi in the document, duca (duke), may represent a position that he earned while serving as a military leader under the Byzantine Empire or Kingdom of Serbia. Following his return to Albania, Gjin Tanushi was killed by the locals of Ndërfanda. The death of Gjin Tanushi is discussed in an account written by Gjon Muzaka (fl. 1510) and contemporary oral traditions from the region. According to these narratives, Gjin Tanushi had killed the bishop of Ndërfanda at the church of Saint Mary as the bishop had dishonoured Tanushi by greedily looking upon his wife. Upon hearing of this, the locals of Ndërfanda rose upon against Gjin Tanushi and killed him as well as his entire household, with only a single son who had been hidden surviving the massacre. This unnamed son was adopted and raised by an ally of Tanushi named Stefan Progani from the village of Kallmet, who later married his daughter to Gjin Tanushi's son and aided him in retaking his fathers domain - re-establishing the Dukagjini as a power in the region.[3]\n\nWhile little is known about Gjin Tanushi's earlier life, some historians have theorised that he was a descendant or relative of the Progoni family which ruled the Principality of Arbanon from 1190 to 1215-6. Injac Zamputi proposed that Tanushi may have been a descendant of protosebastos Progon, the son of Gjin Progoni, who succeeded his uncle Demetrio Progoni and inherited lands in Ndërfanda.[4]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ Malaj, Edmond (2020). \"Lezha in the Middle Ages\".

Ken Rhee, who participated in the war as a foreigner for about 80 days, was accused of violating the passport law, was investigated by the police on June 10 after being quarantined to find out more about the charges, and most of the charges he committed were admitted.[11][12] The international criminal investigation unit of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency's Narcotics Crime Investigation Unit sent Ken Rhee to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office without detention on June 14. The police admitted to violating the passport law and did not investigate the \"pre-crime\" or \"crime of using explosives,\" which are applied when personally participating in other countries' combat actions, although they are likely to violate the passport law.[13]\n\nKen Rhee said that both knee cruciate ligaments were torn and he wanted to return to Ukraine after treatment. Ken Rhee said that while preparing to be punished for violating the law, he bravely fought on the battlefield by protecting people in the war as a volunteer army. During the war, not all volunteers receive citizenship, but the number of people who can receive citizenship is limited, and one of them is Ken Rhee himself. Nevertheless, Ken Rhee himself, who rejected his citizenship, is a Korean, so he said he would be punished according to the Korean court's ruling.[14][15] Ken Rhee said he reported and recorded war crimes, including the slaughter of civilians by Russian troops in Irpin while participating in the war in Київ and the South, and said that it would be a criminal act if he did not help Ukraine under such circumstances. Regarding his participation in the war in Ukraine, he said that it was his duty and \"the fight between good and evil\" to help Ukraine with a war against Russia, a powerful country that is different in character from other countries, which is a weak country. He said that the violation of the passport law was a traffic law[16], and that he made the right decision based on his belief, even though he knew he could be punished for illegal activities, and that he had no regrets at all.[17][18][19]\n\nSee also[edit]\nUnited States Navy SEALs\nRepublic of Korea Navy Special Warfare Flotilla\nReference[edit]\n^ \"- YouTube\". www.youtube.com.

It is preserved in the town's archaeological museum, opened in 1967.\n\nAlong with the famous Makthar harvester inscription unearthed in the late 19th century and preserved in the Louvre, the cippus is one of the few epigraphic documents found on this site to have been engraved with a poetic text.\n\nThis third century text evokes the memory of a deceased young woman. Despite the clumsiness of the wording, written in a provincial context, it provides information on the social and religious life of the town, and is a valuable insight into the Romanization of this part of Roman Africa and the integration of populations of Numidian origin at the end of the High Roman Empire.\n\nHistory[edit]\nAncient history of Makthar up to the 3rd century[edit]\nMap of the Makthar archaeological site, essentially inside the current archaeological park. Only partially corresponding to the ancient city.\n\nThe Beccut cippus is a funerary monument discovered in Makthar by site supervisor Herranz during the exploration of the Roman road leading from Makthar to Ausafa through the Wadi Saboun valley.[1]\n\nThe site of the town of Makthar, occupied in ancient times, was the seat of a powerful Numidian city allied to Carthage, which Masinissa seized shortly before the final fall of the Punic city in 146 BC at the end of the Third Punic War. The influence of Carthaginian civilization remained strong for a long time, as evidenced by the Neo-Punic stelae dating from the 1st century and found in excavations at the site known as Bab El Aïn.[2] From the end of the 1st century, the city benefited from Roman peace and experienced a degree of prosperity.[3] The institutions of the city, which became a free city in 46 BC, were permanently influenced by the Punic era, with the maintenance of three shophets until the beginning of the 2nd century. From that century onwards, triumvirates replaced them.[2]\n\nThe Romanization of the city began with some families gaining citizenship from the reign of Trajan, and others the equestrian rank during the reign of Commodus.[4] The old Numidian city had previously become a colony under the name of Colonia Aelia Aurelia Mactaris between 176 and 180.[3][5] The city's zenith came at the end of the 2nd century, during the reign of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, with intense civic activity and a surface area of over 10 hectares. In the 3rd century, it became the seat of a bishop[6] as the town's name is mentioned four times in lists of bishops from councils, including that of Carthage in 256.[7] The end of prosperity is dated to the end of the first third of the 3rd century with the restoration of the damage caused by the Crisis of the Third Century that took place after 285.[8]\n\nThe Beccut cippus dates from the years 250-260.[9] It evokes the memory of a young woman, Beccut, who died in her early twenties and was cremated according to local tradition.[10] The Makthar archaeological site has revealed fifteen funerary poems dated between the 3rd and 6th centuries, but the earliest ones date no further than the end of the Severan dynasty and make up a group of nine artefacts to which the Beccut cippus belongs.[11]\n\nDiscovery and study[edit]\nGroup of lapidary items in the Makthar Museum, including the Beccut cippus in the center.\n\nAccording to Jean-Marie Lassère, the study of the epigraphy of African monuments must be cautious because of the \"compartmentalized regions\": funerary customs and formulas spread in different ways.[12] The excavations at Makthar have yielded numerous figurative representations, all of which are useful for dating monuments. However, the form of the letters must be treated with caution, given the provincial nature of the work, which was carried out by \"unskilled country lapidarists\", and paleography is not sufficient for dating.[13]\n\nThe cippus was discovered in 1953,[14] published the following year (B.A.C., 1954, p. 120);[15] an in-depth study was published in 1970. The site revealed four other cippes in 1965.[1]\n\nThe area in which it was found contained numerous remains of monumental mausoleums.[1] The inscriptions found during the excavations reveal around 15% of the members of the college of local decurions in the second third of the 2nd century, and no members of the lower social classes.[16]\n\nDescription[edit]\nGeneral description[edit]\nCarved detail with a garland and a pinecone.\n\nThe word cippus is \"used too loosely in epigraphic literature\", etymologically meaning \"an upright stone\". The term is often used in the context of Roman Africa to refer to funerary monuments.[17] Funerary altars are often referred to as cippus in the literature.[18] The adoption of the funerary custom of altars instead of steles did not predate the 2nd century, at the beginning of the \"apogee of Africa\", and spread massively in the following century.[19]\n\nThe Beccut cippus is of the arulae-pillar type.[9] It is carved from limestone and measures 1.60 m (5.2 ft) high by 0.45 m (1.47 ft) wide and 0.55 m (1.80 ft) thick.[1] The upper part is broken on the right.A1\n\nThe cippus features a large area of text, above which is a degraded garland and a pinecone.[1] The garland carved in stone reproduces the garlands \"hung on tombs on the occasion of celebrations\". The altar was adorned before sacrifices,[20] in particular those linked to the festival of Rosalia.[21] This Roman funerary festival was introduced to Makhtar when the town became a colony.[21]\n\nInscription[edit]\nGeneral view of the part of the cippus bearing Latin inscriptions.\n\nThe cippus features a 22-line inscription and, below it, the word \"Euthesia\",[14] outside the frame.[1] The last four lines have gaps.[14] The artifact is the only stele with a known verse epitaph, apart from the Makthar Harvester epitaph,[22] the \"most famous Mactar inscription\".[9]\n\nThe shape of the letters, which do not fit neatly into the listed categories (uncial, Roman cursive, etc.), led Jean Mallon to describe this as a new school of paleography, \"marking the advent of modern Latin writing\".[23] Jean Mallon has carried out a comparative study of the cippus script and that of an Oxyrhynchus papyrus, in particular no. 668, which contains an epitome of Titus Livius and was found in 1903. The manuscript has been dated to the 3rd century, and Mallon suggests the birth of writing in what is now Tunisia.[24] The calligraphy used by the lapidarist is three times larger than on the scroll and \"the proportions are exactly the same\".[25] The inscription is chiselled \"in the graphic style of a contemporary book\".[26]\n\nThe first line of the text and the last two are typical of such funerary monuments, but in between is a poem of ten hexameters.[14] The text contains prosodic errors, and the author of the inscription appears to be an \"improvised poet\", according to Édouard Galletier.[27]\n\nBeccut speaks in the text.[28] The two lines giving the deceased's full name are badly damaged.[16] The inscription form includes an \"abbreviated invocation to the Manes\", the name of the deceased and his age.[29]\n\nFunerary inscription\n\nD*M*S*\nBECCVTIAMPRÍ\nMVMILONICONIVNCTAMA\nRITO\nVIRGORVDISTENERAQVOME\nFORTVNAREDVXIT\nVITAESETLETISEDESSICFATATVLERE\nHICHYMNOTEDAQSIMVLPRAEEVN\nTECANEBAR\nNVNCVVSTISVRNAQSIMVLCONTECTA\nRESEDI\nVIXIDVMLICVITMORVMSINELABEPVDICA\nMATERNVMNOMENFECILVCINAEFA\nVORE\nNATVMPROGENVINOSTROQVINO\nMINEVIVAT\nNEFLEATHOCNIMIVMCVISVMCARISSIMA\nCORDI\nCOMMVNEESTHOMINVMFVNEBREM\n[..]ERELA[......]\n[....]L[....]EIA[............]\n[..]RISSIMAPIAVIXITANNISXV[....]\nEVTHESIA[30]\n\nBody\n\n|D(iis) M(anibus) S(acrum)\n|Beccut iam pri|mum Iloni coniuncta ma|rito\n|uirgo rudis tenera quo me| Fortuna reduxit\n|uitae set leti sedes sic fata tulere\n|hic hymno tedaq(ue) simul praeeun| te canebar\n|nunc uustis urnaq(ue) simul contecta | resedi\n|uixi dum licuit morum sine labe pudica\n|maternum nomen feci Lucinae fa| uore\n|natum progenui nostro qui no|mine uiuat\n|ne fleat hoc nimium cui sum carissima | cordi\n|commune est hominum funebrem |[qu]erela[m.....]\n[....]l[...]eia[............]|[..]rissima pia vxit annis XV[....]\nEuthesia[31]\n\nEnglish translation\n\n\"I, Beccut, first united with my husband Ilo (?), a novice and youthful virgin, in the place where Fortuna led me, the dwelling place of my life, but also the place of my demise - so the Fates willed - here I was celebrated both by the Hymen and by the nuptial torch carried before me, now I lie buried both in the tomb and in the urn.

May he not weep too much over my fate, he to whose heart I am so dear: it is the human condition to have to weep over the dead (?).\"[1]\n\nThe end of the text cannot be translated due to gaps in the stone or the term used, \"Euthesia\"; the precise age of the deceased is one of these gaps.\n\nInterpretation[edit]\n\nSacrifices cannot take place above the monument's table due to its height, even though it is carved in the shape of an altar.[32]\n\nA comparative study of the pillar altars found on the archaeological site by Gilbert Charles-Picard suggests that the Beccut cippus dates the death of Makthar's harvester after 260, while the epigraphic study notes that \"the writing is not identical\"; the harvester died at an old age and his ascension may date from the city's period of prosperity, between 210 and 235.[9]\n\nMakthar social study document[edit]\n\nPeregrines, after obtaining Roman citizenship, kept their \"barbarian name\" as their cognomen.[33] In the evolution of the Roman name over the course of the 3rd century, the praenomen gave way to the cognomen, \"the only personal name used in everyday life\".[34]\n\nThe main interest of the cippus is onomastic. Beccut is the cognomen of the deceased, indicating a Punic or Libyan origin.[10] It would be the feminine form of the name BG'T, Bogud,[10] a princely name.[15] The deceased may have had two cognomina, one in Latin and the other in the native language. The husband's cognomen may have been Milo.[16] The cognomen of African origin can be seen, in the words of Jean-Marie Lassère, as \"the revenge of indigenous tradition, relegating the gentilice, symbol of Romanization, to the shadows.\"[35] As for the husband's name, ILONI, this is not explained by the Punic language, and specialists suggest the reading MILONI due to haplography, the dropping of one of the letters. The cognomen Milo was prestigious and its attribution to his son is possible by \"a provincial scholar.\"[16]\n\nAlthough the document gives no information on the couple's social position, it is assumed that they belonged to the city's \"well-to-do bourgeoisie.\"[16] The senatorial and equestrian families were not easily distinguishable in the city, and the Curiate was open to people of modest means \"by dint of hard work.\"[36] The cognomen Beccut betrays a \"recent promotion.\"[37]\n\nDocument about a member of a religious community[edit]\nDetail of the lower part of the cippus with the word \"Euthesia\".\n\nThe invocation of the dead man's name was important because, according to Ausonius, it made it possible to \"bring the dead back from oblivion for a moment and mingle him with the living.\"[34]\n\nThe term \"Euthesia\" evokes a religious community.[10] The city's wealthy social classes honored Magna Mater and Liber, and Bacchism is reflected in the greater presence of Dionysiac symbols on funerary monuments, such as a pine cone on Beccut's cippus. However, the latter is used as much for the cult of Saturn as for the Magna Mater or Liber.[37] Beccut may have been a Bacchante, and \"Euthesia\" may have been one of the \"mystical vocables\", the Eu prefix \"belonging to the technical language of medicine.\"[37] The signum on the monument is perhaps a sign of membership of the Isiac community. Although the cult is little known in Makthar, initiation elsewhere is possible. The cult of Dionysus and Osiris may have come close, according to a \"commonly accepted assimilation.\"[38]\n\nThe cult of Isis imposed on its followers \"a severe discipline, even to the point of asceticism\", and Beccut's epitaph accords with these principles of life.[38] The word \"Euthesia\" at the end of the inscription introduces \"an atmosphere of strange mystery.\"[38]\n\nFunerary poem[edit]\n\nThe text of the cippus is of the encomium type, and the poet evokes \"banalities and clichés\": \"Beccut was modest and had a son.\"[10] Lucina is an epithet of Juno, \"tutelary goddess of childbirth.\"[39] Evoking feminine virtue in the text is \"traditional praise\". She was born,[39] lived and died in the same place.[40] \"Married very young\", she did not die in childbirth because of the allusion to divinity, nor because of an accident: illness undoubtedly took her, \"in a manner as banal as it was distressing.\"[39] The lifespan indicated, Vixit annos, is mostly found on monuments dating from the 2nd or 3rd century.[41]\n\nThe expression DMS (Diis Manibus Sacrum, to the sacred Manes gods) is stereotyped.[39] However, the use of the invocation to the Manes gods, early on the African monuments of the Proconsular capital or Dougga, is late \"as one moves away from Carthage.\"[42] Consolation is a \"commonplace theme.\"[39]\n\nThe verse study reveals \"no emotion\" on the part of the husband, who according to Gilbert Charles-Picard \"must have been in a hurry to remarry.\"[10] The poem's style \"is characterized by its banality, both clumsy and pompous\". The language is described by Charles-Picard as \"artificial\" and having nothing to do with the language spoken by the local population.[39]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\tAncient Rome portal\n\tAfrica portal\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d e f g Charles-Picard, Le Bonniec & Mallon (1970, p. 128)\n^ \nJump up to:\na b Lipinski (1992, p. 270)\n^ \nJump up to:\na b Slim & Fauqué (2001, p. 105)\n^ Collective (2006, p. 300)\n^ Charles-Picard (1954, p. 74)\n^ Collective (2006, p. 301)\n^ Prévot (1984, p. 4)\n^ Charles-Picard (1954, pp. 76–77)\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d Charles-Picard, Le Bonniec & Mallon (1970, p. 148)\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d e f Charles-Picard, Le Bonniec & Mallon (1970, p. 149)\n^ Charles-Picard, Le Bonniec & Mallon (1970, pp. 148–149)\n^ Lassère (1973, p. 8)\n^ Lassère (1973, p. 10)\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d Charles-Picard, Le Bonniec & Mallon (1970, p. 125)\n^ \nJump up to:\na b Camps (1991)\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d e Charles-Picard, Le Bonniec & Mallon (1970, p. 150)\n^ Lassère (1973, p. 11)\n^ Lassère (1973, p. 65)\n^ Lassère (1973, pp. 122–123)\n^ Charles-Picard, Le Bonniec & Mallon (1970, p. 131)\n^ \nJump up to:\na b Charles-Picard, Le Bonniec & Mallon (1970, p. 132)\n^ Charles-Picard, Le Bonniec & Mallon (1970, p. 146)\n^ Charles-Picard, Le Bonniec & Mallon (1970, pp. 157, 162)\n^ Charles-Picard, Le Bonniec & Mallon (1970, pp. 157–158)\n^ Charles-Picard, Le Bonniec & Mallon (1970, p. 159)\n^ Charles-Picard, Le Bonniec & Mallon (1970, p. 164)\n^ Charles-Picard, Le Bonniec & Mallon (1970, pp. 153–154)\n^ Charles-Picard, Le Bonniec & Mallon (1970, p. 153)\n^ Lassère (1973, p. 22)\n^ Charles-Picard, Le Bonniec & Mallon (1970, p. 126)\n^ Charles-Picard, Le Bonniec & Mallon (1970, p. 127)\n^ Charles-Picard, Le Bonniec & Mallon (1970, p. 144)\n^ Lassère (1973, p. 15)\n^ \nJump up to:\na b Lassère (1973, p. 23)\n^ Lassère (1973, pp. 23–24)\n^ Charles-Picard, Le Bonniec & Mallon (1970, pp. 150–151)\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c Charles-Picard, Le Bonniec & Mallon (1970, p. 151)\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c Charles-Picard, Le Bonniec & Mallon (1970, p. 152)\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d e f Charles-Picard, Le Bonniec & Mallon (1970, p. 155)\n^ Charles-Picard, Le Bonniec & Mallon (1970, p. 154)\n^ Lassère (1973, p. 127)\n^ Lassère (1973, pp. 123–126)\nBibliography[edit]\nCamps, Gabriel (1991). \"Bogud\".

She is best known for The Problem with Work: Feminism, Marxism, Antiwork Politics and Postwork Imaginaries, published in 2011 by Duke University Press.[1][2]\n\nBiography[edit]\n\nShe holds a PhD from the University of Washington, and is currently a Professor of Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies at Duke University. There, she was from 2012 to 2015 the Director of Graduate Studies in Women, and in 2018 the Director of Graduate Studies in the Program In Gender, Sexuality & Feminist Studies.[3]\n\nIn 1998 she published Constituting Feminist Subjects,[4][5]and in 2000 she co-edited with Michael Hardt the volume The Jameson Reader, on cultural theorist Fredric Jameson. She gained prominence with the publication in 2011 of The Problem with Work: Feminism, Marxism, Antiwork Politics and Postwork Imaginaries.[6] The book uses Marxist social reproduction theory, including Wages for Housework and autonomist literature, to question that work is necessarily a social good.[7][8][9] She argues in favor of a post-work society where people do not see their creativity or political agency bound by employment relations. This includes a defense of a universal basic income on Marxist feminist grounds.[10][11][12]\n\nBooks[edit]\nAs author[edit]\nConstituting Feminist Subjects (Cornell University Press, 1998).

She was a professor emeritus of University of Silesia in Katowice.\n\nEducation[edit]\n\nKowalska received a master's degree in chemistry in 1968 and a PhD in physical chemistry in 1972, both from Higher Pedagogical School in Katowice, which became University of Silesia in Katowice. She conducted post-doctoral research at University of Salford in the UK, under the supervision of Hans Suschitzky. She received a habilitation degree in 1988 from Maria Curie-Skłodowska University, with the habilitation dissertation titled A New Thermodynamic Model of the Chromatographic Process and its Applications.[1][2][3]\n\nCareer[edit]\n\nKowalska was professor emeritus at the Institute of Chemistry of University of Silesia in Katowice, where she began her career in 1968 as assistant professor, associate professor (since 1991), and full professor (since 2000). From 2004, she headed the Department of Physicochemical Foundations of Chromatography at the Institute of Chemistry, which was renamed to the Department of General Chemistry and Chromatography in 2006.[1][2][4]\n\nOver her career, the research topics of Kowalska focused on chromatography. She co-authored over 300 peer-reviewed publications on the topic[5] and co-edited five chromatography books: Preparative Layer Chromatography (2006),[6] Thin Layer Chromatography in Chiral Separations and Analysis (2007),[7] Thin Layer Chromatography in Phytochemistry (2008),[8] Planar Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (2015),[9] Chromatographic Techniques in the Forensic Analysis of Designer Drugs (2018).[10] In 2017, the International Symposium for High-Performance Thin-Layer Chromatography called her \"the First Lady of chiral TLC (Thin Layer Chromatography)/HPTLC (High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography)\".[11]\n\nTo address the lack of comprehensive chromatographic journals, Kowalska founded Acta Chromatographica with Józef Śliwiok in 1992. In addition to Acta Chromatographica, she also served on the editorial boards of Journal of Planar Chromatography and Chromatography Research International.[2][12][13]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b \"In memoriam Professor Dr Teresa Kowalska (1946–2023)\".
