From the first vehicle, Syed Zardan Shah came out and Syed Yazan Shah came out of the second vehicle. Zardan waited for Yazan standing next to his car. They both walked into the main entrance of the mansion that led them to the residential building where no men were allowed except the family members.\"Bari bibi! Chote Shah Sahb or Yazan Sahb ayain hain\" One of the oldest servants informed Bano, the wife of Fazal Shah.(Ma'am! Mr. Zardan and Yazan has arrived)\"Alhamdulillah\" With a bright smile on her lips she walked outside of her room to the living area where the two heir of the family just reached.\"Aslamo alaikum!\" Both men greeted her.\"Walekum salam! Walekum salam\" She said happily walking towards them.\"Ama! How are you?\" Zardan Shah moved closer to his mother with open arms.\"I am fine. Alhamdulillah. What about you? You took so many days to came back\" She complained to her son.\"I was busy in his admission and the other important work related to business\" Zardan politely answered his mother and pointed towards Yazan.Yazan was recently enrolled in a bachelor's program at University. He was living in hostel since class 9th. After enrolling in university, Zardan has bought a small apartment for his use where Yazan was living with a servant.\"Dekho zara bache sy to main mili hi nahi\" Bano mentally slapped her head and turned towards Yazan.(I forgot to meet him)\"Kesi hain ap tayi ama?\" Yazan quickly walked to her and bent his head a little down in front of her. She patted his shoulder with a hint of happiness in her eyes.(How are you auntie?)\"I am fine. Tell me about your admission\" She asked sitting on the large sofa.\"The classes have already started. It was weekend so I decided to came back home\" Yazan explained with a little smile on his face.\"You did right\" She nodded.\"How was your first week at University?\" She asked with interest.\"It was very good\" Yazan told him with a little smile. He couldn't say more words. He wasn't used to. He liked silence more than anything else.\"I wanted you to take admission in the near by city. You could live in the Haveli then but Zardan and Fazal had a different plan. I don't understand what difference is made by you taking admission in a city that is 5 hours away from our village\" She didn't seem happy about him still staying far away from home. Although he had stayed in the same city for many years now.\"Ama! All universities aren't same. He is enrolled in the one of the top universities of Pakistan\" Zardan said proudly, patted Yazan's shoulder in appreciation.\"I don't understand your point of view\" Bano mover her hand in the air.\"Bhai jan ap a gae\" A voice full of life echoed in the Haveli and a young girl entered the living room. Her eyes found her dear brother. She rushed to him excitedly. (Brother you have arrived)Her duppata lowered and uncovered her hair. Bano mentally cursed her daughter for her irresponsible behavior.Yazan Shah quickly lowered his gaze to the floor. He couldn't dare to look at her in this condition. His gaze was fixed at the floor.Zardan Shah rose up from the sofa and opened his arms for his little sister. The girl wrapped her arms around his back. Zardan kissed her head lovingly and put her duppata back on her head, covered her hair.\"Mera bacha you were missing me\" He asked softly.(My child)\"No\" The girl giggled, setting her duppata on her head on her own.\"I was waiting for my gifts\" Zardan laughed on her words.\"Mano bili! Bhai ki koi fikar nahi tumhain bus tohfay chahie. Or tohfay bhi kiya farmaishain thin apki\" Zardan slightly slapped her head not to hurt her.(Little kitten! You have no worries for your brother. You were only worried for your gifts. And these aren't even gifts you asked me to buy them)\"Yes! Yes! You are absolutely right\" She nodded her head excitedly with a bright smile on her face.\"Gandi bachi\" He chuckled at her response.(Bad girl)\"I have got everything my sister asked for. Later in the evening, I will hand over your things to you. Happy!\" He sat down on the sofa telling her.\"Happy\" She giggled.\"Sharam karo Zartasha! Yazan bhi yahan betha hua hy. Ussy kon Salam kare ga\" Bano averted her attention to the young man sitting next to her brother whom she completely ignored at first.(Have some shame Zartasha! Yazan is also sitting here. Who will greet him)\"Ohh. Aslamo alaikum! Yazan bhai\" Zartasha passed a little smile to him.\"Walekum salam Zartasha! I am fine. What about you?\" Yazan looked at her for a moment and then lowered his gaze again.\"Happy\" She chuckled.May Allah give you all the happiness of the world, Yazan wished for her in his heart.\"Bus bus. Zartasha! Kamre main jao ab. Koi haya nahi hy is larki main Zardan! Bht bigar diya hy tum ny isse\" Bano complained to her son unhappily.(It's enough now. Go back to your room Zartasha. She has no shame. You have made her like this Zardan!\"Zartasha stared at her brother on her mother's words like he was the one who said that. He blinked his eyes at her said to his mother.\"She is innocent. Don't say like that\" \"Innocent? She isn't innocent. Sab ki nani hy ye\" Bano glared at her daughter pointing towards the room.(She is a trouble maker)Yazan Shah placed his hand on his mouth to hide his smile.∆\"Zartaj!\" Bano's loud voice echoed in the Haveli.\"Zartaj!\" She was agitated now as the person who she was calling wasn't responding to her.A woman dressed in a white frock and pajama laid down on a deewan, opened her eyes on her name but a moment later she closed her eyes again.Her white chaddar was lying on the bed.Her thick curly hair was sprawled over the head of deewan. Her face was devoid of makeup and any kind of jewelry. She was dressed so simple.She looked simple but her facial expressions were hard. She opened her eyes to stare at the ceiling. Her eyes were filled with fire like she had anger in them. Her expressions didn't match her personality.She looked like a simple woman.A simple soul.A pure soul.But was she? Her expressions and her eyes were telling a different tale. A tale which wasn't easy for anyone to hear, which she never told anyone.دل مرا کب کا ہو چکا پتھرموت تو کب کی ہو چکی میریاب تو برباد کر چکے، یہ کہوکیا اسی میں تھی بہتری میریDil mera kab ka ho chuka pattharMaut to kab ki ho chuki mairiAb to barbad kar chuke, ye kahoKya isi mein thi behtari mairi?\"Behri ho kiya\" Bano muttered unhappily as she reached Zartaj's room.(Are you deaf)Zartaj didn't reply her. She kept looking at Bano. She didn't ask for what purpose Bano was calling her. She kept lying at deewan in the same position.\"Don't you have any shame. I called you for hundred times and you didn't even bother to reply. And what the hell are you busy in? Staring at the damn ceiling\" Bano couldn't control her anger.Zartaj faced her anger without any response.\"Answer me!\" Bano was mad at her.Zartaj didn't reply. Bano knew she wouldn't say anything. She would be lying there staring at her for the whole day but she wouldn't utter a word.Everybody knew about Zartaj's stubbornness.\"Zardan a gaya hy. Jao Salam karo ussy ja kar\" Bano asked her gently this time.(Zardan has arrived. Go and meet him)Zartaj rolled her eyes on his name. She didn't want to see him. At least not anymore. She closed her eyes and rested her arm on her eyes.Her wrists and hands were also devoid of any jewelry.Bano silently watched her for a few moments before leaving her room in agony.∆Zartaj looks mysterious.Zartasha looks like a lively girl.What do you think about the chapter. Story is still unclear i know. It will develop in the next few chapters.Don't forget to vote✨"}

Got stuck with some personal work.Hereafter the updates will be regular.So, vote and comment for regular updates.Author's pov:It's been a month since their marriage. Murtasim kisses her often, they cuddle each other and sleep. Meerab has resumed her college, and with the help of Murtasim, Meerab is slowly recovering from her mother's loss.Murtasim's pov:Today, I am in my home office, and I am missing my baby so badly. She has not yet returned from college.I got attached so much to her that I just want to keep her with me all the time. But that's not possible.Suddenly the door opened, and my princess walked in.I said,\" Hey baby,come here.\".She came to me, and I pulled her onto my lap.She stiffened a bit and got relaxed.I nuzzled my face against her neck and inhaled her fragrance deeply. I am so addicted to her smell.She smiled and hugged me tighter. I pulled her closer and kissed her neck.I slowly moved my face towards hers, and I couldn't control seeing her innocent eyes and her inviting lips.I placed my lips on hers and started kissing her slowly and sensually. I sucked her lower lip and gently took her upper lip between my teeth. She started kissing me, copying my action; she fisted my hair tightly and pulled me closer.I detached my lips from her when I felt she was out of breath. I peppered her face with kisses, and she giggled.I looked into her eyes and said,\"I missed you, baby girl.\"She smiled and buried her face in my neck. I chuckled and hugged her tighter.She said,\" I missed you too, Hukum.\".I hugged her even tighter and asked,'How was your college?\".She looked at me and said,\"It's going  well. I have many assignments to complete for tomorrow.\"I tucked her hair behind her ears and asked,\"Did someone bother you at the college? A guy?\"She got shocked and asked,\"How did you know? Are you spying on me, Hukum?\".I chuckled a bit and said, \"No,I am not spying on you, princess. I have my men around you, and I got to know from them. Your safety is important to me. So, I have hired them.\"She sighed and kept her head on my chest and said,\"It's okay, Hukum. I understand. And by the way, I have told that guy that I am married. And you know what? His face became sad, and he called me sister after that. Poor boy, but I didn't say that I was married to the king of Rajasthan. If I say that, he would have a heart attack.\".She looked at me and giggled.I caressed her cheeks and said, \"Hmm. If someone bothers you hereafter, you should tell me, baby. Okay?\".She smiled a little and said, \"Okay. You have not gone to the office.\"I kissed her forehead and said,\"I was waiting for you, My Jaan. I have an important meeting in an hour, and I will be leaving now. Eat now and have some sleep. Then you can do your assignment. Got it, baby?\".She smiled and said, \"Okay.As you say.\"I got up with her in my arms and walked towards our bedroom. I made her sit on the couch, went to the bathroom, got changed, and went to the office, not before pecking her lips.Meerab's pov:Hukum has left. I ate and took some rest, and now I am doing my assignments for the past few hours.Time flew by, and it's 8 p.m., and Hukum has not yet returned. So I decided to call him.Meerab- Hi Hukum. Aap kahan ho?Murtasim- Jaan, I will be coming late; I got stuck with some important work. Please have dinner and sleep, princess.My smile faded, and I said a simple \"okay\" and ended the call.I completed all my assignments and went down to have dinner. I spent some time with Maa, and now I am back in my room.I am missing him, and I can't sleep without cuddling him and sleeping. But I have to go to sleep as I have college tomorrow. So, with great difficulty tossing over the bed for more than half an hour, I drifted into sleep.Murtasim pov:I was supposed to attend a meeting and go back home to my princess. But I got stuck with some underground stuff. We have got the men who has leaked our project's important information to our enemy. We caught him today, and he got his well-deserved punishment. So, I got late today.I slowly opened the door of my room, and there my princess was sleeping on the bed with her baby hairs on her forehead and a small pout on her lips.I went to the washroom, got changed, and got in the blanket beside her. I slowly removed her baby hairs from her forehead and kissed her forehead gently.My inner beast is craving more of her. My princess is innocent, but she is making me take cold showers every night. My desire for her is so passionate, and I don't want to hurt her with my passion.I gently took her in my arms, and she snuggled more in to me, craving the warmth.She mumbled slowly, \"Hukum\".And I know that my baby has missed me a lot.I slowly kissed her nose and her chubby cheeks. I gently pecked her small pout.But I want more. So, I took her lower lips and sucked them gently, and she sucked my upper lip slowly in her sleep, and I groaned. She took my lower lip and sucked it for a few minutes, and I let her do what she wanted.After Sometimes, I slowly detached myself from her lips, and she whined, not feeling my lips on hers. I chuckled, pecked her lips, and patted her head gently. She drifted to sleep.I slowly excused myself from her, took a cold shower, and went to her and hugged her to sleep.God knows how many cold showers are in my fate."}

Ang paraan ng pagpipino ng tableta ay matagal nang nawala! ”Nanginginig ang katawan ni Yvonne habang tulalang nakatitig kay Darryl.Wala siyang masabi kahit isang salita!‘Si Darryl ay palaging napakahusay sa pagbibigay ng mga kaaya-ayang sorpresa...

The only thing she's ever told me about them was that they wanted her to have the fairytale life and she just wasn't into it. According to her they were the worst people on the planet but then again I feel like everyone views their parents that way when they're tired of being told what to do and how to act. \"Who said I wasn't gonna behave?\" I watched as she shot me a suspicious look before busting out in a fit of laughter She was right. Our personalities couldn't be any more different than they already are. Fyn was the non confrontational friend; she hated drama and would much rather let things slide than say that she was uncomfortable or unhappy. She was the type of girl who got boy crazy and would tolerate the most despicable things just to keep her man happy. In my mind she was delusional but in reality she had been sheltered so much that she's not exactly street smart. I on the other hand was extremely vocal about anything and everything; Nothing got past me and I never let shit slide. I felt that if a person could disrespect you and cross your boundaries at least once then they'd do it again if they had the chance. My Mom has always told me that I only seen the worst in people but in reality I see things for what it is. Once we were both ready we got into Fyn's car and she started to drive \"Pretty weird that a high school game starts this late\" I said as I looked at the time on my phone \"Cleo he's 27, he doesn't play for a high school\" she laughed as she drove Now I was beyond confused because where the hell were we going then?I just sat back and enjoyed the ride until I noticed that we weren't that far from the spectrum center \"So what's his name and how come you've never mentioned him before ?\" I asked attempting to make small talk\"His name is  Jaylen and we were at odds for a while but we've gotten closer over the last 6 months\" she replied as she continued to drive Now I don't know shit about basketball or the players except for the well known people like Micheal Jordan, Kobe, and shaq.I've never watched any other the games either because that wasn't something I was into and I was hesitant to even come today but Fyn seemed excited so I wanted to be there for her. I relaxed as she parked the car This was the Lakers stadium so I knew they had to be playing but I'm pretty sure she would've told me that her cousin played for our home team...I'd also assume that she'd care enough to at least watch the games on TV\"What team is playing tonight?\" I asked as we got out of the car \"Boston Celtics\"I wasn't familiar with them at all but as I looked around I noticed a lot of people with green jerseys on Majority of the jerseys had the number 0 on the back with the name Tatum so I assumed whoever he was had to be a fan favorite\"Is his last name Tatum?\" I asked as we walked towards the doors \"No, Brown.. he's friends with Tatum though\" she stated as we headed inside I nodded as she scanned in our tickets and we walked through the metal detectors I'd only been here one other time before with my dad and my sister..I was 8 and she was 10 at the time We hit the concession stands for something to eat before heading to our seats; We were literally right behind where the players would sit!I never questioned how much the seats cost since I already knew that Fyn came from a wealthy family. Although they didn't see eye to eye they made sure she lived more than comfortably and had everything that she needed Fyn also worked at the club with me so it wasn't like she didn't have a job that provided her some extra cash I got on Wattpad and continued to read my Lil Mosey fan fiction while Fyn texted on her phone When the lights went low and the music started I put my phone away and sat up\"There he is\" she said as a bunch of guys started to walk out of the tunnel areaI had no clue what he looked like so I didn't know who she was even pointing to until he walked over to where we were sitting He was cute but nowhere near my typeThey talked for like 3 minutes before she introduced me to him I just smiled and waved since there wasn't anything to really say to him My eyes found there way to number 0 who was talking to another player I could only see the back of his head but the tattoos on his leg caught my eye I loved tattoos and You could tell that he paid a pretty penny for it because it was extremely detailed and well drawn He also seemed to have a large back tattoo that extended to his shoulder I don't know why I was studying that man's body like a weirdo but I silently hoped that he walked over here so I could ask him who the artist was\"aye JT!\" Jaylen called out I watched as number 0 turned around Now I'm not the boy crazy type by any means but damn he was beautifulI watched as he jogged over  and Jaylen quickly introduced us to him He smiled as he talked to Fyn. His smile was perfect and by the sound of his voice I just know he'd talk you through it I zoned out and just wallowed in my thoughts for a while debating with myself about if and how I'd shoot my shot \"What about you?\"  He asked snapping me out of my thoughts \"Sorry, what?\" I asked as I looked over at him He was now sitting down with the rest of the team and now had a regular green Celtics shirt on \"I asked if this was your first game too..\" he said as he looked at me\"Uh no, it's my second\" I watched as he smiled and nodded Fyn: \"hopefully you guys win\" she smiled as she batted her eyelashes I know that was her sign of flirting so I pushed the whole shooting my shot plan to the back of my mindWasn't like I had a chance anywayThe game was beyond boring except for the little intermissions they had which reminded me why I didn't come to games in the first place The only reason I hadn't fallen asleep was because of how loud it was The lakers ended up winning by like 2 or 3 points and I was ready to take my ass homeI had work tomorrow so I planned on calling it a night and getting an Uber home...that didn't end up happening thoughJayson said he was gonna to head back to the hotel but Fyn invited him to hang with us and he took the offer\"If the plan is the club then I can't hang, I've got work tomorrow\"I yawned\"We can get food and chill at my house instead if you guys want\" Fyn suggestedBoth Jaylen and Jayson agreed for privacy reasons which I completely understood so that's what we didSurprisingly the guys were cool and down to earth. I don't know why I assumed that they'd be stuck up or rude\"So where do you work?\" Jayson asked as he turned to me\"Ace Of Spades\"\"You dance?!\" Jaylen asked as he sat up and started at meJayson had a look on his face which was a mixture of curiosity and disbelief\"No, I'm a bottle girl\" I said as I shook my head\"And She's a crowd favorite\" Fyn smiled as she tapped my legShe was a bartender because she refused to wear the uniform for bottle girls...it was basically next to nothing and she was a shy girl so I understood\"That's only because I'm like the only bottle girl who doesn't throw myself at the men who come there\" I shrugged\"And That's because you're used to being around people of high status\" Fyn nodded\"No, I just see people as people regardless of how much money they have or had...at the end of the day we're all buried in the same dirt\" I shrugged as I laid back in my seatI was starting to get sleepy and was ready to turn in for the night\"I think I'm gonna call it a night\" I yawned as I ordered an UberEverybody nodded and Fyn walked me to the door once my ride came; she waited until I got in the car before she went back insideI couldn't wait to take a shower and go to bed!(I LEFT THE @ ON THE MEDIA PICTURE IN CASE YOU GUYS WANTED TO FOLLOW THEM OR KNOW WHO PLAYED WHICH CHARACTER!!!!

Sadly, Lila is one of those returning students and is secretly the new holder of the butterfly🦋 miraculous wants to ruin Marinette's life by causing people to get akumitized👁‍🗨by her on purpose! I hope you like it, Enjoy!*It's the first day of school, and everyone is back including Lila Rossi or Cersi. Sadly no one knows about her double life😔and that she's the new holder of the Butterfly🦋Miraculous. She hid behind a wall watching returning/new students walking in and heading to the Assembly located in the gym, including Marinette and Adrien. But when she saw them while saying💬to herself. \"Show time,\" Lila said softly for dramatic effect with a wicked smile. At that moment she knew it was time to begin phase one of her plan... Lila got out of her hiding spot and talked to one new student as she told \"Amy Lindsey\" lies about Marinette to make her look like the mean, liar, manipulative girl of the whole school and the new girl believed the things Lila were saying were \"true\" since she was naïve, too trusting and kind hearted to her own good. *At the school Assembly**In the gym* *8:30 a.m.* Everyone was waiting patiently for Principal Damocles while talking in the audience until it started... moments later, he came out walking up to the podium to start the School Assembly by saying. \"Welcome students, to our new and improved School! For those of you who don't know me... I'm your Principal, \"Mr. Damocles\" and I would like to welcome back returning students from *last year* cause this semester will be different.\" He said introducing himself and informing all of his students about the new improvements Mrs. Bustier made in her first act as the *new mayor of Paris* just months ago, in the Summer🌅for the school. He added. \"I would like for us all to take a moment of silence... a month ago, Gabriel Agreste helped Ladybug🐞defeat Monarch🦋and he died a \"Hero\". Principal Damocles said softly mentioning Mr. Agreste in his speech in honoring him as one of Paris's greatest heroes. Adrien nodded and smiled at Mr. Damocles for saying those nice, thoughtful kind, words about his father. He appreciated it very much! Marinette's eyes widened in shock at the mention of \"Gabriel Agreste\" since she was the only one who knew he was Monarch and no one else did. Well, except for Lila😅. Speaking of, she was watching the assembly from a distance from the crowd so no one would notice her when things got really \"Negative\" or suspect her... responsible for causing Amy to be Akumitized even though it was all her idea. And not even Marinette could stop Lila! Then suddenly her brooch hidden under her jacket glowed bright purple sensing a powerful emotion... Just as she suspected it would! Which meant that her the scheme was going as planned. And now it was time for the next phase in her master plan. Then, she heard the cries of someone in pain crying tears💦of sadness🥺with a little touch of fear😰. \"Perfect timing, now it's time to spread some fear,\" Lila said satisfied as she looked at everyone heading out of the gym to an area for her to transform✨into LadyMoth🦋to akumitized👁‍🗨 \"Amy\". As she did just that! Transformed into her villainous self and was excited to get started... and said💬to herself for dramatic effect while taking an Akuma out of her staff to turn Amy Lindsey into a Supervillain. \"Come here, my little Akuma. And turn this poor girl's sadness into her greatest weapon for revenge on Marinette Dupain Cheng! Or should I say Ladybug🐞,\" Lila🦋said evilly with a wicked smile holding the akuma in the palm of her hand ready to release it in akumitizing the new girl. Then, the Akuma🦋flew out of the locker room and headed towards Amy in the *art room* where she was crying😭her heart❤️cause she felt like she didn't fit in and was feeling homesick. And then it went into her blue crystal necklace as Ladymoth💟spoke💬into her head. \"Ultra Violet, I'm Ladymoth. I want to help you get revenge on the person who caused you such sadness by giving you superpowers to destroy Marinette Dupain Cheng! But only if you get me what I desire the most... and that's Ladybug🐞's earrings and her partner🐱's ring. So, do you accept my offer?\" Lila said villainous speaking into Amy's head while trying to trick her into getting what she wants for making the ultimate wish without telling her the truth cause she's an manipulation evil liar who only thinks about herself and no one else. Talk about selfishness!\"I accept your offer, Ladymoth,\" she said wickedly accepting this offer as she glowed purple turning into a SuperVillain with the power of ultralight energy to destroy Marinette without knowing that she was a good person. And Lila was the real victim here corrupting the poor girl's mind with her twisted lies.  \"Excellent!\" Ladymoth🦋said excitedly with the satisfaction of her plan coming together as planned. *An hour later*Mr. Damocles was just about to finish the Assembly when he was interrupted by an energy✨wave of ultrasonic light🔆burst that hit him and everyone causing them all to fall on the ground in pain and then a female supervillain showed up in a purple, black, white suit on the scene holding an ultra blaster in her left hand while cackling with a wicked smile. Which meant she was responsible for this mess! Marinette and Adrien were on the floor and gave each other looks that they needed to transform right away to save the school with the help of their friends if needed... \"I'm Ultra Violet, so tell me, Teachers and students Where is Marinette Dupan Cheng?! Ladymoth demands it! Or else I will level this city... starting with this school!!\" She shouted out angrily😡in a threatening voice of destroying the school if no one told her where the person she was looking for was. \"LadyMoth?\" Marinette and Adrien questioned softly in unison looking at one another in confusion. This meant that someone found the Butterfly🦋miraculous and she was using it for evil to get her hands on their miraculous. Like usual. Alya added. \"Well, that's a new one,\" she said softly to her bestie stating the obvious and continued on saying💬. \"Do you need our help or can You🐞and Cat Noir🐱 handle this?\" Alya asked out of curiosity if they needed Rena🦊Rouge and Carepace🐢's help to fight this akumitized villain. \"No, I think we got this one. Alya, but thanks!\" Marinette replied softly whispering into her bestie's ear letting her know that she and Cat Noir got this. After all, they have done before, I think they'll be fine😅. So, Marinette and Adrien quickly ran together hand-in-hand through the chaos while trying to get to the locker room to transform into Ladybug🐞and Cat Noir🐱to save the day like they used to when Hawkmoth/Shadowmoth/Monarch terrorized the city months ago. Then, they made it inside as Tiki🍀and Plagg🐾flew out of their school bags for their owners to transform. \"Spots on! Claws out!\" They said out loud in unison and then transformed together as one... Pink🩷, red🔺, black⬛️, and green🟢combo of colors🌈surrounded them into their new suits representing their true selves! Marinette and Adrien as Ladybug🐞& Cat Noir🐱opened their eyes at the same time looking at each other and seeing their new suits because of how they had grown so much over the past few months as \"Partners\" together since Hawkmoth, Shadowmoth, Monarch, and even right now Ladymoth💟🦋whom they knew nothing about. Just like before at the start... but this time they're not alone cause firstly they have each other❤️💚and secondly, they have a team of miraculous holders to help them face this new big bad/threat when needed their help in battle. \"Wow, You look amazing! Milady,\" Cat Noir🐱said lovely with excitement and commenting on how beautiful his girlfriend looks in her upgraded new suit. \"Yeah, you're right! And so do you. Kitty,\" Ladybug 🐞said sweetly with excitement looking at her suit while commenting on his too with passion. \"So, shall we? Bugaboo,\" Cat Noir🐱said flirtatiously with a lovely smile on his face. She smiled. \"Yes, we shall. By the way, now that I know it's you, Adrien, I like it when you call me that.\" Ladybug🐞replied softly loving when he calls her that now. *An hour later*ladybug🐞and Cat Noir🐱were in trouble but that's when Rena🦊and Carepace🐢stepped in at just the right time to help their friends... \"no SHELTER!!!\" Carapace yelled out loud using his power to protect LB and Cat Noir from getting hurt by the ultraviolet light blast. \"Well, I guess you did need us after all. LadyBug,\" Rena said heroically as she held her fox flute ready to use. \"Thanks, Rena.\" LB🐞said grateful for her friend She smiled twirled in her hand and then began to play it beautifully✨and said the magic word. \"MIRAGE!!!\" Rena shouted out as she released an illusion orange beam of light creating an distraction for the element of surprise for Marinette aka Ladybug to come up with a solution to how to stop this Super villain from destroying their school And where the akumitized object is... \"LUCKY CHARM!!!\" Ladybug🐞said \"An She looked around her searching for a way on how to use this device to save the day as usual \"NO!!!\" Lila shouted out inside her locker that she failed to get the miraculous🐞🐱.\"Damn it! That wretched bug, dumb cat, This is not over! Not yet. I know I was planning on revealing myself later on. But now is the time for action if I want to succeed... and I will do it,\" Lila said in frustration to herself as Ladymoth and banged her staff on the ground for dramatic effect as an swarm of butterflies surrounded her and teleported her where Ladybug and her team of heroes are... \"I am the new holder of the butterfly🦋miraculous! The new hawkmoth. And my name is \"LadyMoth\" I'm your And mark my words Ladybug and Cat Noir... I will get my hands on your miraculous! To make the ultimate wish that changes the world🌎for worse than ever. This is an warning for you two and your team of heroes to step down"}

The door was opened by none other than his father. That father who hated the girl who was now with his son. No, he doesn't hate Ishani for any personal reasons infact he hates her because his son is in love with a company employee.He shouted:\"Mr. Yug Rathore, what are you doing? \"Both Yug and Ishani looked towards the source of voice. Yug:\"Dad, why are you shouting?\"Dad:\"What? I am shouting, what are you doing inside this room with a girl? That too your employee\"Yug:\"Dad, what are you saying? I don't understand anything. She is my love\"Ishani:\"What? \"Yug:\"Yes babydoll\"Ishani:\"babydoll? Are you saying you're in love with me?Yug:\"Haa... Babydoll\"Ishani:\"No way\"She giggled by touching his nose. He too touched her nose and giggled.Yug pretended to play a guitar and Ishani started to sing a song while pretending to have a mic in her hand.Dad:\"Both of you are high on bhang. \"He called Meera and Shravil to Yug's room. Both of them reached there. He said:\"Meera, handle this girl and You, Shravil, handle Yug. Both of them are high on bhang. I don't want any trouble here. Take this girl to guest room. I'll let Vijay to bring lemon juice for both of them.\"He left the room. Meera:\"See, Shravil.... Your uncle is very angry with this act. Now, let's try to bring them conscious. \"\"wait a minute, aunty. \"By saying this, Shravil went near the portrait and took a phone which was kept hidden in the plant pot.Meera:\"Shravil, you even kept a recorder in Yug's room\"Shravil:\"Yes, Meera aunty. We alsi should know what had happened between them. Whether they had confessed their feelings or not. \"Meera:\"Let's check it later. Now let's bring them conscious. I'll take Ishani to guest room. You look after Yug.\"      Meera took Ishani to guest room and gave her some lemon juice. After a while, Ishani and Yug started to come into their true sense. Both of them in their respective rooms said to Meera and Shravil:\"Oh my god, my head.... It's hurting so much\"Meera and Shravil asked them to rest for a while and leaved their rooms. Ishani while resting\"What happened? Why is my head hurting so much? \"She got some flashes of her interactions with Yug during the period she consumed bhang. \"What had happened? Did I consume bhang? But how? And why can't i remember anything properly?\"         Yug in his room thinks\"What had happened? Wait a minute..... Shravil.... It was him. He did something. Yes, he had mixed cannabis in my drink. Bur what happened afterwards? I'll teach this mischievous boy a lesson. \"Yug stood from his bed and went towards Shravil's room.      Here, in Shravil's room, Meera aunty and Shravil are watching Yug and Ishani's crazy acts on the phone. They were laughing. Meera:\"Both of them had did a lot of crazy things. What will happen when Yug watches his own behavior 😂😂\" Yug came there and said:\"What? What are you guys watching? \"Shravil and Meera aunty startled and stood from the bed. Suddenly, Yug heard a voice from the phone 'Dad, what are you saying? I don't understand anything. She is my love\"\"What? \"\"Yes babydoll\"\"babydoll? Are you saying you're in love with me?\"Haa... Babydoll'             Yug came near the phone and snatched the phone from Shravil. He watched the entire video from the beginning.\"Shravil, what did you do? Why did you mix Bhang in our drinks?\"Shravil:\"Thank me Bro, because of me you confessed your feelings. \"Meera:\"Haa son, But we don't know whether Ishani has same feelings for you \"Yug:\"But dad is really angry. Don't you think he will try to do something against this? \"Meera:\"Don't worry, Yug. Ishani will capture his heart like she did with ours\"Yug:\"I trust her in that case. But Shravil, what you did was really a mischievous act\"Ishani:\"What kind of mischievous act did he do? \"Shocked, Yug turned towards Ishani and said:\"Nothing, he is like this from childhood. Every now and then, he will do something to trouble others\"Ishani:\"Well, that's not a bad thing. He is filling his life with fun and happiness\"Shravil came near Ishani and said\"Thank You bhabhi.. \"Ishani:\"Bhabhi??\"Shravil:\"I mean... Ishani. It was a slip of tongue\"Ishani:\"Anyway, I'm leaving. I didn't realise how much time i had spent here. It was a great party. Thank you for inviting me here.\"Yug:\"I'll drop you home \"Ishani:\"No, Sir. It's not necessary. I can manage myself\"Yug :\"But. It's late. \"Ishani:\"No thank you\"Yug:\"I don't want to hear a no from you. It's already too late. I'll drop you\"Ishani:\"You are truly the best boss who looks after the safety of all your female employees\"Yug took Ishani near his car and opened the door for her. Then both of them left for Ishani's house. Yug's father was watching everything from afar. He thinks\"I don't want my son to date an employee. I must do something. I'll do something tomorrow to humiliate her in front of all the business investors and then Yug will understand the true standard of this girl. \""}

Beyond all the exuberance and jubilant congregation, sat a sighing Samaya on the green, dull bench throwing stones in the water fountain nearby.  Exhausted by the bustling lives of the cities and exasperated by the choices of the audiences,  she was in no mood to be a part of the bliss around her. She fidgeted with her pen and pondered over her life choices as a writer. She looked at her phone to remind herself of a humiliating dinner with her family tomorrow at Christmas, where her career choices would be disparaged and her financial stability would be questioned. Huffing, she got up, pulling her grey coat up to her ears and rubbing her mittens. She headed to the shop for gifts on the other side of the road, preparing her mind in advance for the next day. The doors of the 'Chapel All in All Shop' jingled and a sweet aroma filled Samaya's nose. The shop was sparkling with decorations, it was gleeful to stand there. She felt good for a moment but recalled her day, and soon a frown rested on her face. She got rejected by a writing company, 3 book shops refused to take her published books, and her sister in the name of Christmas called to bluff about the new promotion she got at the Software company. With a crestfallen face, she was busy filling her cart with stockings, gift cards, holiday food, candies, and champagne when a boy in his late 20s walked up to her with a beautiful eye-smile, and greeted, \"Happy Christmas\". She looked up and replied, \"Thank you, Happy Christmas to you too, May I know you?\". \"I'm Noah, I've read your book and I must say, I'm a fan.\" he chimed. \"Oh! I'm very grateful for that. Well how may I help you?\", she said, shocked to see the reader recognise her. \"Honestly, I just came up here, recognising you as the profound writer, whose notions are different than everybody else's, plus, it's Christmas, so you know\", he smiled. \"I see\", she said, turning her cart and putting a candy cane. \"At least someone does read that crap\" she whispered to herself, looking down. \"Well, Noah it was pleasant meeting you, I think I must take my leave. Happy Christmas and Happy Holidays,\" she said turning ahead. \"Thank you, It was pleasant meeting you too. Here's my business card, if you're interested, I'm the owner of the \"LiveBlog\", he said handing her a black card. \"Th-he famous writing one?\" she stammered. \"Yes, ma'am, I am guessing I'll be seeing you soon then\". He replied and left. Samaya was flabbergasted, she stared at the card for a good amount of time. She was shocked at the fact that someone finally realised her potential, and also at the fact that she had something to brag about the next day, to show her parents and smug siblings that her writing was worth something. That was something that brought a pleased smile to her face that evening, and probably the beginning of total turn, her life was about to take. Hey readers (if there are any), hope you liked this part... It's my first story, thought of writing something different and short. Would appreciate some support!! Thank you. "}

Panic gripped me as I scrambled to gather my books and uniform. With a quick breakfast, I dashed out, stepping into the bright, inviting morning on the charming road from the boarding house to the school.On my way, I bumped into a senior, (my roommate) from the upper grade, who seemed to breeze through mornings effortlessly. \"Hey, good morning!\"\"Mornin'! First day jitters?\"\"You bet! This school's like a maze.\"Ah, but it's a maze we've mastered! You'll learn the shortcuts soon enough.\"\"I hope so! This place feels like a puzzle.\"\"That's the fun part! Like a game, you know? Finding ways to bend the rules a bit.\" \"Bend the rules? How?\"\"Well, let's just say, we've got our ways to make even the boring school system a bit more interesting. You'll see!\"With a cryptic smile, he strolled off, leaving me both curious and intrigued about the adventures this seemingly mundane school might hold.As we approached my classroom, my roommate chuckled, \"Alright, this is your stop. Remember, you got this!\" I thanked him with an innocent smile before stepping into the chaos of the class. The classroom buzzed with energy, students chatting and laughing, completely absorbed in their own worlds. Some boys playfully shoved each other, while a group of girls huddled together, their laughter piercing through the room.Their teasing wasn't always kind, and it seemed they didn't even notice me, the new face in the room. Amidst this chaos, I spotted an empty desk near the window and hurriedly claimed it, seeking refuge from the frenzy. Amidst the commotion, I noticed her—the girl who saw me slip yesterday, peacefully engrossed in a book with earplugs in. In my mind, I wondered about that moment of awkwardness and how I'd face her from now on.As the class began, the teacher introduced me to everyone. The girl who saw me slip yesterday smiled, teasingly, but I just grinned back awkwardly.The class was peaceful for a moment, but then the bell rang, and it was over. After class, I mentioned it to my roommate, and we joked about how this school seemed to work with strange rules that made no sense.\"It's like they want us to figure out a puzzle without any clues,\" my roommate chuckled. \"Just wait, you'll get used to it.\"I laughed, feeling a bit better about the crazy start to my day.As I headed back to class, I witnessed a tense moment between [that girl] Soo Ji and a boy. The boy seemed insistent on something, but Soo Ji refused, shaking her head calmly. Abruptly, the boy's voice rose aggressively, echoing through the hallway.  \"Why's he getting so worked up? It's none of my concern, but why am I even paying attention? I should just focus on my own stuff.\""}

I haven't spoken to Lisa, and as far as I know she's back with the girls two days after we last saw her, at the studio. I'm still keeping my promise to give her time, and I've been pretty busy studying lately and haven't had much time to distract myself.It's about 5 a.m. in New York and I just got on the plane. I'm expecting a 6-hour flight to Arizona, so I'll try to get at least another three hours. I can't wait to land, see my parents and go outside, where the temperature will be about 30 degrees, not like here, where they are currently -4.Naomi's coming home tomorrow morning, so I won't see her today, but we're going to spend two weeks together and I'm happy about that.In about five minutes we took off. I played music on my headphones and leaned comfortably. I tried to sleep, but I didn't get it. I had already been awake, and I hadn't even had coffee just to get some sleep during the flight. After a while, a flight attendant passed by to offer passengers a drink or something to eat. I ended up ordering a cappuccino and a sandwich. I still listened to music until one of Lisa's songs started. I had recently come across an article about this song and speculation was that it was for Park. I stopped the music and took off my headphones.\"Here you come for your cappuccino, your sandwich, and the latest issue of Vogue magazine,\" he serves me the stuff. I saw that she was giving out the magazine to everyone. I was about to take a sip of my coffee when I noticed the cover of the magazine they had distributed to all the passengers. There was an image of Lisa and Rose from a new photo shoot. I decided to look at the magazine, and there I saw their ad for the new Adidas collection. It was just a short text that described them as an amazing combination and emphasized that no one else could present this collection in a way that they did. For now, I just closed the magazine and flipped it around to see the back cover.4 hours laterIt was almost 9 a.m. here in Arizona, and I just got off the plane. Now I just picked up my luggage and headed to one of the airport exits where my parents were supposed to meet me. When I saw them, I ran joyfully to them.\"Vicky!\" they called and hugged me.\"I missed you very much!\" I said, and after a while we separated from the embrace.\"You too!\" replied Mom.\"How was the flight?\" Dad asked me, taking my suitcase as well as the jacket I was carrying and we headed for their car.\"Okay,\" I replied, though I wasn't sure if that was true or false.\"Aren't you hot?\" Mom pointed to my winter jacket that I had put on. She was wearing a summer dress, and Dad was wearing a T-shirt and shorts.\"In New York at night it was -4 degrees. I couldn't come in shorts.\" - I laughed. My father left my luggage in the trunk and the three of us got in the car. We headed home.\"How does it feel to come back here?\" Dad asked, looking at me through the mirror.\"Nice! In fact, I'm even more excited now to be here than when I traveled. Somehow summer time just makes me happier, I don't know how to explain it. Winter in New York is very depressing.\"\"Now you're going to enjoy the warm weather for two weeks,\" Mom assured me.We talked about different things all the way home. When we entered our neighborhood, it was somewhat reassuring. I was home, I felt like I was in my place. I really didn't realize how much I missed it here. We finally stopped in front of our house. Everything was the same, just the way I like it.\"Welcome home!\" my dad opened the front door and I walked in first and they followed. My dad took the stuff up to my room and my mom and I went to sit on the couch in the living room.\"Are you hungry?\"\"No.\" I shook my head.\"Something to drink then?\" suggested Mum.\"Do you have any homemade lemonade?\", I asked her.\"Of course!\" she smiled and got up from the couch. He went to the kitchen.\"Girls, I'm going out and I'll see you for dinner. \"Dad came down from upstairs. He was wearing a tuxedo.\"Wait! Where are you going? I thought we were going to spend the day together. \"I got up and went over to him.\"My vacation starts tomorrow and I'm at work today. I'm sorry honey, I tried to sneak out so I could see you, but I just don't have a choice.\" she smiled sadly.\"So... what do you want to do today?\" my mom asked, handing me a glass of homemade lemonade. - \"We can go for a walk outside, go shopping, go to the pool or stay in.\"\"I'd rather stay home today. We can sit in the garden and talk,\" I suggested.\"Okay.\" she agreed.\"Just to get up and change. I'll be right there,\" I said, and she went out into the backyard and I went upstairs. I walked into my room and looked around. Everything was as I had left it. I decided not to open the suitcase now and look for clothes, but to get some from the wardrobe here. I decided to wear a floral summer dress, I hadn't worn a dress recently and it was really hot outside so it seemed appropriate. I also put on my sandals and tied my hair in a high ponytail. I picked up the phone and went downstairs. I went out to the yard and sat next to Mom on the wooden bench in the garden.\"Now tell me how it is in New York, how are the lectures, any boy?\" he grinned.\"I like New York, I definitely didn't get disappointed, the lectures are interesting and I didn't make a mistake with my choice to study fashion design, I've always liked that. Boy...\" maybe now was the time to tell her about Lisa. I've been meaning to do it while I'm here and it's convenient that Dad isn't around right now. Not that I won't tell him, but I'd rather talk to Mom about it first.\"I'm listening.\"\"Well... if I told you you wouldn't believe it,\" I laughed.\"Vicky. . . ?\" she raised an eyebrow and looked at me strangely.\"It all started back in the summer...\", I started to tell her. At first she was quite surprised, but she believed me. Well, I had to show her a few pictures of us and some of our chats, but she still believed it. But she also thinks I need to figure out what I want, or rather both of us need to figure it out, because after all Lisa confuses me sometimes too. Maybe I'll call her these days. We need to talk.\"\"You both need to figure out what you want, because it's important anyway.  Don't worry about the challenges, they make us stronger.\"Then we sat on the bench, hugged, and continued to talk. In that moment I felt that my mother was by my side, supporting me in my new endeavors and in the love I found in Lisa.It was a relaxing evening, but not for me. My parents were already asleep, but I still didn't feel like sleeping. I went into my room and took a shower to refresh myself after the long day. Then I put on my pajamas , which consisted of shorts and a tank top, and settled on my stomach in bed. I turned on my laptop and started looking at stuff on Twitter. Lisa had shared a few photos from her photo shoot. Should I call Lisa right now? But maybe it's too late. I doubted he was sleeping. Still, maybe it would have been better not to rush. Although it's been two weeks... Despite these musings, I picked up my phone. I thought for a moment, but finally dialed her number. No one picked up the phone. I understood her. I decided to just go back to my bed. I didn't want to look at social media. I needed a break. During these days here in Arizona, I wanted to focus on my family, friends and of course, me.А/БHappy Holidays to all"}

THE OWNER OWNS ITS COPYRIGHTS. )3 years later... It was our graduation ceremony. We all had gathered at the auditorium in our campus, eagerly waiting for our degree. I sat beside Aashika holding her hand. \"Are you nervous?\", Aashika whispered in my ears. -\"No.\" I said in a quivering voice as I nodded my head in denial. \"Then what's this,\" Aashika said as she signaled with her eyes to my hand which clutched onto hers. It trembled, her hand felt quite warm which made me realize that my palm was getting cold. \"Nothing,\" I said with an awkward smile. \"Hey, just take it easy. Everything will be great. You were the class topper, what's there to worry about? I didn't even study much and here I am sitting with full confidence. So, just chill and take it easy. Okay?,\" she said, her smile beaming with warmness. She didn't say much but it was more than enough to soothe my anxiety. I think it was the stage, the large number of people which intimidated me. As you'll know I'm an introvert so it's in my nature. But, over with it and let me gain a bit of confidence. I closed my eyes, tried calming my mind and clearing my thoughts. I can do it... Everything's fine... You won't mess it up...It's just a matter of a few seconds on the stage so calm down Aashna, okay?A deep breath in... A deep breath out...Breathe in... Breathe out... Breathe in... Breathe out... And now I was beaming with confidence. Just kidding, it surely did feel better but it wasn't anything like that. As the students came in, we sat haphazardly. It was almost thirty minutes until the ceremony began. Nearly all students had arrived so we were made to sit accordingly. I looked around searching for Parth, he wasn't here yet. A professor of our faculty came by and asked us, \"Nervous?\". \"Yes Ma'am, a bit,\" Ronit replied. \"And the rest of you?\", she said with curiosity. We looked at each other with looks of anxiousness on our faces and nodded in approval. \"Don't worry, everything will just work out fine. I was even nervous when I was at my Graduation Ceremony. It'll end even before you'll realize so make as many good memories as you can now, they'll stay in your hearts forever. But where's Parth? Does anyone know where he is?,\" Ma'am asked.\"Ma'am, he just texted me. He'll be here soon,\" Ronit said. \"Okay, that's good,\" she said and walked away. The seat beside me was empty. The ceremony was just about to begin when someone came and sat down. I turned around and saw it was Parth. \"Hi,\" he said in his soothing voice. A radiating smile on his handsome face. Indeed, a sight to behold... I couldn't stop staring at those alluring lips which curved into a smile. A drop of sweat on his temple slowly trickled down. He was so close to me. I could only imagine touching those delicate features of his face with my fingers, which looked even more attractive with the drops of sweat trickling down. Those enchanting eyes, seductive lips and gorgeous face. I felt as though my heart stopped for a few seconds. But one moment... Did I just fantasize over my sister's boyfriend? Like seriously? What's wrong with me? These stupid feelings are again out of control or maybe it was just my hormones getting worked up? Whatever it is, I don't care. What I care about is, this is wrong, very wrong and it should just stop. Interrupting my series of thoughts was his voice. \"Gosh, I'm sweating too much,\" he complained as he wiped those drops of sweat from his face. \"Were you running?\", I asked. -\"Yeah, of course,  I...\" \"Why? You're so early, you should have taken your own sweet time,\" I said, teasing him. \"Hey, did you just make fun of me?\", he said with a baffled expression. \"No way, why would I do that?\", I said as I giggled softly. \"You won't believe the traffic was so slow and it felt like it took ages to reach here from my house,\" he complained. \"I think you shouldn't blame the traffic for waking up late.\" -\"How did you know that?\" He said, a bit surprised by my statement. \"I just know you very well,\" I said, bringing my face a bit closer to his. \"And... you must have binge watched a series last night?\" I continued. \"Okay, fine, you're right but... are you sure 'you know me very well',\" he said as he brought his face even closer to mine with only a few inches left. The gap was less... I could feel his warm breath fanning my neck... As his cologne filled my nostrils, awakening a tingling sensation deep inside me... I couldn't prevent my eyes from gazing at his face, from his forehead to his eyes, his nose and his lips... those lips attracted me the most. Those thin, alluring lips. I just couldn't move my eyes from them. He brushed his tongue on his lips making it wet. It looked so seductive that I couldn't think straight and even if I could, I didn't want to. I want to feel those lips on mine, discovering every inch of it. I wonder how I'll feel if those lips devoured mine and touched every inch of my body. It must be heavenly. I wish I could feel that pleasure. There was a slight tension building between us. My heart thumping against my ribs as I could almost hear my heartbeat, maybe he could too. -\"A very good morning to everyone present here. It is my immense pleasure to welcome you all to the Graduation Ceremony of Sapphire League University, one of the most prestigious universities of India. A very warm welcome to our respected chief guest...\" A feminine voice grabbed our attention. We turned our faces in the forward direction, only to notice the ceremony had started. Everyone had arrived, the students, their family and friends, the faculty members, the board members, the other guests and also the chief guest. We got back to our original posture and concentrated on the stuff going on in front of us. He could concentrate but it was quite a struggle for me. I kept my hand on my chest and realized my heart was still pounding. Let it be... It can't be helped... I sighed as I knew I was totally hopeless. It had almost been an hour of boring speeches going on. It started with the emcee giving an introductory speech followed by individual speeches by the chief guest, other respectable guests present, the Chairperson, the Chancellor and the Vice-Chancellor. God knows what they were saying so much. Umm.. anyways, as if I care... Now, the main event starts. The students were asked to stand in a line and wait for names to be called out to receive our certificate. \"First, I would like to call onstage the student who has made all of us proud with an exceptional academic score, graduating on the top of her class with the highest GPA, Aashna Chopra graduating from the Faculty of Law. Can we have a big round of applause for her,\" the emcee said. I couldn't believe what I just heard. Was it really true? I pinched my hand to check whether I was dreaming, but to much joy I wasn't and this was true! So, yes, my hardwork has finally paid off.The efforts I made for the past three years weren't in vain. The joy and happiness I felt was beyond everything. The satisfaction you feel when you achieve one of your goals is what I exactly felt. Although this doesn't mean I'll stop here, this is just the beginning and there are a whole lot of things I want to accomplish and I will. I climbed a few steps to get on the stage. My heart throbbing with happiness, excitement and nervousness. I stepped forward completing my journey from a graduand to a graduate and went over to the Chief guest, the Hon'ble President of India to receive my certificate. \"Congratulations,\" he said as he handed over the certificate to me. I replied to him with a smile,\"Thank you\", which was almost a murmur as I was so nervous that my voice wouldn't come out. As I held the certificate, I felt ecstatic. I looked forward with a big smile on my face which was proof of how delighted I was. The huge number of people who sat in the auditorium clapped and cheered for me. My mother who was sitting in the front row had stood up and was clapping for me. Tears in her eyes, a wide smile on her lips and the expression on her face screamed of the fact that how proud she felt for her daughter. The claps and cheers of the people and also the shutter sound of the cameras filled my ears. Those feelings and emotions which I felt were far beyond explanations. I shook hands with the guests onstage who congratulated me for my achievement. As I moved on, I stood in front of my father (he's the Chairperson). A warm smile on his face and he gently patted my shoulder as he said,\" Well done, my dear. Keep up the good work.\" \"Yes Dad, I will,\" I said with a smile. Those few words of appreciation meant a lot for me. It made me feel content. I have always wanted to make my parents feel proud of me and yes, this was the moment. In my board exams I couldn't be first in the national rankings for a few marks. But this time I made it. Yesss! I did it. My parents were so happy and proud. What else can I ask for? I got down from the stage after shaking hands with the Chancellor, the Vice-Chancellor and a few other people. \"Congratulations...!!,\" Aashika exclaimed as she ran towards me and tightly embraced me. \"Didn't I tell you that you'll make it,\" she continued with a smile as we broke the embrace. -\"Yes, I know and I also know that you'll do great too.\" -\"Congrats.\" I heard a familiar voice from behind. It was Parth. I turned and yes, it was him. We shook hands and I replied, \"Thanks,\" with a smile. Ronit, Lisa and my other friends came along and were congratulating me. \"Quite everyone. I know you all are happy for Aashna but we're in the middle of the ceremony so maintain the decorum. Go back to your places in the line and Aashna, congratulations,\" one of our professors said. It was silence once again here and only the announcements being made and the clapping of the audience was audible. Everyone returned back to their places. -\"Thank you Ma'am.\" -\"You can go back to your seat or wait here if you want.\" -\"Ma'am, I'll just wait here for my friends.\" \"Fine, as you wish,\" she said with a smile and went away. All the students were handed over their certificates, followed by a congratulatory speech by the Chairperson and closing remarks by the emcee. Then, a moment of intense happiness as we launched our caps skyward which was followed by five minutes of chaos as we searched for our caps. What a mess! \"Hey, did you get yours?\" Lisa asked. \"No, I just can't understand which one's mine, all of them seem to look the same,\" I complained. \"Just pick up any, honestly all of them are the same so who cares,\" she said. \"Are you serious!\" I exclaimed. \"Of course, look I just picked this up,\" she whispered in my ears while showing the cap she held. \"Look at others, everyone's almost settled, do you think all of them got their own ones?\" she continued. \"Of course,\" I replied. \"How come you don't get it? Urghh...,\" she said, totally frustrated with me. \"I give up, I'm just settling with this, you can continue your search for the rest of the day,\" she said as she sat down with the cap in her hand. Okay, so, should I just take whichever I get? Maybe I should... I picked a random one and sat down. The ceremony ended and we walked out of the auditorium. It was totally crowded outside, everyone with their families. As my eyes scanned through the lawn, I could see proud parents giving their children presents, friends hugging each other for the last time and promising to reunite every year no matter what, clicking pictures and making memories. But... Where's my family? Why can't I find them? I was about to make a call to my mom when I heard Aashika's voice. -\"Aashnaa... We're here.\" As I looked at my right side, I could see Aashika at a distance. She waved her hand, a smile on her face as she shrieked, \"come here..\" Mom, dad stood beside her, a smile on their faces as they looked at me approaching. \"Come here darling, let me give you a hug,\" mom said as she spread her arms wide. I ran over the little distance and tightly embraced her. \"So proud of you my daughter,\" she said, gently stroking my head. \"Thank you mom, love you,\" I said as I softly pecked her cheek. -\"Love you too dear.\" Her voice expressing the deep love she has for me. \"Dad! Are you crying?\" Aashika exclaimed. \"No way! It's just... It's nothing... I mean...\" he sniffled, wiping those few drops of tears. \"Raj, stop lying. I've known you since years and you still get emotional over everything. Come here, let me give a hug to both of you,\" she said as hugged the three of us. \"It's just that my little daughters have grown up so much. It feels like yesterday that they were born and look, today they're graduating,\" he said in a voice soft with affection. It was such a heartfelt moment. An embrace filled with so much love, affection and warmth. Mom, dad, Aashika... the people I love the most. They are my world, my source of happiness, basically my everything. Someone might think we were reuniting after ages if they saw us now. But who cares about that. I thought we might always stay the same. The love we shared, the bonding we had, everything would remain the same. I knew nothing could separate us. Nothing. But I was wrong. Very wrong."}

The traffic is never-ending, like the rivers of one' mind, with people moving with no sense of purpose, like leaves drifting aimlessly in the cold, stale wind.The man always has the same dull routine: he wakes up to the same old alarm clock buzzing like a dying fly.*Bizz! * *Bizz! * *Bizz! *The man wants to stay in bed but knows he must work, must eat the same old food, must live in the old, decayed apartment, and must live on the empty, polluted streets.If not, where does the man live? The man can't go back to home; home is gone; home was destroyed in a fire, a fire caused by the man's ingratitude. The man couldn't forgive himself for losing his only sense of pride.The man got up from his withered bed, creaking as if urging him not to leave, but the man drags himself out of bed, seemingly not wanting to face the morning. He heads to the bathroom, dirty and matted with mold. He showers and brushes his teeth and puts on his clothes—the same clothes he wears to work every day and the same ones he sleeps in—he heads to his job, not before being greeted by the littered ground, the dull gray sky, and the quiet yet loud streets.The man takes the bus to work. The bus stop itself has been neglected for years now by the city, filled with trash and cigarette buds. The bus arrived, the man got on and it moved. The bus was the same usual overcrowded bus it is, people were glued to their phones, ignoring gum stains, ripped chairs, and dents on the bus. The man stands and waits for his bus stop in the overcrowded bus, just barely having enough room for himself.Once the bus arrives at the man's stop, he leaves and heads to his job. His job was simple yet the most mundane: typing his life away at his computer, answering emails, making dull reports, and attending dull meetings. Once the man is done, he goes home by the same bus, to the same apartment, and to the same bed.However, this rainy day was different, the man was given a day off. A day off? why? The man was confused as to why, he thought he didn't deserve it but didn't question it further. The man headed back to the bus stop, but just before he did, something caught his attention, it was bright lights, colorful signs, and cheery people. The man was curious about what they were doing. The man wondered why the people were so cheery in this weather, but before he knew it his body moved on its own as if wanting to know more. Eventually the man reaches the bright lights, he had never seen so many colors before, seeing the vibrant blues, greens, and reds fill the surroundings around him. It was like being in an oil painting. He felt something he hadn't had before. What was it? The man wonders why, before he can understand why, someone yells behind him.\"Hey!\", The man turns only to see a young woman. She continues, \"Yo, welcome to the color festival! Is this your first time here?\"The man is confused. Someone is talking to me outside of work? The man tried to talk but stumbles on his words, \"Well, I-I... I-I mean I'm sorry for this madam, I shall be on my-\"Before he got to finish, the women grabbed his hand, she said, \"Don't worry, fella! Tell you what, because it's your first time here. I'll show you around. Trust me it will be fun\". The women took the man all into the festival, what the man was shown shocked him, vibrant colors flew through the air, people laughing, smiling, talking, and dancing all around him, and music that vibrated the ground and through the man's ears. Everyone and everything seeming to give the place here has a life of its own.\"W-Wow!\", The man spoke out. He was in awe of this place; he never knew such a place existed in this concrete jungle of his. The woman looked back and saw the man's face in awe and smiled. \"Well, don't you want to see more? Come on, let go!\", the women yelled. They went all over the festival, eating, dancing, singing, and laughing all throughout.Though the festival didn't last for long, but for the man it felt like years to him, the once gray and dull life of the man was now filled with colors and music breeding new life right in front of him.\"Hey,\" the women say, exhausted by their activities. \"You seem to have enjoyed it a lot. Do you want to come back again? It happens here once a week.\"\"Y-Yes, I would like to go here again.\"\"Great! See you here next week!\" the woman waved as she ran off.The man returned home, despite the bus ride was the same, the mood was brighter than before. He did his routine, but this time he did it with a smile. He laid back on his bed and looked around, it was the same, but it was different, it felt brighter. The man wondered why for a bit but didn't bother to answer. He smiled.The man now at a lighter pace just decided to change his routine just a bit."}

From the moment i read her profile and when we first met. I knew that she was going to be my first choice.She grew up in a country setting, attended the best universities and had a string of awards to her name. Heck, she had a scientific theory of her own creation. Her intelligence was undeniable, and I couldn’t help but envision our future children inheriting her brilliant mind.Her family was a respectable wealthy one. Private in their affairs. Her father owning several food processing companies of his own, and had inherited an oil company from his family as the only child. Her mother, despite the tainted roles she played on the screen she had redeemed herself in the eyes of the society and had set up a charity foundation.\"Oliver, nice to meet you.\" She had greeted at the introduction dinner. Her voice was tamed, she carried herself with grace. There was no frivolity in her choice of attire; it was all about practicality and elegance.As the night progressed It was clear that humor was not her forte, and she seemed to prefer straightforward, earnest conversation.Within seconds of meeting she was showing me an entire folder of how she laid out her life, at eighteen she had frozen her eggs, at twenty two attained her doctorate and at thirty she had set out to be married and at thirty one have her first child. She had even remained a virgin as she had planned. Things seemed to be going as she had intended; i just hoped what ailed me was not going to interfere with that. She didn’t believe in love, but in the practicality of a marriage.Despite her seemingly impenetrable exterior, I found myself drawn to Iris’s sense of purpose and the determination that radiated from her. I admired her for having her entire life mapped out, for knowing who she was and what she wanted. There was an aura of reliability and dependability that surrounded her, a quality i found strangely comforting.\"Please, you don't have to settle with her. I haven't seen her smile since we met. \" Cara would whisper to me that night as Iris sat alone on the table reading a book on the night that was suppose to be an engagement night.\"I like her.\" I would reply\"You could marry someone you love.\"\"Not everyone finds love like you and Quinn. We just take what life gives us.\"Cara stared at me, her eyes filled with love and sadness all together. \"Congratulation then, brother.\"As Cara walked away, i knew i had to reveal my condition to my bride to be.Present timeThe wedding day.The wedding day has arrived. Quinn helps with my cuffs while Theo shines his shoe at the furthest end of the room. He glances up at his father and smiles; he’s all grown up, and to an outsider, they may look like brothers.“For someone who swore they’d never get tied down, you look very happy to be,” Theo remarks.I chuckle and admire my reflection in the mirror.“Even the wildest stallions need to be tamed,” I quip, and Theo shakes his head.“I’m never getting married with so many endless options,” he adds.“You talk like your father did when he was your age, but look at him now,” Ryan walks in.“I’m not weak; they won’t take me down that easily,” Theo says as he finishes shining his shoes.“You’ll meet her someday, and before you know it, you’ll be a goner,” I say with a sense of melancholy.He smiles and shakes his head, “You all are a bunch of helpless romantics.”Quinn’s phone rings, and he immediately answers it.I adjust my tie for the umpteenth time. Doubt starts to creep in, and I wonder if I’m making a mistake. It’s a leap of faith, a plunge into the unknown, and uncertainty gnaws at me. I take a deep breath and remind myself of the reason I’m doing this.“Everything is set, and they’re waiting for us,” Quinn informs, and the initial nervousness sets in.We walk out; the wedding is being held at the Nickel Manor. It’s a small, invite-only ceremony, and only close family and friends are aware of it.Most of the guests are already seated. I spot Cara and Mr. Wayne at the front row. Ryan has already taken his spot as the DJ, and as soon as we get closer, he starts to play “Shut Up and Dance.”Quinn, as my best man, stands beside me, and the other groomsmen begin to dance, stirring the cheers of the audience. I look over at Quinn and assure him that I’ll kill him for putting me in a position where I’ll embarrass myself. I told him no dancing. I suck at it!I make a mess of myself, but thankfully, no legs are broken as I reach where the priest stands and nervously wait for my bride.Ryan announces that the next song was requested by the bride, “Bless The Broken Road” by Rascal Flatts. It’s an unusual choice, I think, as I listen to the lyrics.A whirlwind of emotions sweeps over me as I see her on her father’s arm, Meyer. Something seems different, even under the veil. She looks shorter, and her head hangs low in a sad slump. Even as her father hands her over to me with a concerned look, all my focus is on her.The priest’s words get lost before they reach me. I hadn’t written any vows, so we rely on the general traditional ones. “....in sickness and in health....” When the priest gets to that part, Iris clears her throat, and silence falls as the priest stops to ask her if she’s okay. She nods.He continues and finally says, “You may kiss the bride...”I hesitate for a moment before I step forward to lift the veil and freeze as I see the face under it.It’s Jessie!More chapters at Inkitt.

My heart grew restless and panicked and I was afraid of what to expect. Damon had said that the witch wanted to see my future and my past to determine if she would help me. What factors would cause her to decline? I watched seemingly endless trees turn into roads premiered by mountains and finally, we entered a busy city. I recognized it as soon as we entered because I had been wanting to visit ever since I was a little girl. New York.Odd how the circumstances have changed. It was almost night time but the city was still alive. Cars and pedestrians lined the roads as if one. I watched shop owners sell fruit on the streets and wondered if they had any idea about the world that exists just a few hours away. I realized how far away from home I was and grew sick. About twenty minutes later we had reached a more quiet area and the signs above the streets read Brooklyn.We drove into an alley and the car suddenly stopped. I turned to look at Damon who was already getting out of the car. I took a deep breath in and mirrored his actions. I realized that both the driver and the guard remained in the car.\"This is it?\" I examined my surroundings. Metal rusty stairs lined the gravel walls of the alley leading up to people's apartments. \"She lives up here in one of those,\" Damon pointed up towards a second apartment. I walked almost on his heel and followed  him up the noisy stairs. He turned to look at me before lifting his fist to knock on the door but it flew wide open before he got the chance. Behind the door stood a beautiful long haired brunette with dark eye makeup and maroon lips. She wore a long-sleeve crimson satin dress and her long black fingernails were pointy like fangs. She squealed when she saw Damon and threw herself at him, her long olive-toned arms wrapping around his neck.\"Damon!\" She screamed out, planting kisses all along his face,\" I'm so happy to see you!\" Damon returned the hug with less enthusiasm and I found myself suddenly wondering who she was to him. \"Luna,\" he greeted,\" it's a shame we have to meet under these circumstances.\"They pulled back from each other and Luna turned her previously enlightened gaze to meet with mines. She looked doubtful and sarcastic.\"So this is the foreigner?\" She asked Damon, still looking at me. I gulped nervously. Damon took an almost nervous look at me and smiled at Lunda,\" yes it is.\"\"Well, come in.\"Inside, her apartment was small and cozy. A black velvet couch took up most of the living room. Plants hung by pot holders dangling from the ceiling and about a dozen pillar candles  lined the corners of the apartment. I could see part of her kitchen in the back where a small black cat hid behind an appliance, watching me. Following my gaze, Luna said,\" That's Jinx, he's friendly....most of the time.\"I forced a smile and figured it be better if I behaved myself if there was any chance that she was willing to help me. \"He's adorable,\" I replied softly.Damon took a seat on the couch and it was almost odd to see him in a setting that was so humane. He stuck out like a sore thumb and anybody within a hundred meters could tell you that he did not belong. I sat beside him and watched as Lunda opened up a bottle of red wine and poured it into some glasses.She reached out to hand Damon a glass who took it without a second thought and she did the same to me.\"I'm not 21-\" I began.\"Drink it,\" she insisted.I nodded and took the glass from between her fingers, bringing it up to my lips and taking a sip of the rich and bitter wine.\"So Damon,\" Luna sat on the L-shaped part of the couch, facing me and Damon,\" I have to admit it makes me sad that you chose now to come to visit me, when you reached out I thought you had something else in mind.\"She sipped on her wine and in her hands, it looked like a million dollars.\"I meant to reach out sooner, but things haven't been so smooth at the castle and what you see here,\" he pointed his chin in my direction,\" is an example.\"\"I assume it was Seth who got you into this mess.\"Damon smirked slightly,\" Of course. He's turning eighteen in a few weeks, he had been trying out his new powers and she-\"\"Was collateral damage,\" Lunda finished his sentence.He nodded in disappointment,\" You see why I need you, father does not have much say with the witches ever since-\"\"Ever since he tried to kill one of us for mating with a bloodsucker?\" Luna hissed out. Damon's gaze hardened,\" yes, so as you can imagine, it's a little difficult getting a witch to perform the Ritual of Obliteration. We have no more credibility with the witches.\"\"If your father keeps going at the rate that he's going, soon enough he won't have credibility with all The Underworld,\" Luna's words were almost like a threat. \"He's the King, you think that would mean something in this city-\" Damon began but Luna cut him off.\"He's your King, not ours.\"Damon nodded but remained silent. Luna's gaze trailed over my body and she looked me up and down, her eyes resting at the bites on my neck.\"Does she taste good?\"\"I wouldn't know,\" Damon answered, sparing me a quick glance,\" that wasn't me.\"She chuckled,\" Looks like someone else at the castle had enjoyed having her around, perhaps the King,\" she winked towards Damon. \"It wasn't the King-\"\"Perhaps your rule-breaking brothers, or that mischievous Isabelle-\"My focus asserted at the mention of Isabelle's name and I was surprised to know that she knew Isabelle. I wondered what she meant by mischievous and if she knew how mischievous Isabelle really was. Damon cut Luna off before she could continue,\" Luna, can you help me or not?\"\"Why does this matter so much to you Damon?\"The look in Luna's eyes was almost suspicious. Damon stared into hers without looking away and remained silent. I glanced between the both of them and wondered if I should answer for him. Because the King thinks that it's Damon's fault I'm here because Damon took the blame for Seth. Because if he doesn't figure out a way to get rid of me soon, the King might decide to dethrone him. Because Seth and Isabelle are going to do everything in their power to make Damon look unfit to be King and Damon doesn't know it.When Damon answered, it was almost as if he were King already.\"A foreign human in a castle of young and inexperienced bloodthirsty vampires leaves too much room for rebellion,\" his teeth weren't gritted but he spoke as if they were,\" if the Council were to find out of this, there would be serious consequences.\"Luna's lips lifted into a smile,\" they might stake your brothers...or you if you continue to take the blame for them both.\"I looked towards Damon with sad eyes and realized that this must have been a regular thing for him to do, taking the blame for something his brothers did. I  wondered why he did it and wondered how his siblings turned out to be so different from him.A sudden image of him twisting the wooden sword inside of the jester sprung into my mind and I reminded myself that maybe he wasn't too different.\"Can you help me or not Luna,\" Damon finally asked. She nodded and stood up, setting her wine glass on the island of her kitchen,\" wait here.\"She disappeared into the back of the apartment and Damon and I sat in uncomfortable silence. \"W-what's going to happen next?\" I asked, almost afraid to.\"I'm not sure,\" his voice was soothing and I was almost relieved at the sound of it.\"If it works, will I just forget? How will I get home, would I pass out? M-my car-\"He cut me off when his cold hands cupped mines in a sudden movement.\"Don't worry about any of that. If this works, I'll get you home safely.\"I simply nodded and became more aware of his hands on mine. I didn't want to look up at his face because I knew I wouldn't be able to look away. I tried to shrug off the part of me that was disappointed for having to finally bid this life farewell.I knew I would miss Damon the most but I didn't know why. I also began to wonder if he had a personality disorder or if the stress of life was simply too much for him to keep a straight mood. I wanted to bring up Seth and Isabelle again, I wanted to warn him but I knew it wasn't the time. I had already tried once and it didn't work. Who's to say this time it would. Maybe this time, because I'm not inside a wet and murky cell, I had nothing to gain out of telling him a lie. Maybe this time, he'd believe me. Luna came out with a medium-sized black crystal ball and I thought about how much of the fairy tales they would tell us as kids were true. She placed the ball carefully on the kitchen table and to my surprise, it stayed put. She lifted up a long manicured nail and gestured for me to come.Damon recalled his hands and I stood up hesitantly and walked towards the kitchen table.\"Sit,\" Luna instructed as if talking to a puppy. I simply obeyed Damon began to stand up but he quickly sat back down when Luna snapped,\" You, stay.\"She sat on the seat across from me,\" place both your hands around the ball, and when it starts to heat up, don't move.\"I nodded and obeyed. My heart began to thud whilst in my chest and I grew nervous. The smooth cold exterior of the crystal ball began to warm up slowly as it lightened in color. I watched in fascination as the colors changed, transitioning between dark purple and orange. Luna placed her hands across the side of the crystal ball, her eyes glued to the movement of color. I looked up to see that she was completely dozed off, the fiery shade of the ball reflecting almost completely in her eyes.She held no expression. I almost wanted to turn around and glance at  Damon for reassurance but I didn't. I grew more nervous the faster the colors began to change. Luna's fingers started to quiver and I wondered if that was normal.The flashing colors began to finally slow down and I watched in complete fascination as a drawing formed. As if being drawn internally, a symbol formed almost resembling an arrow. When the drawing was complete, it glistening in gold and I could tell that it was indeed an arrow. Flames blared out from the tip of the sword. A burning arrow.\"Eros,\" Luna breathed out the word so slightly I could hardly hear her,\" The Mark of Eros.\"Luna slowly removed her hands and the crystal ball reverted back into its original pitch-black color. I mirrored her action.To my surprise, Luna had a slick smile on her face.\"I'm not touching you,\" she stated, almost wickedly.\"What, why?\" I immediately felt the hope that I had begun to shatter,\" but you said-\"\"What did you see,\" Damon was now up and standing beside me, his gaze locked with Luna,\" what do you mean you won't touch her.\"\"I mean I can't,\" Luna's expression had gone back to serious now.\"Why not,\" Damon insisted.\"The girl has the Mark of Eros,\" Luna stood up and grabbed the ball,\" she didn't enter The Underworld by mistake.\"She disappeared into the back and left a confused Damon and I.I wondered what the Mark of Eros was and if it had anything to do with the burning sword that had shown up on the crystal ball. I've never seen that symbol before in my life but it definitely resembled something I had seen in Greek mythology class. \"What's the Mark of Eros,\" I asked Damon,\" why can't she help me, what does it mean?\"He ignored me completely. Damon looked lost in thought and confusion. Luna came back out and he barked out,\" Are you sure that's what you seen?\"Luna now looked amused by all this,\" I'm offended.\"\"By who?\" Damon asked,\" can you at least tell me that?\"Luna stepped closer to Damon and played with the collar of his shirt,\" He's closer than you think.\"\"Do it anyway,\" Damon breathed out,\" Perform the ritual anyway.\"\"You want me to upset every god I believe in because you want to get rid of your little human problem?\" \"Please,\" Damon's eyes looked almost as if they were pleading.\"Sorry sexy,\" Luna turned to walk away from Damon,\" you were good, but no ones that good.\"\"What do I do now,\" he ordered,\" how do I take her back to the castle, proving to my father that I failed him once again.\"Luna shrugged,\" Not my problem, and your father should be the least of yours. You've got a marked foreigner on your hands now, you need to worry about that.\"\"Tell me by whom, whoever she belongs to, she'll be their problem too.\"\"I can't give you the hint and the answer as well Damon,\" she sat gracefully on the dining room chair and sipped her wine,\" you'll figure it out sooner or later.\"\"Luna-\"\"Now get her out of here before someone gets a whiff of her.\"\"Luna-\"\"Now Damon,\" she raised her eyebrows as if challenging him to decline. Damon looked down at me as if I was baggage and spat out,\" Let's go.\"I scrambled to my feet and ran behind him as he almost tore the door of its hinges and marched outside and down the stairs. In the distance, I heard Luna's voice echoing with the words,\" See you soon.\"Read the full book + gain access to my other work on Patreon. https://www.patreon.com/bynadine"}

His host nodded \"Of course, this does not mean my daughter should be in your care.\"\"If you were confident in your influence on her, you wouldn't have bothered to come to me,\" he said taking a calm stride across the room, to nestle in an armchair. Sir Edgar was never intimidated by anyone not even if the other person was one of the most respected retired Generals of the kingdom. He himself was of a tall slender stature though the years showed in his thick grey hair and shaggy brows but his handsome youth had left its traces. \"How dare you, Edgar? This is of utmost importance. My daughter is just temporarily strayed and you should not encourage her.\"Sir Edgar closed his eyes, women never mattered to him... of course he had one who did matter but she was no longer there. She had drifted from him the moment he had set foot out of the village even though he followed her for years keeping a watchful eye on her safety. He couldn't save her from the largest distress of her life...herself. He playfully fumbled the diamond in his hand \"Then you seem most sincere, sir. I shall grant your wish but make sure she shall never disparage my door again.\"Minister Halworth was surprised by the change of attitude but he was promptly glad. He would confine the girl even if it took his life because if news went out to the king he knew his majesty would make the most of it and end up marrying his widowed daughter to one of his prominent advisors in an act of chivalry knowing fully well his majesty intends to keep a closer eye on his subordinates who were retired and who had great resource to rebel. His daughter had to his horror liked Sir Edgar the moment she had set her eyes on him. She was a middle aged woman yet she lacked restraint and had even arrived unannounced to Sir Edgar's house causing much confusion within the neighborhood. He had not the power to stop the people but he knew Sir Edgar could but he does things only if he was strongly compelled to and to compel him one needs to give him something with much worth.Sir Edgar waved a hand at him silently making Minister Halworth almost run outside fearing he would change his mind. The advisor in his late fifty years felt much lost, his loneliness solely derived from the lack of being able to wander outside. his recent health has prevented him on going to dangerous excursions to prevent thinking about her but now all he could do was rumble in his thoughts. A twinkle appeared in his eyes when he heard the familiar and rare step.                    ******\"You look better than ever, Uncle,\" I said charmingly with a smile. He paused a while before answering  as I saw a slight sparkle in his eyes appearing to be from submerged tears. I knew who invaded his thoughts, his one infatuation of the past still haunting his regrets. He managed to grin while answering \"Escaped...I am surprised you have still survived.\"I chuckled \"You say the most unexpected things,\" she said \"Uncle, how is our kingdom faring?\"\"You have something you want to know,\" he rang the bell ordering his maid to bring cakes, buns and tea surprising her as she gave a cautious glance at the pretty young girl sitting in his study which was never allowed for strangers.She was even more taken a back when I stood and held her hand. \"Ah, it's been tough on you. Don't worry, your sister will win so have a good sleep.\"She stood like an idiot for a moment till her master ordered her to go back. I went back to my seat \"Uncle don't you want to know my adventures?\"\"I know you had an interesting time and something fidgeting in your mind.\"I laughed \"Oh you know, there is always something waiting to pop out from my mouth. How about asking me how I got out?\"\"Someone surely did,\" he said \"You lazy bones wouldn't dare try.\"\"Oh Uncle! can't you humor me a bit,\" I pleaded, seeing him visibly thaw but he picked up a book and pretended to be engrossed in it. \"I met the future heir of the Blood Loom Kingdom.\"This made him start, he was always worried about my interaction with power holders. He has always warned, anyone can do anything to get what they want especially if what they want seems the most impossible for them.\"What are you saying? You don't mean Dalton Volto Loom,\" his eyes were piercing me trying to read my mind but I evaded it \"Yes, I mean him. He thinks he won't get the position but now it seems like my prophecy will come true after all. He came here actually to get my father's thumbprint.\"Uncle Edgar closed his eyes scrunching them in worry. I hoped he would start scolding me after tea was over. I was famished from the journey and trying to evade Volto's watchful eyes.He inhaled deeply \"What's the use of telling you anything?\" he began but he spoke much less harsh than I expected \"He was supposed to marry you but good thing your father realized the trouble and changed the engagement but still you two met anyway.\"\"Uncle, I know you worry but I am ready to accept my fate. I had a comfortable life and I have nothing to complain about so I don't seem upset about dying.\"He looked away and walked to the window showing the busy street below. \"I want to ask you about another thing. Was there anyone named Damien near me? I seem to have a vague impression.\"\"You finally remembered him. He was my good student and you chose him the moment you saw him even though he was just ordinary in most skills.\"\"Why don't I remember him being here while I left the palace?\"\"Because he left...before you. He went to the military front to assist his friend.\"\"Then why didn't father send him back to me when he returned? He let me have all my previous maids and soldiers.\"\"He couldn't send him,\" his voice grew grim \"He died.\"Just as the words entered my mind a strong pain grasped my heart. It felt like someone thrust a knife unlike the usual price of prophecy. Tears dropped from my eyes uncontrollably and I could vaguely hear my Uncle call my name but it grew further into the distance...further and further."}

Others are busy on themselves. After almost half an hour shiva also drift into sleep. Some goons stop their bikes and beat shiva hard as well as hit raavi on back head. \"Bhaiya aaf hame chordo aafko jo chaiya ham dedenge pakka\" \"Aee chipkali tu chup reh barna mai tujhe ingundo ke pass chorkar bhagjaunga samjhi\"\"Aaagr yeh maegaya to iska kya hoga....... Koi baat nahi mai hun na tere liya\" someone touch raavi's shoulder and shiva beat him\"Bhootnath aab mujhe vi khol\" Shiva was about to leave the room but stop and look at tied raavi and...........Raavi was alone in room of that godown all scared when someone hold her hands tightly, make her stand and slap her hard making her fall on floor hard and take his belt out staring her angrily.......... After sometime shiva come back but the door was locked inside, he bang the door hard \"Raavi darwaja khol\".......... Shiva's sleep broke because of pain on his hand due to tight clutch of raavi, her nails was picering his skin making its red almost about to bleed.He get little angry and look toward raavi to find her sweating badly and taking deep breath murmuring very slowly \"shiva please bacchao yeh mujhe maar dega please shiva bacchao\" He understands what she might be thinking and pat her cheeks slowly to wake her up. \"Chipkali uth ankhe khol chipkali\" Shiva look around and find water bottle and smatch some droplets on her face. Raavi get up with a jerk taking deep breath. \"Raavi tu thik hai\" She look at shiva and stare for half an minute then look around the surrounding realising she is safe, she close her eyes taking long deep breath of relief. \"Chipkali tu thik hai na\" shiva again asked this time creasing her back with his left hand. Raavi again look at him and look down and noded in \"yes\" \"Pani pile chal\" shiva forward water bottle toward raavi and raavi drink it holding shiva's hand as shiva make her drink water by himself. \"Bas\" He keep bottle aside \"Tu pakka thik hai\" She again noded and rest her head on his shoulder and he hold her tight giving her the feeling of safety. She close her eyes and hold shiva's hand making him hiss in pain. She jerk open her eyes and look at him \"Kya hua?\" \"Kuch nai\" he surged it off but raavi look at her hand then remove from his hand to saw his scratches formed by nails. She feels guilty and mumbles \"Sorry\" and left his hand but he hold her hand. She again close her eyes and calm herself down. Shiva look at her, then he look around gaura was too lost on their talks, Krish was sleeping soundly, Dishita was watching phone using headphones being cossy with eachother. He sighed realising no body literally no body had asked about them after coming back from godowns, neither care to confort janardhan for kidnapping them. After sometime, \"Mujhe bhuk lagi hai dhara bhabhi\" Krish said as soon as he wake up being hungry\"Aare Krish khane ka saman to sab piche bus ke dikki me rakha hai\" dhara said \"Bhook to mujhe vi lagi hai\" Dev said \"Mujhe vi... Ek kaam karte hai aage kahi rukhkar nasta karte hai fir aage jayenge\" \"Sab ko bhuk lagi hai\" rishita speak excitedly\"Ha... Par tu itni exited keu horahi hai\" Ignoring dhara rishita stand up and\"Maine na sandwich 🥪 banake lae hun... Rukho\" She take sandwiches out and forward toward Dev. \"Yeh lo Dev\" Dev take it, rishita went forward \"Yeh le Krish\" \"Gautam bhaiya yeh lo\" He was about to take but dhara interputed\"Rishita yeh to kharab hogaya hoga aabtak khane layak nahi hoga..... Mat khao koi rukhjao thodi der mai nasta laihu\"Rishita ignore dhara but feel bad when Dev keep the sandwich back \"At least try to karne deti par nai... Mahan banna hai\" rishita murmur slowly and went toward her seat grumpily. Shiva ignore it all but raavi feel bad for rishita seeing her sad, she knew how it feels when someone try to do something for other's and they didn't even bother to try it once. \"Rishita mujhe bhuk lagi hai.... Mujhe dona please\" \"Par raavi...\" Dhara begin but rishita cut her \"Saachi tum khayogi\" she asked excitedly and went toward her Raavi noded with weak smile. \"Par raavi thodi der rukhja na\" \"Dhara Di try karke dekhlete hai na sayad kharab na hua ho aur mujhe sachme bohot bhuk lagrahi hai\" \"Raavi tu itni jiddi keu hai abhi jaban larane laggai tu.....\"Bhabhi uska maan hai to khane dona kharab hoga to chordegi, keu chilla raheho khamakha\" shiva said without looking toward dhara making everyone again shockedRaavi take the parsal of sandwich from rishita. Looking at it she understands that it's already damaged but she was actually very hungry and also didn't wanted to make rishita feel dejected.Raavi in mind - Yeh to kharab hogaya hai kya karu.. rishita ko bura lagega aur mujhe bhuk vi bohot lagrahi hai Rishita - kya hua kha na Raavi - ha... ha kha rahihu Shiva was noticing her changing expression. Shiva - Rishita jakar behet jao girjaogi.. yeh khalegi jab khana hoga \"Shiva bhabhi hai wo teri tamijse baat kar\" dhara speak angrily rishita rolled her eyes as she hate dhara. Suddenly because of sudden jerk on bus rishita was about to fall but stable herself holding the seat \"Bola tha na\" shiva said And rishita went and sit beside Dev and take a sandwich to eat but again bus jerk and it fall down from her hands, she sighed. Otherside raavi was staring at the sandwich when due to sudden jerk of bus she jerk forward and was about to hit her head on her front seat but shiva hold her and protect.\"Kya karrahi hai ghadedi\" he asked angrily yet concernt. \"Sorry\" \"Samhal kar behet na... behetna vi nahi aata kya\" he said annoyingly \"Bola to sorry\" She said making pout and again stare the sandwich\"Nahi khana to mat khana mu keu banarahi hai\" \"Bohot bhuk lagi hai mai bhukse margai to\" she said cutely, staring at sandwich \"par yeh kharab lagrahi hai\" \"To mat khana thodi der ki to baat hai\" shiva said but then realized that she was hungry from yesterday itself as she didn't eat anything at night because she was lost in fear and morning she wake up late. \"Try karke dekhti hun ek baar\" she murmur to herself and take a bite but her face lost its colour, her eyes get teary and she start coughing. Shiva immediately make her drink water and rub her back. \"Tu thik hai\" \"Ha\" she said making bad face because of bad test of damaged sandwich. \"Bola tha maine sunni kaha hai isko\" dhara taunt \"Rishita sorry par yeh sachme bohot jaida kharab hogai hai\" Raavi said as she put the sandwich down. \"Jab khana hi nahi tha to natak keu kiya mahan banneka stupid ladki bas drama karna aata hai sabko is family me\" rishita murmur making faces, shivi listen this and raavi feel bad but didn't react, shiva get angry and about to speak but\"Shiva mujhe bohot bhuk lagi hai kuch dona please\" she said resting her head on his shoulder, closing her eyes.\"Raavi thodi der rukhja aage kahi rukhte hai thik hai\" Shiva was looking outside when he saw shop. \"Raavi uth ek minute\" Raavi left him and shiva went to driver and driver stop the bus. Shiva went outside and come back after taking some plastic bags full of chips and cold drinks. \"Bhaiya aage kahi dhaba, hotel yah garden jaisi koi jaga jaha ham thodi der rukh sake yasa kuch dikhe to bus rokhna thik hai\" Shiva instruct the driver and went backside. \"Goumbi yeh lo\" he handle a plastic bag to goumbi and move forward\"Notanki yeh le\" He said while throwing a bag on Krish's lap. Krish dig into bag and happily start munching the chip's like an hungry kid who is hungry from years. He went near Dishita. \"Rish...\" pause \"um.. Bhabhi aafne to aafne sandwich khaliye honge na\" \"Koi na yeh lelo\" he said while placing a packet in dev's lap \"Thanks shiva\" Dev thanked but ignoring him royally shiva went to his raavi. Raavi immediately forward her both hands cutely like a child and shiva chuckling at her give her a bag and keep one bag on bus (are wo seat ke uper hota hai na jaha saman rakhte hai I don't know kya bolte hai samaj jao wahi rakha usne ek plastic bag). Raavi keep the plastic aside taking a chip packet, she opened it hurriedly, taking a handful of chips, she start munching hurriedly like someone will gonna snatch it from her. Shiva sit beside her staring at his bhukkad wife seen the speed of her eating. Feeling a strong gaze at her she look at the side finding shiva staring at her. She stare him back still eating chips then she look at the packet and forward it toward shiva. Shiva shake his head and put more chips on her mouth \"Tu kha bhukkad kahi ki... Kitne janam se bhuki hai tu\" he tease her\"Kalse\" she replied without paying much attention to his words \"Bhukkad\" he said \"Shut up and eat\" she said while opening another packet for herself after placing one chips packet on his lap for him. Shaking his head on her, he bend over her and take the bag and take out a cold drink bottle, open it and forward toward raavi. Without leaving her love I mean her chips she drink the cold drink from shiva's hand. Shiva get suprised by her childish behaviour but didn't said anything\"Thank you\" she said (Hehe... Gadede bhulgai hai ke yeh somnath ke jani dushman hai ek dusre se lade bina inka khana hajam nahi hota🤦bhulakkad kahike Hun😏😏...... koi na mai hun na mai yaad diladungi jaida jaldi nahi bas next part me😉😉... Tabtak ke liye parte rahiyeh meri baki stories aur dete rahiyeh mujhe aur meri kahaniyo ko dher sara pyaarrrr💕💕💕..... tata bye bye for now 👋👋♥️)Note - This story is nothing but the re-creation of Pandya Store. Almost everything is same, every single track, almost every thing but the only difference is shiva's perspective, his POV and Shivi's equestion. Here we found shiva as raavi's shiva, not as pandya pariwar ka beta but raavi ka supporter. Just the way shiva was always on Dhara's side even when she is wrong in our very own Pandya Store, here he is in raavi's side. "}
