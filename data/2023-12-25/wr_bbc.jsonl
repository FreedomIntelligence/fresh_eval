My grandchildren, my daughter, her husband - all gone.\n\"We are all targeted. Civilians are targeted. There is no safe place. They told us to leave Gaza City - now we came to central Gaza to die.\"\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society says \"intense\" Israeli air strikes have led to the closure of main roads between Maghazi and two other refugee camps, Al-Bureij and Al-Nuseirat, \"hindering the work of ambulances and rescue teams\".\nIn a statement to the BBC, the Israeli military said it had received \"reports of an incident in the Maghazi camp\".\n\"Despite the challenges posed by Hamas terrorists operating within civilian areas in Gaza, the IDF [Israeli Defense Forces] is committed to international law including taking feasible steps to minimize harm to civilians,\" it added.\nAccording to the health ministry, more than 20,000 people have been killed - mostly children and women - and 54,000 injured in Gaza since 7 October, when Hamas and other Palestinian groups attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages. \nEarlier on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war had come at a \"very heavy price\" for his country.\nThe Israeli military said more than a dozen soldiers had been killed in Gaza since Friday, bringing the total for the ground offensive launched after 7 October to 156.\nSaturday was one of its deadliest days but Mr Netanyahu said there was \"no choice\" but to keep fighting.\nThe new ceasefire proposal by Egypt would be implemented in three parts: \nIndirect negotiations would be held in Egypt with Qatari and US participation. \nAn Israeli source told Maariv newspaper that the Egyptian initiative could lead to negotiations. Hamas says it is studying the proposal.\nMeanwhile, the Danish shipping giant, Maersk, says it is preparing to resume shipping operations through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. \nThe announcement came after an international military operation, led by the US, was deployed to prevent the targeting of commercial ships by drones from areas of Yemen controlled by Houthi rebels. The Houthis have declared their support for Hamas and have said they would target any ship travelling to Israel.\nMaersk and other shipping companies stopped sending ships through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal earlier this month as a result of drone attacks. US Central Command said two days ago that a US navy destroyer had shot down four drones in the Red Sea launched from Yemeni territory.  \nIn another development, Pope Francis appealed for peace in the Middle East as he presided over a Christmas Eve Mass at Saint Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. \nReferring to the war between Israel and Hamas, the Pope said Jesus's message of peace was being drowned out by the \"futile logic of war\" in the very land where he had been born. \nAdditional reporting by other BBC News staff"}

Carrier pigeons - sure: they were once used to send messages back to shore and have graced many a deck during the ocean classic. But cats? No.\nOli's owner Bob Williams says the pair didn't set out to be pioneers. The moggy is simply part of the furniture on Sylph VI and leaving him behind on the boat's jaunt south was out of the question.\n\"I've done lots of crazy things, but this isn't one of them,\" Mr Williams told the BBC ahead of the race.\nOrganisers - while initially bemused - are also on board.\nThere are no race rules prohibiting animals, and cats have a long history in maritime travel, the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia pointed out.\n\"One of the great things about the Rolex Sydney Hobart is all the wonderful characters in the race and the diversity of boats,\" Commodore Arthur Lane said.\nWhile most eyes will be on the speedy super maxis - giant yachts with up to 24 crew - during the Boxing Day race, Sylph, a 12m (40ft) yacht made in 1960, will set off in the two-handed division where smaller boats compete with a slimmed down team.\n\"We're jokingly saying [it's] the two-handed and four-pawed division,\" Mr Williams said.\nA friend of his is co-skippering, he explains, and as for Oli: \"He's SC - ship's cat.\"\nWhile Sylph is an old hat - having taken part in six Sydney to Hobarts many decades ago - this is Mr William's first time racing it.\nBut both he and Oli have plenty of experience at sea.\nA retired navy officer, Mr Williams has spent his life traversing the ocean - including a recent single-handed circumnavigation of the globe - much of it with a feline companion by his side.\nOli, who is about 10 years old, joined him five years ago and quickly earned his sea legs.\n\"He used to get seasick, and he was a bit stressed to start off with... but now he's fine. He quite enjoys life,\" Mr Williams said.\nThe laidback kitty can usually be found meowing orders or napping on the job in the boat's cockpit.\n\"He's very sensible... Whenever it gets rough, he'll disappear down below to find a nice, safe spot to curl up.\"\nAnd get rough it just might. The 630 nautical mile (1,166km) dash has long been characterised by unpredictable and often brutal conditions - the worst, 25 years ago.\nCompetitors in the 1998 race were battered by a monster storm, which sank five boats and claimed the lives of six sailors.\nThis year forecasters have warned that the fleet could be in for thunderstorms, strong winds, and even hail along parts of the course.\nMr Williams jokes that he hasn't lost a cat at sea yet.\nBut turning serious, he stresses that he is prepared for any emergency.\n\"The cat overboard routine is just to have something like a towel or a thick rope handy so that they can climb back on board.\"\nThere's no life jacket for Oli though, because he simply wouldn't wear it: \"They're Houdinis… they'll escape from anything they don't like,\" Mr Williams says.\nBut although cats hate the water, he knows for a fact Oli can swim, because he once legged it into the ocean to avoid an overzealous dog.\nSylph and her occupants will be playing it safe though and proceeding towards Hobart at a comparatively leisurely pace.\nThe record for the fastest finish - set in 2017- is one day and nine hours. But that was a massive, modern super yacht built for speed.\n\"Sylph is an older slower boat... Our ambition is to get to Hobart in time for the New Year's celebration.\"\nThere they'll mark the occasion with a nip of rum, and perhaps some milk on the rocks for Oli."}

It can also deploy Merlin helicopters and unmanned aircraft.\nHMS Trent left its home port of Gibraltar in early December and is currently alongside in Bridgetown, Barbados for Christmas.\nThe warship is expected to anchor off the capital of Guyana, Georgetown, and conduct visits, joint activities and training with the country's navy and other allies. It cannot go alongside because the port is too shallow.\nThe vessel is mainly used for tackling piracy and smuggling, protecting fisheries, counterterrorism, providing humanitarian aid, and search and rescue operations, but the Royal Navy says it is also designed for border patrols and defence diplomacy.\nThe decision to send HMS Trent to Guyana is part of a growing UK effort to show international diplomatic support for Guyana.\nThis week the Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron said the UK would \"continue to work with partners in the region to ensure the territorial integrity of Guyana is upheld and prevent escalation\".\nDavid Rutley, the Foreign Office Minister for the Americas, visited Georgetown on 18 December, the first G7 representative to do so since Venezuela renewed its claim.\nHe promised Guyana the UK's \"unequivocal backing\" and welcomed Venezuela's promise to avoid using force.\nMr Rutley continued: \"The border issue has been settled for over 120 years. Sovereign borders must be respected wherever they are in the world.\n\"The UK will continue to work with partners in the region, as well as through international bodies, to ensure the territorial integrity of Guyana is upheld.\"\nVenezuela's Foreign Minister, Yvan Gil, criticised the visit, accusing the UK of destabilising the region.\nIn a post on X - formerly Twitter - he said: \"The former invading and enslaving empire, which illegally occupied the territory of Guayana Esequiba and acted in a skilful and sneaky manner against the interests of Venezuela, insists on intervening in a territorial controversy that they themselves generated.\"\nVenezuela disputes the border which was established under an international agreement in 1899.\nGuyana was formerly known as British Guiana before it secured its independence in 1966."}

But on the day the babies were due, war broke out and the little girls were born to the sound of Russian shells falling around them. \nWhen Hanna went for her first ultrasound scan, it showed a small dot - the baby she and Andriy had planned for so long. But on their next visit to the doctor they were told they were expecting twins. The third visit revealed she was actually pregnant with triplets. \n\"We were afraid to see the doctor for the fourth appointment,\" Hanna jokes. But the couple were happy. \"We really wanted children. God had heard us and gave us three at once,\" she tells the Ukrainecast podcast.\nHanna went into a maternity hospital in Chernihiv on 23 February 2022 for a Caesarean section, which was scheduled for the next morning. \nRumours about a Russian invasion had been spreading for a while but she did not believe them until early on 24 February when she got a message from her brother, who was studying at a military school. He told her that the war had started and he did not know where he was going to be sent. He urged her to leave Chernihiv. \nBut she could not leave straight away. Her operation was planned for 09:00 and the hospital staff were preparing to deliver their first triplets in three years. \nHanna could not believe the war had begun: \"I thought it would happen somewhere far away, in a field, a forest, but not in our lives.\"\nAndriy arrived at the hospital at 06:00 carrying suitcases filled with clothes and other supplies and tried to calm her down. \"He said that the main thing was to bring our children into this world,\" Hanna recalls.\nThe babies were born just minutes apart: Emilia at 09:36, Olivia at 09:37 and at 09:38 it was Melania's turn. \"I couldn't imagine they would be so beautiful,\" says Hannah.\nTen minutes later, at 09:48, the Ukrainian state border service officially announced that Russian military vehicles had entered the Chernihiv region.   \nChernihiv is in northern Ukraine on the border with Belarus - where Russian troops invaded from - and was immediately hit by shelling. Although Russia did not occupy the city, it was badly damaged.\nOn the evening after she gave birth, recovering from surgery and barely able to get out of bed, Hanna was told to go down to a bomb shelter with her babies. \"I was totally lost. I didn't understand how I would get there,\" she says.\nTo reach it, she had to go outside, where the temperature was close to zero. The nurses wrapped the babies in warm blankets and carried them for her.\nThere were about 100 people with newborns in the shelter and hospital staff delivered 20 babies down there, they later told Ukrainian media. \nAlthough Hanna's daughters were healthy, they were premature. Normally, they would have been put in a special incubator, but there wasn't one in the shelter, so the nurses took it in turns to cuddle them under their clothes to keep them warm.\n\"The girls were so defenceless. I was lying next to them and didn't know how to help them,\" Hanna says, her voice trembling.\nThey were tiny - Emilia and Melania weighed just 3.5lb and 3lb (1.6kg and 1.4kg), but Olivia was even smaller. She was 2.5lb (1.1kg) and she needed to be moved to the intensive care unit if she was going to survive. \nHanna and Andriy decided they couldn't send her there alone, so after a week in the bomb shelter the whole family moved up to the hospital's first floor. \nOlivia was in intensive care for about two weeks. \"We stayed in the hospital's corridor with the other two girls and only went down to the basement when there were massive explosions,\" says Hanna.  \nAt one point, Hanna was sitting in a corridor with Emilia and Melania, when she suddenly saw a massive flash followed by pitch darkness and smoke. \n\"I jumped up and grabbed my children, not knowing whether I was dead or alive,\" she says.\nThen she saw Andriy running towards her and they rushed to the intensive care room to see if Olivia had been hurt. \nThey ran past shattered windows, blown-off doors and destroyed walls. But luckily Olivia's room had not been touched and she was safe.\nFinally, on 20 March the family left the hospital and with the help of volunteers were evacuated to Kyiv.  \nThe journey, which would normally have taken two hours, took five as they had to take a roundabout route to avoid Russian troops.  \nThey later spent a few months in Slovakia before returning to their hometown. \nAll that time, Hanna was desperate for her father Anatolii to meet his granddaughters. He was fighting in the Ukrainian army and his messages were a source of huge strength.\n\"He kept saying: 'Hold on, I'm protecting you, I'm defending you. We will fight the Russians off,'\" she recalls.\nAfter Russian forces withdrew from the Chernihiv region in April 2022, Anatolii was sent to eastern Ukraine. \nThe family hoped he would come home in time for the girls' first birthday, but he never made it. On 11 January 2023 he was killed on the front line near Terny village in Donetsk. He was 51 years old.\n\"I keep thinking that the war will end and he will come home from the battlefield,\" says Hanna with tears in her eyes. \"I can't believe that our whole family won't be together.\"\nShe and Andriy compare the first year of their babies' lives to \"a scary movie\", but they say that thanks to the girls, there has also been a lot of love and happiness - \"three times more\".\nListen to the full story on BBC Ukrainecast"}

The images discovered inside this humble wooden box in 2018 - now seen for the first time - reveal much about a difficult history shared by the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. \n\"This box is a critical part of our history,\" Lori Oschefski, president of the charity Home Children Canada who has just purchased the box for the foundation's archives, said. \"I've never seen anything like it. By far, it's the most complete box that I have ever seen.\"\nThousands of orphaned and poor children were sent to fill the labour shortages overseas during the late Victorian era. Although the incentives were to give these young children a better life, the reality was very different. Children were unpaid and had no choice in their move. They were separated from family, and many were abused or neglected by those that took them in as cheap labour.\nIt is now a major aspect of many Canadians' shared history. An estimated 10% of Canada's population - around 4 million people - are descendants of the British Home Children. The vast majority are not aware of their stories, however, as most children did not tell their descendants about the past\nWhile Australia and the UK apologised for the forced migration of child labourers more than a decade ago, Ms Oschefski said there is some resentment over a fast-tracked motion in Canada's House of Commons that included an unofficial apology. \nThere was also no warning of its passage, meaning descendants and surviving British Home Children were not given an opportunity to speak, Ms Oschefski said. George Beardshaw, a 100-year-old man who is one of two surviving British Home Children, said he wants to ensure this part of Canadian history is not lost.\nCanada \"was built on the backs of these children and that needs to be recognised and needs never to be forgotten\", Ms Oschefski said. \nThese photos may help ensure that these boys' stories remain in the public eye. \nThe pictures in the box are of young boys on a farm in Scotland owned by George Carter Cossar. The farmer also owned a homestead in Gagetown - a small town in New Brunswick, Canada. \nMr Cossar's farm in Scotland operated as a kind of training ground for young Scottish boys before they were shipped out abroad.\nSome images show the boys working on the farm or playing football, and others depict young children looking as if they have just arrived from the slums of Glasgow. There are pictures of a grand house, and there is an image of some of the young boys in their Sunday best in front of a large ship.\nOld-fashioned projectors, known as magic lanterns, would be used to show pictures such as these in places like church halls across Great Britain. They would appear alongside cartoons and news items.  \nMalcolm Lindsay, the man who discovered the slides, said they were put together and exhibited to raise funds for the British migration scheme. \nMr Lindsay, who describes himself as a photo 'detectorist', came across the box in the Great Western Auction House in Glasgow in 2018. He began to investigate the images and dig into their stories. \nThis year's Antiques Roadshow Christmas special looks back on some of the most memorable stories to have appeared on the show to find out: \"What happened next?\" The Antiques Roadshow will air in the UK on 24th December on BBC One at 19:00 and will be available to watch internationally on the BBC Programme's website. \n\"If you start looking at an archive, things jump out at you,\" he said. \"It's exciting.\"\nMr Lindsay was particularly interested in the picture of the boys with their smart outfits in front of the ship. After noticing the boat's name, he was not only able to find out that the boat was bound for Canada, but he also found a list of the child passengers' names.  \nRealising the historical story these pictures uncovered, Mr Lindsay posted his find on Ms Oschefski's Facebook page. She bought them from him soon thereafter and received the box in the autumn. \nAs she opened the box, Ms Oschefski said \"a sense of purpose washed over me and gazing at the faces of those boys inspired me\". \nBeginning where Lindsay left off, Ms Oschefski is now working to match the passenger list names with the photos, using identifiers like the initials on the boys' suitcases. Four boys are carrying trunks with initials in one photo, which had the date 17 August 1912 scratched on its slide. The ship left a week later. \nMs Oschefski has been able to identify three of the boys in the picture so far: Joseph McCash (16), Hugh Baird (17), and Thomas Murray (16). Fifteen of the boys in the slides have been identified and nine have been tracked. Based on historical records, six served in the First World War.\nThe investigation continues and Ms Oschefski, whose mother was a Home Child taken from her destitute grandmother, knows the importance of finding images that help people understand the past. \nFinding pictures and talking about the stories, she said, \"gives you closure, gives you peace\".

Her operation was planned for 09:00 and the hospital staff were preparing to deliver their first triplets in three years.\nHanna could not believe the war had begun: \"I thought it would happen somewhere far away, in a field, a forest, but not in our lives.\"\nAndriy arrived at the hospital at 06:00 carrying suitcases filled with clothes and other supplies and tried to calm her down. \"He said that the main thing was to bring our children into this world,\" Hanna recalls.\nThe babies were born just minutes apart: Emilia at 09:36, Olivia at 09:37 and at 09:38 it was Melania's turn. \"I couldn't imagine they would be so beautiful,\" says Hannah.\nTen minutes later, at 09:48, the Ukrainian state border service officially announced that Russian military vehicles had entered the Chernihiv region.\nChernihiv is in northern Ukraine on the border with Belarus - where Russian troops invaded from - and was immediately hit by shelling. Although Russia did not occupy the city, it was badly damaged.\nOn the evening after she gave birth, recovering from surgery and barely able to get out of bed, Hanna was told to go down to a bomb shelter with her babies. \"I was totally lost. I didn't understand how I would get there,\" she says.\nTo reach it, she had to go outside, where the temperature was close to zero. The nurses wrapped the babies in warm blankets and carried them for her.\nThere were about 100 people with newborns in the shelter and hospital staff delivered 20 babies down there, they later told Ukrainian media.\nAlthough Hanna's daughters were healthy, they were premature. Normally, they would have been put in a special incubator, but there wasn't one in the shelter, so the nurses took it in turns to cuddle them under their clothes to keep them warm.\n\"The girls were so defenceless. I was lying next to them and didn't know how to help them,\" Hanna says, her voice trembling.\nThey were tiny - Emilia and Melania weighed just 3.5lb and 3lb (1.6kg and 1.4kg), but Olivia was even smaller. She was 2.5lb (1.1kg) and she needed to be moved to the intensive care unit if she was going to survive.\nHanna and Andriy decided they couldn't send her there alone, so after a week in the bomb shelter the whole family moved up to the hospital's first floor.\nOlivia was in intensive care for about two weeks. \"We stayed in the hospital's corridor with the other two girls and only went down to the basement when there were massive explosions,\" says Hanna.\nAt one point, Hanna was sitting in a corridor with Emilia and Melania, when she suddenly saw a massive flash followed by pitch darkness and smoke.\n\"I jumped up and grabbed my children, not knowing whether I was dead or alive,\" she says.\nThen she saw Andriy running towards her and they rushed to the intensive care room to see if Olivia had been hurt.\nThey ran past shattered windows, blown-off doors and destroyed walls. But luckily Olivia's room had not been touched and she was safe.\nFinally, on 20 March the family left the hospital and with the help of volunteers were evacuated to Kyiv.\nThe journey, which would normally have taken two hours, took five as they had to take a roundabout route to avoid Russian troops.\nThey later spent a few months in Slovakia before returning to their hometown.\nAll that time, Hanna was desperate for her father Anatolii to meet his granddaughters. He was fighting in the Ukrainian army and his messages were a source of huge strength.\n\"He kept saying: 'Hold on, I'm protecting you, I'm defending you. We will fight the Russians off,'\" she recalls.\nAfter Russian forces withdrew from the Chernihiv region in April 2022, Anatolii was sent to eastern Ukraine.\nThe family hoped he would come home in time for the girls' first birthday, but he never made it. On 11 January 2023 he was killed on the front line near Terny village in Donetsk. He was 51 years old.\n\"I keep thinking that the war will end and he will come home from the battlefield,\" says Hanna with tears in her eyes. \"I can't believe that our whole family won't be together.\"\nShe and Andriy compare the first year of their babies' lives to \"a scary movie\", but they say that thanks to the girls, there has also been a lot of love and happiness - \"three times more\".\nListen to the full story on BBC Ukrainecast"}

If the liquidator is as good as their word then the renovations can happen quite quickly once the structural work has been completed.\n\"We are talking late spring early summer for its reopening.\n\"It has been a terrible few years and I could have walked away with the insurance money but I would never have done that as I want to see it thriving again.\n\"I would always stand by my cafe.\"\nMr Taylor, who has owned the cafe for 28 years, has now opened a second Elephant House around the corner in Victoria Street selling Butterscotchbeer - a similar drink to the Butterbeer Harry Potter enjoys in JK Rowling's books.\nThe new cafe looks down into Victoria Street - considered by fans to be the inspiration for Rowling's Diagon Alley.\nThe table JK Rowling used to lean on to write part of her books was salvaged from the fire and restored. It is currently in the new Elephant House in Victoria Street, which opened earlier this week.\nThe table will be moved back to the original cafe in George IV Bridge when it reopens next year.\nMr Taylor has also launched The Elephant Cafe International franchise with Andrew McRae, owner of the Museum Context retail chain - the seller of officially licensed Harry Potter merchandise.\nThey are opening up a franchise in Manilla in February where JK Rowling's table will be for one month.\nThey are also looking at other franchises in Asia.\nMr McRae is joint owner of the new Elephant House in Victoria Street, which is just a few doors along from a branch of Museum Context.\nCurrently Mr Taylor has metal scaffolding holding up the ceiling of his cafe, which was put in as an emergency and temporary measure by City of Edinburgh Council.\nIt is believed the fire started in the Patisserie Valerie cafe - which also has a basement that runs underneath The Elephant House.\nIt is understood Patisserie Valerie will not reopen in the property.\nThe Elephant House was one of two used regularly by Rowling when she was writing the stories of the boy wizard in the mid-90s.

May all of their souls rot in hell when their time comes.\"\nCooper's wife wept as courtroom officers moved to handcuff her husband, according to reporters in court.\nMr McClain had been walking home from a convenience store when he was stopped by three police officers responding to a call about a \"sketchy\" individual in the area.\nAt the time of the incident, on 24 August 2019, he was wearing headphones and a balaclava to protect himself from chronic chills caused by anaemia, his family has said. Mr McClain initially ignored the officers' commands to stop.\nHe was placed in a chokehold during the confrontation that followed. Bodycam footage of the incident shows him repeatedly telling officers: \"I can't breathe.\"\nMr McClain is also heard pleading with the officers: \"I'm an introvert and I'm different.\"\nAfter he was restrained, Cooper and Cichuniec injected him with ketamine, a powerful sedative. He never regained consciousness and died after being removed from life support three days later.\nDefence lawyers argued the two paramedics had followed their training in administering the sedative after diagnosing Mr McClain with \"excited delirium\".\nProsecutors said the paramedics had failed to conduct basic medical checks on Mr McClain, before injecting him with the maximum dose of ketamine. \nThey had also left him lying on the ground, making it difficult to breathe, and had failed to monitor his condition.\nThree officers held Mr McClain up against a wall during the incident. In bodycam footage, Mr McClain can be heard saying: \"I intend to take my power back.\"\nOne of the policemen is then heard saying: \"He just grabbed your gun, dude.\"\nBut it is unclear from the dark and jerky footage whether Mr McClain tried to grab any officer's firearm, as lawyers for the policemen maintained, and prosecutors said that had never happened.\nTwo officers involved in the incident, Nathan Woodyard and Jason Rosenblatt, were acquitted of charges in November and October, respectively.\nA third officer, Randy Roedema, was found guilty in October of criminally negligent homicide and third-degree assault. Prosecutors in that case argued that his statement that Mr McClain was \"definitely on something\" had contributed to the paramedics' decision to inject him with ketamine.\nRoedema is due to be sentenced in January.\nThe city of Aurora in 2021 agreed to pay $15m (£12m) to settle a lawsuit brought by Mr McClain's parents."}

Carrier pigeons - sure: they were once used to send messages back to shore and have graced many a deck during the ocean classic. But cats? No.\nOli's owner Bob Williams says the pair didn't set out to be pioneers. The moggy is simply part of the furniture on Sylph VI and leaving him behind on the boat's jaunt south was out of the question.\n\"I've done lots of crazy things, but this isn't one of them,\" Mr Williams told the BBC ahead of the race.\nOrganisers - while initially bemused - are also on board.\nThere are no race rules prohibiting animals, and cats have a long history in maritime travel, the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia pointed out.\n\"One of the great things about the Rolex Sydney Hobart is all the wonderful characters in the race and the diversity of boats,\" Commodore Arthur Lane said.\nWhile most eyes will be on the speedy super maxis - giant yachts with up to 24 crew - during the Boxing Day race, Sylph, a 12m (40ft) yacht made in 1960, will set off in the two-handed division where smaller boats compete with a slimmed down team.\n\"We're jokingly saying [it's] the two-handed and four-pawed division,\" Mr Williams said.\nA friend of his is co-skippering, he explains, and as for Oli: \"He's SC - ship's cat.\"\nWhile Sylph is an old hat - having taken part in six Sydney to Hobarts many decades ago - this is Mr William's first time racing it.\nBut both he and Oli have plenty of experience at sea.\nA retired navy officer, Mr Williams has spent his life traversing the ocean - including a recent single-handed circumnavigation of the globe - much of it with a feline companion by his side.\nOli, who is about 10 years old, joined him five years ago and quickly earned his sea legs.\n\"He used to get seasick, and he was a bit stressed to start off with... but now he's fine. He quite enjoys life,\" Mr Williams said.\nThe laidback kitty can usually be found meowing orders or napping on the job in the boat's cockpit.\n\"He's very sensible... Whenever it gets rough, he'll disappear down below to find a nice, safe spot to curl up.\"\nAnd get rough it just might. The 630 nautical mile (1,166km) dash has long been characterised by unpredictable and often brutal conditions - the worst, 25 years ago.\nCompetitors in the 1998 race were battered by a monster storm, which sank five boats and claimed the lives of six sailors.\nThis year forecasters have warned that the fleet could be in for thunderstorms, strong winds, and even hail along parts of the course.\nMr Williams jokes that he hasn't lost a cat at sea yet.\nBut turning serious, he stresses that he is prepared for any emergency.\n\"The cat overboard routine is just to have something like a towel or a thick rope handy so that they can climb back on board.\"\nThere's no life jacket for Oli though, because he simply wouldn't wear it: \"They're Houdinis… they'll escape from anything they don't like,\" Mr Williams says.\nBut although cats hate the water, he knows for a fact Oli can swim, because he once legged it into the ocean to avoid an overzealous dog.\nSylph and her occupants will be playing it safe though and proceeding towards Hobart at a comparatively leisurely pace.\nThe record for the fastest finish - set in 2017- is one day and nine hours. But that was a massive, modern super yacht built for speed.\n\"Sylph is an older slower boat... Our ambition is to get to Hobart in time for the New Year's celebration.\"\nThere they'll mark the occasion with a nip of rum, and perhaps some milk on the rocks for Oli."}

My grandchildren, my daughter, her husband - all gone.\n\"We are all targeted. Civilians are targeted. There is no safe place. They told us to leave Gaza City - now we came to central Gaza to die.\"\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society says \"intense\" Israeli air strikes have led to the closure of main roads between Maghazi and two other refugee camps, Al-Bureij and Al-Nuseirat, \"hindering the work of ambulances and rescue teams\".\nIn a statement to the BBC, the Israeli military said it had received \"reports of an incident in the Maghazi camp\".\n\"Despite the challenges posed by Hamas terrorists operating within civilian areas in Gaza, the IDF [Israeli Defense Forces] is committed to international law including taking feasible steps to minimize harm to civilians,\" it added.\nAccording to the health ministry, more than 20,000 people have been killed - mostly children and women - and 54,000 injured in Gaza since 7 October, when Hamas and other Palestinian groups attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages. \nEarlier on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war had come at a \"very heavy price\" for his country.\nThe Israeli military said more than a dozen soldiers had been killed in Gaza since Friday, bringing the total for the ground offensive launched after 7 October to 156.\nSaturday was one of its deadliest days but Mr Netanyahu said there was \"no choice\" but to keep fighting.\nThe new ceasefire proposal by Egypt would be implemented in three parts: \nIndirect negotiations would be held in Egypt with Qatari and US participation. \nAn Israeli source told Maariv newspaper that the Egyptian initiative could lead to negotiations. Hamas says it is studying the proposal.\nMeanwhile, the Danish shipping giant, Maersk, says it is preparing to resume shipping operations through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. \nThe announcement came after an international military operation, led by the US, was deployed to prevent the targeting of commercial ships by drones from areas of Yemen controlled by Houthi rebels. The Houthis have declared their support for Hamas and have said they would target any ship travelling to Israel.\nMaersk and other shipping companies stopped sending ships through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal earlier this month as a result of drone attacks. US Central Command said two days ago that a US navy destroyer had shot down four drones in the Red Sea launched from Yemeni territory.  \nIn another development, Pope Francis appealed for peace in the Middle East as he presided over a Christmas Eve Mass at Saint Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. \nReferring to the war between Israel and Hamas, the Pope said Jesus's message of peace was being drowned out by the \"futile logic of war\" in the very land where he had been born. \nAdditional reporting by other BBC News staff"}

On the same date, as one big family, as one nation, as one united country.\" \nIn the capital Kyiv, married couple Lesia Shestakova, a Catholic, and Oleksandr Shestakov, who is Orthodox, are celebrating Christmas together.\nThe pair - who until now marked Christmas twice, with their respective parents - attended the Sunday morning service at the city's Catholic cathedral (pictured above).\n\"There is finally a day in Ukraine which my husband and I can spend together in the cathedral and thank God that we are together, alive and in good health,\" Lesia told Reuters news agency.\nThe Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU), a newly created independent church that held its first service in 2019, has also changed its Christmas date to 25 December. \nIt formally broke away from the Russian Orthodox church over Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine.\nPeople prayed and lit candles across the country on Sunday. \nIn the western city of Lviv, which has been little damaged by the war, children in traditional costumes sang carols and took part in festive processions on the streets. \nUkrainians decorate a Christmas tree near the Independence Square in Kyiv, Ukraine\nIn recent years many worshippers have joined the OCU but millions still follow the historically Russia-linked Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC), and so will continue to celebrate Christmas on 7 January. \nThe UOC says that in 2022 it split from Moscow because of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine although many people remain sceptical.\nAnd of course there are expected to be quite a few Ukrainians who will be celebrating twice - the more the merrier. \n All pictures are subject to copyright."}

He organised a series of train journeys so they could escape occupied Czechoslovakia and reach the United Kingdom.\nThe film details his heroic work in the late 1930s, as well as his reflections in later life when his untold story was revealed to the public on the BBC One show That's Life in 1988. Johnny Flynn and Sir Anthony Hopkins play the younger and older Winton.\n(In UK cinemas from 1 January)\nEmma Stone plays a woman who embarks on a journey of emotional and sexual development in Yorgos Lanthimos's often surreal adaptation of the book by Alasdair Gray.\nIt won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival in September and is expected to be firmly in contention for best picture at the Oscars. Emma Stone is one of the favourites to pick up the best actress award.\n(12 January)\nMean Girls has enjoyed many incarnations over the last few decades. It began life as a book Queen Bees and Wannabees which was partly the basis for the famous 2004 comedy film. That movie famously and hilariously explored the pressures of cliques and fitting in at high school.\nAfter that, it was made into a Broadway musical, which has now been turned into this new movie. Tina Fey who wrote and starred in the original film returns to do the same here 20 years later.\n(17 January)\nA curmudgeonly teacher at an exclusive boys' school in the 1970s reluctantly finds himself having to look after a group of students who aren't able to return home for the holidays. The film sees writer director Alexander Payne reunited with Paul Giamatti, nearly 20 years after Sideways.\nThe Holdovers is a likely best picture nominee at the Oscars. Giamatti could well be in contention for best actor, while Da'Vine Joy Randolph, who plays the school's cafeteria administrator, is one of the frontrunners for best supporting actress.\n(19 January)\nThis story of love and loss stars Andrew Scott and Paul Mescal as two people living in an almost empty apartment block who gradually enter into a relationship.\nScott's character, Adam, is also still processing the death of his parents, and his grieving manifests itself in an unusual but touching way. Both stars could well be in awards contention for what is undoubtedly one of the most moving and affecting films of the year.\n(26 January)\nThis is the second adaptation of Alice Walker's novel and is a big screen version of the hit Broadway musical. The story of a young African-American woman being raised in rural Georgia in the 1900s stars Fantasia Barrino as the central character Celie, alongside Taraji P Henson and Danielle Brooks.\nSteven Spielberg who directed the first film version returns here as a producer, alongside Quincy Jones and Oprah Winfrey. The then-relatively unknown Winfrey starred in the 1985 original.\n(26 January)\nDirector Jonathan Glazer's film about the Holocaust looks at events through the everyday family life of the commandant at the Auschwitz concentration camp.\nLoosely based on the 2014 novel by Martin Amis, its focus on the banality of evil poses difficult questions about how seemingly ordinary people can be involved in committing such evil acts. The film's growing momentum since its premiere at Cannes could see it doing particularly well at the Baftas and Oscars.\n(2 February)\nJeffrey Wright plays a writer who's struggling to get any interest in his books about Greek history. The publishers he has to deal with are only interested in black writers writing clichéd black stories.\nIn frustration he tries to shame them by writing a book filled with black stereotypes - deadbeat dads, rap music, drug dealers etc. - but he's stunned and horrified when it becomes a huge success.\nWriter-director Cord Jefferson's debut film won the top award at the Toronto International Film Festival. Every winner of that award over the last 10 years has gone on to receive a best picture nomination. This isn't expected to break that streak.\n(2 February)\nA biopic about the legendary singer, which follows his life from his rise to fame in the 1960s to his death in the early 1980s. Kingsley Ben-Adir stars as Marley, Lashana Lynch plays his wife Rita.\nAmong the film's producers are Bob Marley's son Ziggy, daughter Cedella, and his wife Rita, while James Norton plays Chris Blackwell, the founder of Island Records.\n(14 February)\nOriginally planned for release in 2023, it had to be delayed because of the Hollywood strikes.\nAlthough the film was finished and theoretically could have been released as planned, stars were not allowed to carry out promotional work during the strike, which led it it being pushed to next year.\nThe first film was a spectacular success. This second instalment is expected to tell the second part of Frank Herbert's epic novel. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya return, while newcomers include Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan.\n(1 March)\nAmy Winehouse is widely recognised as one of the UK's biggest ever musical talents, with tens of millions of records sold and countless awards.\nThis biopic is directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson and stars Industry star Marisa Abela as Winehouse. The film's producers promise the movie will showcase Winehouse's \"extraordinary genius, creativity and honesty\".\n(12 April)\nRyan Gosling will take on the lead role in a film inspired by the classic 1980s TV show which starred Lee Majors as stuntman and bounty hunter Colt Seavers.\nThe plot sees Seavers try to unravel a complex conspiracy after an almost career-ending accident.\n(2 May)\nWriter director George Miller has been making Mad Max movies on and off for more than 40 years, interspersed of course with films at the other end of the spectrum like the heart warming Babe.\nHis previous Max movie Fury Road was his fourth. It starred Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron and won six Oscars. This fifth visit to the world of Mad Max is a prequel centring on Theron's character Furiosa, and stars Anya Taylor-Joy as her earlier self.\n(24 May)\nThis is a sequel to the blockbuster 2015 Pixar hit which showed how 11-year-old Riley was swayed and controlled by the core emotions present in her mind - joy, anger, fear, disgust and sadness.\nIn this follow-up, Riley has now become a teenager, and things look set to potentially get even rockier when a brand new emotion turns up to join the others - anxiety!\n(14 June)\nThe Vandals are a mid-western motorcycle club. And the film follows the group's development from a band of bike-loving outsiders into something far more sinister.\nIt received strong reviews after being shown at film festivals including Telluride and London and stars Austin Butler, Jodie Comer and Tom Hardy.\n(21 June)\nDespicable Me 3 grossed more than $1bn (£780m) at the global box office in 2017, so it was perhaps inevitable that this sequel would eventually arrive.\nPlot details are still scarce, but there have been some suggestions that it will see the adopted children of reformed supervillain Gru (Steve Carell) becoming more deeply involved in Gru and his wife Lucy's (Kristen Wiig) anti-villain league.\n(12 July)\nDeadpool, the foul-mouthed anti-hero, might be something of an anomaly among big screen comic book stars. But he's one who has been embraced by fans.\nThis film will see him being firmly wrapped into the usually much more clean-cut Marvel Cinematic Universe. In this as yet unnamed sequel, Ryan Reynolds returns as Deadpool, and is joined by Hugh Jackman reprising his role of Wolverine from the X-Men series.\n(26 July)\nThis will be the ninth instalment in the Alien film series. It's a standalone movie, set between the original terrifying Alien and its action-packed sequel Aliens.\nLittle is known plot-wise, but it's expected to, as always, feature xenomorphs - savage aliens that reproduce by using face huggers to implant their eggs in living bodies. Ridley Scott who directed the first Alien movie will produce. Fede Álvarez, the man behind the 2013 Evil Dead remake, will direct.\n(16 August)\nIt's been a long time coming. The original Beetlejuice, which starred Michael Keaton as an obnoxious wraith hired to help scare away a house's pretentious inhabitants, was released back in 1988.\nMany of the original cast are back for this follow-up, including Keaton, Winona Ryder and Catherine O'Hara. Joining them will be Wednesday star Jenna Ortega, who wasn't even born when the original came out.\n(6 September)\nJoaquin Phoenix won an Oscar for best actor for his portrayal of aspiring stand-up comedian Arthur Fleck aka Joker in the first 2019 film. At the conclusion of the movie we saw him confined to Arkham Asylum.\nThe trailer for this sequel reveals him still incarcerated, but building a rapport with his psychiatrist Dr Harleen Quinzel (Lady Gaga) before he finally escapes, leading to their relationship intensifying as she in turn becomes Harley Quinn.\n(4 October)\nThe first two Paddington movies are among the most beloved British films of the last decade, thanks to their affectionate, warm-hearted story telling.\nPaddington in Peru, unsurprisingly sees our favourite bear returning to South America to visit his Aunt Lucy, who now lives in a home for retired bears. Ben Whishaw is back as the voice of Paddington, alongside series regulars Hugh Bonneville, Julie Walters and Jim Broadbent.\n(8 October)\nThis is the third film starring Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock, a tenacious investigative journalist whose body also hosts a symbiotic alien life form. Something that gives him both super powers and a vicious alter ego.\nLittle has been revealed about what happens this time around, and at this stage it doesn't even have a title. It marks the directorial debut of Kelly Marcel who wrote the first two Venom films, as well as Saving Mr Banks and the big screen adaptation of Fifty Shades of Grey.\n(8 October)\nFollowing the 2000 original, this sequel centres on Lucius, who we last saw as the young nephew of Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus in the first movie.\nThe older Lucius, played by Paul Mescal, returns after more than a decade in the wilderness. Newcomers to the cast include Denzel Washington and Pedro Pascal, while Connie Nielsen and Derek Jacob, who were in the original, are back.\n(22 November)\nThe story of the green-skinned Elphaba Thropp, daughter of the Governor of Munchkinland, and how she became the feared Wicked Witch of the West has already delighted theatre fans around the globe.\nAnd this cinema adaptation of the hit stage musical has been divided into two instalments for the big screen, with part two set for release towards the end of 2025. Cynthia Erivo plays Elphaba, and other cast members include Arianna Grande, Jonathan Bailey, Jeff Goldblum and Oscar winner Michelle Yeoh.\n(29 November)"}
