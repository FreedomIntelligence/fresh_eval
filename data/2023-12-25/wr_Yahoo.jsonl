After falling more than 35% in 2022 -- the worst decline in more than a decade -- the Nasdaq Composite charged off the blocks in 2023, gaining 41% so far this year (as of market close on Wednesday).Students of investing history will know the market likely has further to run. Going back to 1972 -- the first full year of trading for the Nasdaq -- in each year following a bear market rebound, the tech-centric index has climbed 19% on average, which suggests the current uptrend has room to run.Furthermore, the recent revival of stock splits has investors poring over companies that have split their shares in recent years, as this is normally preceded by years of robust growth. Let's look at two companies that meet the criteria and should be on investors' short lists.One company that should be on investors' radars is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG). The stock has gained 415% over the past 10 years, causing the company to initiate a 20-for-1 stock split in mid-2022. Despite the challenges it faced over the past couple of years, Alphabet has a history of robust financial growth, and 2024 will likely prove to be more of the same.The biggest challenge in 2022 was the steep and rapid decline in online advertising, which generates the lion's share of Google's revenue, but the industry appears to have turned the corner.Digital advertising is expected to grow 11% in 2023, according to advertising strategist Madison and Wall. Alphabet is the online advertising leader, controlling roughly 30% of the worldwide market, according to data collated by online marketing trade publication Digiday. As such, Alphabet is well positioned to ride that tailwind higher.Global cloud infrastructure spending is rebounding, up 16% to $73.5 billion in the third quarter, according to research company Canalys. During the same period, Google Cloud revenue climbed 24% year over year, achieving a market share of 10%. This is Alphabet's second most important growth driver, so the ongoing rebound is a welcome development.Furthermore, Alphabet was quick to pounce on the opportunity represented by generative artificial intelligence (AI), which brings with it the promise of greater productivity for its users. As one of the \"Big Three\" cloud providers, Google Cloud offers the perfect venue to offer AI services to its cloud customers.Speaking of AI, Alphabet has also been quick to infuse many of its most popular products and services with AI functionality and recently released its Gemini AI, which outperforms ChatGPT using a variety of widely used benchmarks.The recovery of digital advertising fueled by its industry-leading search, a rebound in cloud computing, and the opportunity represented by AI provides a compelling case for Alphabet. Here's another reason to buy: The stock is currently selling for 5 times forward sales, a significant discount to its three-year average of 6 times sales. That suggests Alphabet is a bargain when viewed through the lens of its large and growing opportunity.Another stock-split stock investors should have on their shortlist is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The stock has surged 12,420% over the past decade, causing the company to initiate a stock split in mid-2021. And there looks to be much more where that came from.Nvidia pioneered graphics processing units (GPUs), which render realistic images in video games, but that was just the beginning. As a result, Nvidia has long been the leader in the discrete desktop GPU space, with more than 80% of the market.But that was just the beginning. CEO Jensen Huang realized the significant potential to expand the use cases of parallel processing by the GPU, which can conduct a multitude of complex mathematical computations simultaneously. Parallel processing also proved the be a perfect match for the rigorous computational horsepower needs of data centers, helping speed data through the ether. By some accounts, Nvidia controls as much as 95% of the market for data center GPUs, according to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino.With the dawn of AI, Nvidia was able to pivot quickly, offering not only the processors necessary to get the job done, but also the accompanying software that make them work seamlessly. That gave the company the lead in machine learning, an earlier branch of AI. Nvidia controls as much as 95% of that market, according to New Street Research.Generative AI represented another test for Nvidia, and the company showed that it was more than up to the challenge. Nvidia just released the HGX H200, specifically designed for the rigors of generative AI and high-performance computing (HPC). Nvidia says the processor delivers \"nearly double the capacity and 2.4x more bandwidth compared with its predecessor, the Nvidia A100.\"The data center upgrade cycle and the accelerating demand for AI have supercharged Nvidia's results so far this year. For its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29), data center revenue -- which includes processors used for AI -- soared 279% year over year to a record $14.5 billion, and management believes another record-setting quarter is coming due to the persistent demand for AI.Many investors cite Nvidia's lofty valuation of 63 times earnings and 27 times sales as a reason to avoid the stock -- that those metrics fail to take the company's triple-digit growth into account. However, the more appropriate price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) -- which takes that into account -- comes in at less than 1, compared to more than 2 for the S&P 500, showing that Nvidia is extraordinarily cheap compared to its prospects.Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

Celebratory cannons were fired. A royal guard on Arabian horses escorted President Xi to the Royal Palace.The warm reception during the visit last December was symbolic of deepening ties between China and Saudi Arabia. Long one of the US’s closest allies in the Middle East, Beijing is trying to woo the Kingdom towards the East – and Saudi leader Mohammed bin Salman appears open.President Xi has ambitions to challenge the global dominance of the dollar. One way to do that would be to start trading oil and gas in renminbi.Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest crude oil exporter, has traded oil entirely in dollars since 1974. But talks about pricing sales to China, Saudi’s largest trading partner, in renminbi have been accelerating. In November, China made a breakthrough.China and Saudi Arabia signed an agreement to set up a currency swap line worth 50bn yuan (£5.5bn). The landmark deal means Saudi Arabia has free access to a supply of Chinese currency at a set exchange rate, and vice versa for Beijing and the Saudi riyal.Swap lines in themselves are uncontroversial. China has one with the UK, and the deal with Saudi Arabia is small in scale, worth only a fraction of Saudi Arabia’s total trade with China. But the deal is a significant turning point.If China’s oil and gas trade operates in renminbi, it will be outside the Western financial system and effectively unsanctionable.Establishing the framework of a swap deal also allows it to be scaled up relatively easily. While 50bn yuan is small, the total size may well grow.“It’s mostly a signal that Saudi is willing to use renminbi,” says Alicia García-Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at French investment bank Natixis and a senior fellow at European think tank Bruegel.Saudi Arabia is under pressure to accept the renminbi because Russia, China’s largest oil trading partner, already does.The idea of China seriously challenging the dollar’s dominance has been dismissed by many economists as far-fetched. The dollar is still in a different league globally because such a large share of public and private debt worldwide is held in dollars.The US currency is used in nearly half of all payments worldwide, while the renminbi is used in less than 4pc, according to Swift data. The dollar is freely convertible, the renminbi is not and China has restrictions on capital flows.But the number of transactions involving the renminbi is rising at breakneck speed. In the last three years, global use of the Chinese currency in trade finance has tripled. In September, it overtook the euro as the second-most used currency in global trade. Data from the People’s Bank of China shows that, globally, central banks’ use of Chinese swap lines has roughly quadrupled since 2020.“It is making exponential gains in the share of trade finance,” says Phyllis Papadavid, senior research advisor at Asia House. “It is making gains in its use as a reserve currency. The overall share is still quite low, but the trajectory is very rapid.”In several decades’ time, it is feasible that the renminbi could challenge the dollar, says Julia Gurol-Haller, lecturer at the Chair for International Relations at Freiburg University.“I think in the very, very long run this could be something that manifests.”In the more immediate future, China may be able to protect its energy security as tension with the US intensifies.“It takes the dollar out of the loop,” says Christopher Vassallo, a researcher at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis. “If China wants to pay Saudi Arabia for a certain amount of oil imports, they can use their currency.”This has become a mounting concern for Beijing since the onset of the war in Ukraine.“Beijing watched Washington impose sanctions on Russia’s dollar reserves that simply made the dollar not useful for Russia,” Vassallo says.President Xi is more vulnerable to financial sanctions than Vladimir Putin because China’s economy is much more dependent on imports and exports. Boosting renminbi trade with allies helps to insulate China from any US intervention.“In the short-term, it’s about the security of energy needs,” says Gurol-Haller.The lynchpin of this strategy is the Middle East – and Saudi Arabia knows it.“I was in Riyadh when the war broke out in Ukraine and you could immediately see this new self-consciousness rising, this sense that this is our moment,” says Gurol-Haller. “Countries in the region realised they can leverage relations with other big players in a different way.”Before the war, Saudi Arabia operated a hedging strategy of keeping both the US and China in balance, says Gurol-Haller. “Since February 2022, we have seen quite a pivotal shift towards China as an economic partner.”China is the number-one destination for Saudi exports by value and the Kingdom is China’s second-largest oil supplier, after Russia.In addition to oil, the two nations have deepened their ties in the tech and science sectors, and Saudi Arabia is turning towards China for security.In March, China brokered a reconciliation deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran, leaving the US on the sidelines.“That shows that China is no longer viewed by regional players as just an economic partner but also as a rising political or security force,” says Gurol-Haller. “That is a paradigm shift.”In the same month, Saudi Arabia agreed to join the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, a security union that includes China and India. This summer, Saudi Arabia was invited to join the Brics alliance of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.Brics members have been discussing how to make a common currency that can be used in emerging markets.Gurol-Haller says: “It is discussed so much among this growing, non-Western or anti-US, bloc. It is the finance side to a larger geopolitical phenomenon, which is to reduce dependency from the United States in terms of security and the economy, and then also in terms of currency.”The next step for China and Saudi Arabia could be potential stock exchange partnerships. In February, Hong Kong chief executive John Lee travelled to Saudi Arabia in a bid to encourage the national oil giant, Saudi Aramco, to pursue a secondary listing in Hong Kong.“The overall momentum of this building of an anti-Western bloc will create geopolitical implications for the US,” says Gurol-Haller. “In the Middle East, we already see a diminishing role of the US. That is exactly the phenomenon that such swap lines make stronger.”While dollar dominance persists for now, the Beijing-Riyadh alliance shows its primacy will not continue unchallenged.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

But the decision by the Federal Reserve Bank to pause its interest rate increases has many on Wall Street now calling for a so-called soft landing -- or getting inflation under control without causing a recession.There's more good news. While the Nasdaq Composite has already gained 43% so far this year (as of market close on Thursday), history suggests there's more to come. Over the past 51 years, in the year following a market recovery, the Nasdaq has surged an additional 19% on average, which suggests there's likely more gains to come.Leading the pack this year have been the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Each has deep ties to artificial intelligence (AI) and all have outpaced the broader market by a country mile:Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA): Up 235%Meta Platforms: Up 194%Tesla: Up 107%Amazon: Up 83%Microsoft: Up 59%Alphabet: Up 56%Apple: Up 50%Wall Street rarely agrees on anything, but most market watchers agree that one of the Magnificent Seven is best situated to profit from the rapid adoption of AI: Nvidia. While the stock has already soared so far this year, the evidence suggests it could outperform over the longer term -- and the stock isn't as expensive as you might think.It's worth stepping back for a minute to look at the big picture. While AI represents a massive opportunity for Nvidia, it's far from the only one. The company first introduced the modern graphics processing unit (GPU) 25 years ago, which transformed the video game market by rendering lifelike images, replacing the boxy figures gamers had come to expect. Nvidia has parlayed that early success into a dominant share of the discrete desktop GPU space, recently controlling more than 80% of the market, according to Jon Peddie Research (via Tom's Hardware).Over the years, the secret to Nvidia's success has been its ability to adapt its technology to new and lucrative use cases. This all hinges on parallel processing, or the ability to break up massive computing jobs into smaller, more manageable pieces.The company soon discovered that the ability to process a multitude of complex mathematical calculations could be used in other computationally demanding use cases. Nvidia quickly developed solutions for a wide range of these applications, including cloud computing, data centers, autonomous driving, and most recently AI. Furthermore, by relentlessly improving its technology and including software that makes its processors work even more efficiently, Nvidia created an economic moat that it maintains to this day.The ability to pivot and constantly develop new use cases has helped fuel the stock's relentless climb higher, having gained 12,380% over the past 10 years. That's also why AI is just the latest in a long line of breakthroughs fostered by Nvidia's technology and why its processors are the gold standard in a wide variety of these use cases.You need only examine Nvidia's results to understand the degree of its importance in the advent of AI. In Nvidia's fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29), the company generated record revenue of $18.1 billion, up 206% year over year, while its diluted earnings per share of $3.71 surged 1,274%. Investors shouldn't expect results of that magnitude to continue, as the results are skewed by last year's downturn. But it does help illustrate the accelerating demand for Nvidia's groundbreaking AI chips.The company expects the current tidal wave of growth to continue. For its upcoming fiscal fourth quarter, Nvidia is forecasting record revenue of $20 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, which would represent an increase of 230% year over year. Management left no doubt that AI was behind its bullish outlook.Estimates vary widely, so there's simply no way to know for sure how big the market for AI will ultimately grow, yet even the more conservative estimates are eye-catching. The Generative AI market could grow to $1.3 trillion by 2032, achieving a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.Nvidia was already the undisputed leader in machine learning (an earlier branch of AI) with 95% of that market, according to New Street Research.As the leading provider of AI solutions of all kinds, Nvidia has the most to gain from this secular tailwind.AI isn't the only potential growth driver.There has been an uncharacteristic growth slump in the gaming market, the result of economic headwinds, but they are abating. The global gaming GPU market is expected increase from $2.7 billion this year to $11.7 billion by 2028, a CAGR of 34%, according to market researcher Mordor Intelligence. As the industry leader, Nvidia will also ride this wave higher.The adoption of cloud computing shows no signs of slowing, as businesses shift an increasing number of workloads to the cloud. All that information has to go somewhere, which is fueling greater investment in data centers -- and the need for increased capacity and performance will only grow as more companies integrate AI into their operations. This, in turn, will fuel a data center upgrade cycle. Estimates suggest that Nvidia has a 95% share of the GPUs used by the data center market, according to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino.Furthermore, the data center market will continue expanding and is expected to grow from $263 billion last year to $603 billion by 2030, a CAGR of 11%, according to Prescient and Strategic Intelligence Market Research. This helps illustrate another large and profitable opportunity for Nvidia.As the leading provider of processing solutions for gaming, cloud computing, data centers, and AI, the future is bright for Nvidia -- and its investors.Let's talk about the elephant in the room, Nvidia's valuation. The stock is currently selling for 65 times earnings and 27 times sales, which might seem outrageous at first glance. But it fails to capture an important factor: growth. As previously mentioned, the company has generated two successive quarters of triple-digit growth, which skews those metrics to the upside, making the stock look extraordinarily expensive.However, the highly appropriate price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) -- which takes that growth into account -- is less than 1, compared to more than 2 for the S&P 500, which shows how cheap the stock really is.There's little question the accelerating demand for generative AI will continue well into the future. Add to that Nvidia's dominant position in gaming, data centers, and machine learning, and it's clear Nvidia is the Magnificent Seven stock to buy in 2024 if you can only buy one.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

However, understanding how Roth IRA contributions are taxed is crucial for making informed financial decisions. Let’s break down the marginal tax rate, compare Roth IRAs to traditional IRAs, delve into the taxation of Roth IRA contributions and examine whether Roth IRA withdrawals are ever taxed.A financial advisor can help you set up and manage a Roth IRA. Match with a fiduciary advisor today.To comprehend how Roth IRA contributions are taxed, you must first understand the concept of marginal tax rates or tax brackets. Your marginal tax rate is the percentage of tax you pay on each additional dollar of income you earn. In the United States, the tax system is progressive, meaning that as your income increases, the percentage of tax you pay also increases.Marginal tax rates are structured in a way that each portion of your income falls into a specific bracket, and each bracket has its own tax rate. For example, the first portion of your income may be taxed at a lower rate, while the portion that exceeds a certain threshold is taxed at a higher rate.Marginal Tax Rates for 2023Tax RateSingle FilersMarried Filing JointlyHeads of Households10%≤ $11,000≤ $22,000≤ $15,70012%> $11,000> $22,000> $15,70022%> $44,725> $89,450> $59,85024%> $95,375> $190,750> $95,35032%> $182,100> $364,200> $182,10035%> $231,250> $462,500> $231,25037%> $578,125> $693,750> $578,100It’s crucial to know your marginal tax rate because Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning you’ve already paid income tax on the money you contribute. How much federal income tax you’ve paid on that money will depend on your tax bracket.Now, let’s compare Roth IRAs to traditional IRAs, which allow you to make tax-deductible contributions. This means you can reduce your taxable income for the year in which you make the contribution. However, when you withdraw funds from a traditional IRA in retirement, those withdrawals are subject to ordinary income tax.This stands in contrast to Roth IRAs, where contributions are made with after-tax dollars and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.However, not everyone can contribute to a Roth IRA. These accounts are subject to specific income limits. In 2023, single taxpayers and heads of households who earn more than $153,000 cannot make Roth IRA contributions. The same applies to married couples filing jointly who earn more than $228,000.In 2024, the Roth income limits will increase to $161,000 for singles and heads of households and $240,000 for married couples filing jointly.The choice between a Roth and a traditional IRA ultimately depends on both your current financial situation and your expectations for the future. If you project that your marginal tax rate will be higher in retirement than it is now, a Roth IRA may be the better option, as it allows you to lock in your current tax rate. However, if you anticipate a lower tax rate in retirement, a traditional IRA might provide more immediate tax benefits.Since Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, the money you put into your account will have been taxed at your marginal tax rate. However, in return for paying taxes up front, your savings grow tax-free within your account.The tax benefits continue when you start taking withdrawals from your Roth IRA. While contributions may always be withdrawn tax-free, any money earned in the Roth IRA have to meet specific conditions for tax-free status. To enjoy completely tax-free withdrawals, your distributions must be “qualified.” To be considered qualified, your Roth IRA must have been open for at least five years, and you must be at least 59 ½ years old, permanently disabled or using the money for a first-time home purchase (up to a limit).This is a significant advantage over traditional IRAs, where you would typically pay taxes on your earnings when you withdraw them in retirement. But unlike money contributed to a traditional IRA, Roth contributions do not lower your taxable income for the year.Keep in mind that contributing more than the annual limit could trigger a 6% excess contribution penalty. For example, if you put $7,200 in a Roth IRA in 2023, you would have exceeded the IRS’s limit of $6,500 by $700. In that scenario, you would owe a 6% penalty on the excess money every year until it – and any earnings the money generates – are removed from your account.Generally, Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free. However, there are some specific situations where you might encounter taxes or penalties.Should you need to access your Roth IRA funds before reaching age 59 ½ or before the account has aged five years, you can generally withdraw your original contributions without incurring taxes or penalties. However, any earnings on those contributions that you withdraw may be subject to income tax and a 10% early withdrawal penalty. This penalty can be waived in certain situations, such as for first-time home purchases or qualified education expenses.Roth IRAs can be a valuable component of your retirement savings strategy, providing the potential for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Understanding how Roth IRA contributions are taxed is essential for making the most of this retirement account. Your marginal tax rate plays a crucial role in this, and you should consider your current and future tax situation when choosing between a Roth and a Traditional IRA. Additionally, it’s important to be aware of the rules and restrictions to ensure you don’t incur unexpected taxes or penalties when making withdrawals.You don’t have to check your IRA or 401(k) balance every day, but it’s important to periodically track the progress you’re making toward your retirement goals. SmartAsset’s retirement calculator can help you get a sense of how much your savings could be worth in the future and how much you may need to support your lifestyle in retirement.A financial advisor can help you plan and save for your golden years.

{"date": "2023-12-25-17-19", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/bull-market-coming-2-stock-114500620.html", "text_blocks": "Technically speaking, the benchmark S&P 500 index has been in a bear market since falling more than 20% from its all-time high in 2022.Some Wall Street analysts have already called it the beginning of a new bull market because the S&P 500 since climbed more than 20% from its October 2022 low point. But a consensus won't be reached until the index logs a new all-time high. Here's the good news: It only has to gain another 0.5% to get there.With that in mind, history suggests 2024 is almost certain to be another positive year for the S&P 500, which would all but guarantee a new bull market by every definition. Here's why investors might want to welcome the new year with shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD).Google was founded in 1998, and it came public in 2004 valued at $23 billion. It began trading under Alphabet in 2015 because the company had essentially become a conglomerate, following several acquisitions like YouTube and Waymo, and the important internal expansion into cloud computing.Today, Alphabet is worth nearly $1.8 trillion, and that incredible value creation prompted management to execute two stock splits since 2014 to ensure its stock remained accessible to small investors. Those investors might be thankful this year, because Alphabet gained 60%, which is more than twice the return of the S&P 500 -- and 2024 could be another strong year.Google search remains Alphabet's largest source of revenue. It struggled over the last 18 months with a challenging economic environment, but with interest rates poised to fall next year, businesses will likely ramp up their advertising spending once again. That could reignite Google's search revenue and drive growth for Alphabet overall.But artificial intelligence (AI) has been another challenge. Alphabet entered 2023 on the back foot as Microsoft acquired a $10 billion stake in leading start-up OpenAI. Microsoft immediately integrated ChatGPT into its Bing search engine, and it threatened to change the way people find information on the internet -- prompting a chatbot and receiving direct answers is far more convenient than sifting through web pages.But Alphabet rose to the occasion and launched its own chatbot called Bard. It also embedded AI into the traditional Google search experience, and users will now find the information they seek at the top of the search results without having to click through to any web pages. But December marked Alphabet's biggest leap forward in AI so far with the release of its new Gemini model.Gemini's multimodal capabilities -- like creating and understanding text, images, videos, and computer code -- appear to outperform OpenAI's latest GPT-4 models, according to statistics released by Alphabet. It could be a game changer for the company, especially for Google Cloud because it faces fierce competition from the highly successful Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service, and Amazon Web Services, which features a growing number of models.But valuation might be the biggest story for Alphabet heading into the new year. The company is on track to deliver $5.74 in earnings per share for 2023, and based on its stock price of $140.42, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 24. That's a 17% discount to the Nasdaq-100 technology index, and it's also 32% cheaper than Microsoft's P/E of 36. I think Alphabet has the pedigree to trade alongside its AI rival, so investors might enjoy another year of strong upside in 2024.Advanced Micro Devices was founded in 1969, and it went public in 1972. Its stock has since delivered a blockbuster gain of 24,150%, prompting management to execute six stock splits since 1978 to ensure it remains accessible to smaller investors. But it could be set for substantial gains going forward, too, as it races to catch its rival Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) in the race to develop AI data center chips.AMD is one of the largest chip companies in the world. Its hardware powers some of the most popular consumer electronics, including the Sony PlayStation 5, which just crossed 50 million units sold. AMD's chips can also be found in the infotainment centers inside Tesla's electric vehicles. But the company's largest-ever opportunity will likely be in the data center.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says there is $1 trillion worth of existing data center infrastructure that needs upgrading to support accelerated computing and AI. His company has a dominant share in that market thanks to its powerful H100 graphics processor (GPU) and the upcoming H200. But AMD is launching a challenge with its new lineup of data center chips designed for AI workloads, called the MI300.It comes in a few configurations; the MI300X is a pure GPU, whereas the MI300A combines GPU and central processor (CPU) chips to create the world's first accelerated processing unit (APU) for data centers. AMD has already started shipping the MI300A to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for its new El Capitan supercomputer, which is expected to be the most powerful in the world when it comes online next year.In fact, 2024 could be the biggest year ever for AMD's data center segment, because it expects to exceed $2 billion in sales from GPUs alone.AMD delivered a lackluster financial performance in 2023, as consumers spent less on computers and devices under the weight of high inflation and rising interest rates. But Wall Street is forecasting $3.73 in earnings per share in 2024, representing 40% growth at the bottom line. That would place AMD stock at a forward P/E ratio of 37.4, which is a premium to the current 29.6 P/E of the Nasdaq-100.However, AMD estimates the market for its AI data center chips will grow to $400 billion by 2027, so next year's sales will barely scratch the surface of its opportunity. Paying a premium for AMD stock today might actually seem like a total bargain looking back on this moment a few years from now.Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

He's called the Oracle of Omaha, but even Buffett knows that such near-term predictions usually fall short.But I'm about to give it a shot anyway. I fully realize the folly of attempting something that Buffett wouldn't do. However, I nonetheless predict that three of the stocks he owns will be his biggest winners in 2024. Here are those stocks (listed in alphabetical order), along with why I have great expectations for each one.American Express (NYSE: AXP) emerged as one of Buffett's best-performing stocks this year. Shares of the financial services giant were in negative territory as recently as October. However, a fourth-quarter surge now has the stock on track to finish 2023 up more than 25%.I think that AmEx's momentum will continue into the new year. Why? For one thing, business is booming. The company reported its sixth consecutive quarter of record revenue in the third quarter. Its earnings per share soared 34% year over year to an all-time high.Macroeconomic factors also appear to bode well for American Express in 2024. Inflation, although still higher than the Federal Reserve would like it to be, has moderated considerably. Unemployment levels are low historically. And the prospects for the Fed to cut interest rates next year appear to be pretty good.These should be tailwinds for other Berkshire holdings as well, notably including payment processing leaders Mastercard and Visa. However, I picked American Express as a likely bigger winner in large part because of its low valuation. Its shares currently trade at less than 14.8 times expected earnings.D.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI) has been an even more impressive winner for Buffett this year than American Express. Shares of the homebuilder have skyrocketed by nearly 70%. As was the case with AmEx, most of those gains came in the final two and a half months of the year.I predict D.R. Horton will be one of the best Buffett stocks of the new year for a couple of reasons. The first ties in with the macroeconomic factors that should help American Express. In particular, I think that the potential for interest rate cuts could boost home sales, especially in the second half of 2024.The second is that there's still an acute housing shortage in this country. Bank of America published a paper a few months ago that stated the U.S. needs another 4 million houses.D.R. Horton is uniquely positioned to benefit from lower interest rates and the need for more housing. It's the largest homebuilder by volume in the country, a distinction it has held since 2002. The company operates in 33 states.What's more, the stock is cheap -- especially considering the company's growth prospects. D.R. Horton's price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is a low 0.64.Unlike American Express and D.R. Horton, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) hasn't been a great stock for Buffett in 2023. However, I think that sets the stage for a much better performance in 2024.First of all, Occidental's valuation is attractive. Its shares trade at only 11.3 times expected earnings. I suspect this will entice Buffett to buy even more of the stock in 2024. Berkshire secured regulatory approval to acquire up to 50% of the company's shares. So far, it has bought 27.2%.I think there's a real possibility that Berkshire will aggressively add to its stake in Occidental in the coming months. If this happens, it could ignite a broader buying frenzy that pushes the stock price much higher.Of course, Occidental's fortunes hinge on oil prices. However, Goldman Sachs projects that Brent crude will hit $85 per barrel by mid-2024. That's higher than the current price of a little under $77 per barrel. If Goldman Sachs is right, Occidental should be in good shape in 2024 -- and so should Buffett.Should you invest $1,000 in Occidental Petroleum right now?Before you buy stock in Occidental Petroleum, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Occidental Petroleum wasn't one of them.

After the brutal sell-offs they endured in 2022, many of their stocks recovered as OpenAI's ChatGPT renewed interest in artificial intelligence (AI).Investors might differ on whether traders are in another bull market. Whatever the answer is to that question, many of these stocks will likely keep moving higher in 2024 as interest rates fall and confidence rises.To that end, here's why these three Motley Fool contributors think investors might want to consider Twilio (NYSE: TWLO), UiPath (NYSE: PATH), and CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ: CRWD).Justin Pope (Twilio): Cloud-based communications company Twilio has had an excellent year, up 55% in 2023. That's a step in the right direction, though shares are still down 80% from their former high.So, what's been the problem? Revenue growth slowed, and Wall Street got fed up with the business losing money.Management heard the message and began focusing on cutting costs to turn the ship around. You can see below that free cash flow has exploded in the right direction, and now the business is posting an adjusted profit. Wall Street rewarded Twilio's turnaround, but revenue growth must improve for the stock's ascension to continue.Fortunately, there are reasons for optimism. Scan the technology sector, and you'll see many companies that saw growth slow over the past two years.Surging interest rates designed to slow inflation (and corporate spending in the process) are primarily to blame. While revenue growth slowed, Twilio has continued growing its customer base. It had 306,000 active accounts as of the third quarter, up from 250,000 two years ago.And it recently launched CustomerAI, a service that uses AI and real-time data from Twilio's engagement platforms to personalize insights and marketing for individual customers. Twilio could see growth come back some when corporate spending loosens up again. Analysts see revenue growing to $5 billion by 2025, up from $4.1 billion over the last 12 months.Analysts believe Twilio's improving profitability will generate annual earnings growth averaging 45% over the next several years. Meanwhile, the stock trades at just 36 times earnings, a favorable price/earnings-to-growth ratio of 0.8. The bottom line is that Twilio's comeback story should stretch beyond 2023.Will Healy (UiPath): Cathie Wood called robotics one of the 14 transformative technologies that will change the world. Such innovations tend also to benefit investors, and in the robotics realm, the company most likely to drive such returns is UiPath.UiPath is a software company leading the way in robotic process automation (RPA). Its software bots perform repetitive tasks and serve as virtual assistants, and AI drives many of these processes.The company stands out from competitors through its UiPath Community, which provides free training, tools, and support to more than 2 million users. This fosters engagement and an exchange of ideas within its ecosystem, which has the effect of reinforcing the company's software as the standard.To this end, it attracted almost 2,000 customers that spent $100,000 or more on the platform as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Oct. 31). Moreover, management reported net dollar retention of 121%, meaning customers on the platform for more than one year increased spending by an average of 21% over the previous year.That helped increase revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 to $903 million, 20% higher than one year ago. The company also reduced its net loss over the period to $124 million, down from a $301 million loss during the same period in fiscal 2023.Nonetheless, stock-based compensation led to that loss. With $183 million in adjusted free cash flow over the previous three quarters and around $1 billion in cash, UiPath does not need outside funding.With that financial stability and its AI-driven niche, the stock has risen by about 95% in 2023. And since analysts predict rising revenue for the foreseeable future, that increase will most likely continue in 2024.Lastly, its valuation indicates it is not too late to buy the robotics stock. At a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 12, the multiple is low by historical standards, likely setting the stage for more AI-driven gains.Jake Lerch (CrowdStrike Holdings): It's been a year to remember for CrowdStrike Holdings. Up 144% in 2023, CrowdStrike's stock is the third-best performer within the Nasdaq 100, trailing only Nvidia and Meta Platforms.The company, which employs AI to thwart cyberattacks, is seeing demand for its products go through the roof. Part of the reason is that cyberattacks themselves are becoming so widespread.Indeed, in just the past few weeks, MongoDB, VF (the maker of Vans and North Face apparel), and mortgage broker Mr. Cooper Group (formerly known as Nationstar Mortgage Holdings) have all announced cyber breaches that resulted in the exposure of sensitive customer or employee data.What's more, these are only the attacks the public knows about. It's conceivable that many more ransomware attacks -- hacks where cybercriminals demand payment instead of exposing sensitive data or shutting crucial systems -- fly under the radar.CrowdStrike's security modules help organizations by securing their network, data, and endpoints to prevent catastrophic breaches before they happen. The company's AI is trained to examine billions of data points -- learning what behaviors are typical and which are potentially malicious. When a potential hostile action is identified, the AI takes preventative action or alerts security personnel accordingly.Thanks to its cutting-edge technology, CrowdStrike's revenue has soared this year, and the trailing-12-month figure now stands at $2.9 billion. Quarterly revenue is growing at 35% year over year, while free cash flow has a compound annual growth rate of 43% over the last three years.In short, CrowdStrike is riding a tsunami of growth in the cybersecurity industry that should see it continue its stunning growth well into 2024 and beyond.Should you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?Before you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and CrowdStrike wasn't one of them.

{"date": "2023-12-25-17-19", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/even-15-special-dividend-costco-140000531.html", "text_blocks": "Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) has captured the spotlight with its $15 special dividend, which will be paid to shareholders as of record at the close of business on Dec. 28. At first glance, a $15 per share special dividend seems like a lot. After all, that's more than the stock price of some companies.But at the time of this writing, Costco is a $661 stock. And even if we assume Costco slightly raises its ordinary dividend next year, it is still likely to pay less than $20 or even $19 per share in dividends -- good for a forward yield under 3%.Meanwhile, rival retailer Target (NYSE: TGT) has raised its dividend every year for over 50 years. It doesn't pay special dividends. But its ordinary dividend alone has a forward yield of 3.2% -- better than Costco without even relying on special dividends.Here's why Target is a better all-around buy than Costco right now -- and a far better dividend stock for 2024.Target is a traditional dividend-paying stock. It uses free cash flow (FCF) to support dividend growth. And even during downturns, when it doesn't have the FCF to support dividends, it can lean on cash reserves or the strength of its balance sheet to pay dividends and fulfill its promise to investors.Like Target, Costco pays an ordinary dividend. But it's only $1.02 per share. Granted, Costco has raised its ordinary dividend substantially over the years (it has nearly doubled in the last five years). But even so, Costco's yield from its ordinary dividend alone is just 0.6%.Once Costco's cash reaches an \"excessive\" level on its balance sheet, it tends to pay out a special dividend. This has happened four times over the past decade.In the chart, you can see Costco's four special dividends over the last decade, which coincide with a high point in the cash position, except for the special dividend in 2017 (which was more a result of intended growth).On the surface, Costco's strategy makes a lot of sense. When there's room to pay a special dividend, it makes sense to reward your shareholders by directly putting money in their pockets. Special dividends have the \"plop factor\" that an ordinary divined simply can't compete with in the same way.But I'd argue that special dividends are overrated. The value of a quality dividend-paying company isn't to hand out money to shareholders when times are good, but to continuously pay a growing quarterly payout no matter what the economy or the business is doing. That's what makes a Dividend King like Target so valuable. It consistently raises its dividend even if the business faces challenges, which has certainly been the case lately.In the case of Costco, the business has been doing extremely well, and the stock has been a juggernaut. So returning $6.7 billion to shareholders in the form of a special dividend isn't really a good use of capital. A better use would be to reinvest in the business to support future growth.Costco's stock price has outpaced the earnings and revenue growth.As you can see in the chart, Costco stock is up 80% over the last three years, while Target is down nearly 20%. Costco, as a business, has performed much better than Target, so the stock deserves to have outperformed. But to the extent that it has leaves room for danger. In fact, Costco's price-to-earnings ratio is now 45.1 compared to just 17.5 for Target.That's an expensive price for a wholesale retailer. In investing, you typically don't want to buy one stock over the other just because it is cheaper. Or as Warren Buffett famously said, \"It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\"But in the case of Costco and Target, we have two great businesses where one is far cheaper than the other. Granted, Costco will probably continue growing faster than Target. But not to the point where it should trade at that much of a premium.The (very abridged) version of why Target has lagged the market in recent years has to do with its mismanagement of consumer demand, poor inventory forecasting, and poor supply chain management. As a retailer, the worst thing you can do is over-order, and then have to discount items to move products off the shelves. That's a recipe for margin compression, exactly what happened to Target.The good news is the worst is over. Target has worked on a lot of its inventory headaches. It is now keeping a far leaner inventory, even during the holiday season. Target remains an excellent brand that has what it takes to grow over time, with its Target Circle rewards program, expansion of online ordering and curbside pickup, and engagement with its app.The reliability of Target's dividend, paired with its upside potential and inexpensive valuation, makes it a stock worth owning for the long term.Costco's special dividend is basically a 2.2% boost to the stock price -- which is what can happen any day in the market. Only it costs the company billions of dollars and isn't the result of the market bidding up the company's value.I view dividends as an anchor of an investment thesis -- something you can count on no matter what is happening in the market. They also serve as a useful financial planning tool for building passive income and retirement savings. On the other hand, capital gains, or the growth in value of a company, should result from the company's improvements being recognized by the market.A special dividend is like forced capital gains, if that makes sense. If I were a Costco shareholder, I would either want to see a higher ordinary dividend and the elimination of special dividends, or I would want to see Costco reinvest the money it would have spent on special dividends back into the business.The stock is very expensive and will have to justify the valuation with earnings growth. That $6.7 billion could have gone a long way toward driving future growth. Instead, it will be distributed and taxed to investors as a one-time payment that means very little in the long run.Should you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?Before you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Costco Wholesale wasn't one of them.

{"date": "2023-12-25-17-19", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/time-pull-trigger-says-morgan-111722852.html", "text_blocks": "It’s been a bountiful year for the stock market but that doesn’t mean there haven’t been laggards. The biotech industry, for example, has underperformed. While the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (NBI) shows a 3% year-to-date gain, that is still some distance below the S&P 500’s 24% return.Therefore, with investor sentiment subdued, and some SMID-cap biotech firms still needing to raise capital against a challenging capital markets backdrop, Morgan Stanley’s Jeffrey Hung says the setup for SMID-cap biotech exiting 2023 seems “daunting.”That said, there are signs that 2024 could offer an improvement, and as such, Hung is “cautiously optimistic for SMID-cap biotech in 2024.”“Within healthcare, biotech appears to be more attractive on relative valuation,” the 5-star analyst recently said. “Healthcare tends to outperform in environments of above trend and falling inflation, which our economists expect for the near term. The markets imply rate cuts by the Fed in nearly five full 25bp increments over 2024, starting in May… We still like a core position in mid-cap growth names where there is downside protection from approved products with substantive revenues but meaningful upside opportunity when the biotech market returns to reward investors for revenue growth & positive data.”With a more favorable outlook in tow, and meeting the above criteria, Hung thinks it’s time to pull the trigger on a couple of promising biotech stocks, having recently upgraded his ratings for them. So, we decided to give the pair a closer look. Turns out it’s not only Hung who has confidence in these names; according to the TipRanks database, both are also rated as Strong Buys by the analyst consensus. Let’s see what makes them so.Amicus Therapeutics (FOLD)The first stock on our MS-backed list, Amicus Therapeutics, is a biotech research firm focused on developing new pharmaceuticals for the treatment of ‘rare and orphan diseases.’ This class of disease conditions is characterized by devastating effects on patients – and by small patient bases. For biopharma companies, they present a difficult challenge: there will be a market for a new drug, but it will be difficult to make it offset the high overhead incurred in the development process.Amicus has taken up this challenge, and is working on a line-up of new drug candidates featuring novel modes of action – and the company has reached the ‘Holy Grail’ of the biopharma industry, achieving approval and commercialization on two new drug therapies. These are galafold, a treatment for adults suffering from Fabry disease, and a combination therapy, pombility-plus-opfolda, designed to treat Pompe disease after late-onset diagnosis.Having these approved drugs on the market gives Amicus a reliable source of income, and the company’s revenues have been trending upward this year. The bulk of this income comes from continuing sales of galafold, which reached $100.7 million in 3Q23, up 23% year-over-year – and the first time galafold’s total sales exceeded $100 million. Sales of the pombility-plus-opfolda combination therapy came to $2.77 million; this combo brought in just $60K in the prior-year quarter.At the bottom line for the third quarter, Amicus reported a net loss per share of $0.07, based on a total net loss of $21.6 million. This was the lowest net EPS loss Amicus has reported, and beat the forecast by a penny. The company anticipates showing non-GAAP profitability in the 4Q23 report.For Morgan Stanley’s Hung, this adds up to a solid choice for investors. He is impressed by Amicus’ ability to shift toward net profits, and writes, “We expect the company to reach non-GAAP profitability by year-end, and the company has achieved each of its major goals (such as approval of Pombiliti + Opfolda) over the last year. Looking ahead, focus remains on the Galafold and Pombiliti + Opfolda launches, for which we think Amicus is well-positioned. We significantly cut our R&D expenses as we believe development expenses for the company’s early stage pipeline will remain fairly limited for the next 12-18 months.”Accordingly, Hung upgraded FOLD shares from Equal-weight (i.e., Neutral) to Overweight (Buy) while his $20 price target points toward a one-year upside potential of 47%. (To watch Hung’s track record, click here.)Amicus has a Strong Buy rating from the Street’s analyst consensus, based on 7 unanimously positive reviews. The shares are currently trading for $13.60, and the $19.71 average target price suggests that FOLD will appreciate by 45% in the year ahead. (See Amicus’ stock forecast.)Acadia Pharmaceuticals (ACAD)The second Morgan Stanley pick we’ll look at is Acadia Pharmaceuticals, a biotech researcher working on treatments for disorders and diseases of the central nervous system. Like Amicus above, Acadia has reached the commercialization stage, with two approved drugs on the market, and is pursuing an active research pipeline, featuring new applications of the approved drugs and several new drug candidates.The first of Acadia’s approved medications is pimavanserin, branded as nuplazid, an atypical antipsychotic drug currently approved for the treatment of psychosis – delusions and hallucinations – that are associated with Parkinson’s disease. The drug was first approved in 2016, and in the recently reported 3Q23 it generated net product sales of $144.8 million. For the first three quarters of 2023, sales of nuplazid reached $405.3 million, up 6.5% year-over-year.Acadia is continuing to study pimavanserin in its clinical trial program. The company recently reported positive results from the Phase 2 ADVANCE study, which focused on using this atypical antipsychotic as a treatment for ‘negative symptoms of schizophrenia.’ Currently, pimavanserin is the subject of the ADVANCE-2 study, a Phase 3 trial of the drug in the treatment of schizophrenia. Top line results are expected next year.In other important news about nuplazid, Acadia earlier this month won a patent lawsuit in the Federal District Court in Delaware. The case was based on two suits which were filed last October, and alleged that copies of nuplazid being put on the market violated Acadia’s copyright. The company won the suit in a summary judgement, and shares in ACAD jumped 32% on the news.The second approved drug in Acadia’s portfolio is trofinetide, approved earlier this year as a treatment for Rett syndrome. The drug has been branded as daybue and is on the market for the treatment of Rett in adults and in pediatric patients over age 2. Daybue received FDA approval this past March, and launched commercially shortly thereafter. The drug is already generating significant income for Acadia; product sales in 3Q23 came in at $66.9 million.In his coverage of this stock, top analyst Hung notes several of these factors as supportive for ACAD shares, writing, “We upgrade ACAD shares to Overweight (from Equal-weight) as we believe the Daybue launch is likely to remain strong. While management expects the launch to be more linear going forward, we are encouraged by the market opportunity and think the company will be able to identify more patients and continue to grow the Rett syndrome diagnosed population. In addition, last week’s court ruling in favor of Acadia on the Nuplazid patent challenge removes a significant headwind that had been a focus amongst many investors.”Our PT goes to $40 (from $31) from raising our market share estimates for Daybue in Rett Syndrome to 50% peak share (from 40%).”Along with the rating upgrade, Hung’s price target goes from $31 to $40, implying a potential upside here of 27% on the one-year horizon.This biotech has picked up 16 recent analyst reviews – and these include 12 Buys over 4 Holds, to support the Strong Buy consensus rating. ACAD boasts a $34.20 average target price, which suggests a 9% increase from the current trading price of $31.40.

Then, in 2022, macroeconomic headwinds triggered a sell-off that saw many companies lose the gains they'd made the year before.Easing inflation and excitement over high-growth industries like artificial intelligence (AI) have allowed for a recovery this year, with the Nasdaq Composite index up 41% since Jan. 1. However, after last year's unexpected market downturn, it might be a good idea to invest in companies that are not only likely to flourish next year but also well into the future.Tech shares are an attractive option known for their long-term reliability, with the industry expanding rapidly. Here are three growth stocks to buy in 2024 and hold forever.Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) business has exploded this year and has shown no signs of slowing. The company's shares are up 230% year to date, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the preferred hardware for AI developers worldwide.Other chipmakers have scrambled to catch up, striving to develop AI chips that could be competitive with Nvidia's by next year. Meanwhile, Nvidia's years of dominance in GPUs perfectly positioned it to supply its hardware to the entire market and snap up an estimated 90% market share in AI chips.As a result, the company's earnings have surged in recent quarters alongside a spike in AI GPU sales. In the third quarter of its fiscal 2024 (ended October 2023), Nvidia posted revenue growth of 206% year over year, with operating income up more than 1,600%.Nvidia is an excellent long-term option, with its chips used in multiple tech markets, from AI to cloud computing, video games, consumer products, and more. However, at its current valuation, it's also an attractive option ahead of the new year.The chart above shows that Nvidia's price-to-sales, price-to-free cash flow, and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios have plunged since July, indicating that its stock is currently trading at its cheapest position in months.As the world's second-most valuable company, with a market capitalization of $2.8 trillion, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has a long history of delivering consistent stock gains. The company's shares are up 268% since 2018. Meanwhile, annual revenue has risen 68%, and operating income has climbed 106%.Potent brands like Windows, Office, Xbox, and Azure have given Microsoft a powerful position in tech and the funds to continue investing in high-growth markets. In 2023, the company has carved out a lucrative role in AI, achieving a 49% stake in ChatGPT developer OpenAI.Microsoft has used the start-up's technology to upgrade its product lineup with AI. Elements of ChatGPT have been integrated into its search engine Bing, a range of AI cloud tools have been added to Azure, and its various productivity platforms have received new features, such as Microsoft 365's AI assistant Copilot.The smart assistant is available as a $30 add-on to a 365 subscription and is an early sign of Microsoft's long-term plan to monetize its venture into AI. The company has built a massive user base between its various services, presenting almost endless earning opportunities for its AI offerings.The stock's P/E ratio of 36 suggests Microsoft's stock is slightly expensive. However, its command of the tech market and significant growth potential in AI mean it has earned its high valuation. As a result, Microsoft is an exciting growth stock to buy in 2024 and hold forever.Like Microsoft, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has amassed a substantial user base between its different services. In fact, nine of its products have achieved over 1 billion users, with Google Search and Android topping the list with 3.6 billion and 3 billion users, respectively.The company has used the immense popularity of its platforms to become king of the $680 billion digital advertising market, with a 25% market share. Alphabet's ad business has seen its annual revenue climb 107% over the last five years, with operating income soaring 130%.On Dec. 20, shares in Alphabet hit a 52-week high after news broke that the company would be restructuring its business to lean more on AI and offer more efficient advertising.Over the past year, Alphabet has been developing what it calls its most advanced AI model ever, Gemini. The model debuted earlier this month and has the potential to bolster Alphabet's position in the sector, with the technology looking to be more competitive against the likes of Microsoft and Amazon.The chart shows Alphabet's P/E and price-to-free cash flow ratios are lower than some of the biggest names in AI, potentially making it the best bargain of the bunch. Alongside a lucrative position in digital advertising, Alphabet is a growth stock too good to ignore ahead of 2024 and for anyone looking for an investment to hold indefinitely.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

But investors should be careful not to assume that the current year's trends will continue into 2024. Growth stocks, especially, are trading at elevated prices and could be due for a correction in the near future. Three stocks that may run out of steam next year include Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT), C3.ai (NYSE: AI) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA).There's no mystery behind the impressive performance of Riot Blockchain this year. Crypto valuations have been soaring, with Bitcoin's price jumping by more than 150%. Riot has more than just gone along for the ride, however, as its share price is up a monstrous 417%.Riot is a Bitcoin-mining and digital infrastructure company. As the price of Bitcoin goes up, its revenue does as well. In its most recent earnings report, for the third quarter ended on Sept. 30, the company's revenue totaled $51.9 million and was up 12% year over year. Riot, however, still posted a net loss of $45.3 million this past quarter (versus a loss of $32.4 million in the prior-year period).While the company is investing more into expanding its production capacity, the risk for investors is that this stock is still going to depend heavily on the value of Bitcoin, which has proven to be volatile over the years. Unless Bitcoin has another strong performance in 2024, Riot Platforms is a stock that may run out of steam in the near future. Unless you have a high risk tolerance, you're better off avoiding the stock.Artificial intelligence (AI) company C3.ai has benefited from the AI boom this year. Although it doesn't have a chatbot, it provides AI solutions to companies. The only problem -- the growth just hasn't been all that impressive. While investors have seen Nvidia and other companies generate strong growth numbers this year thanks to AI, that hasn't really been the case with C3.ai.Over the past three quarters, its revenue has been within a range of $72 million to $73 million, and there hasn't been a significant increase in quarter-over-quarter revenue. It has largely been flat. The troubling scenario is when C3.ai starts to lap this year's numbers. Last quarter (which ended on Oct. 31), the company's revenue totaled $73.2 million and was up 17% year over year. But if the year-over-year growth rate, which normally gets more attention than the quarter-over-quarter growth rate, gets down to single percentage points, the wheels could come off for the stock.Year to date, shares of C3.ai are up more than 180%, but in recent months they have been declining. That trend could continue into 2024. C3.ai is a risky AI stock to own, and it may have already peaked.Electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla is a favorite for long-term growth investors. The EV market is a hot one to be in, and Tesla is a leading company in that respect. Over the years, its financials have improved, the business is now profitable, and the stock is one of the top ones in the S&P 500.This year, Tesla's stock has doubled in value. But it too faces some challenges heading into next year. The company's recently launched Cybertruck, for instance, won't be profitable until at least 2025, according to CEO Elon Musk.Meanwhile, the company's margins have already been under pressure due to price cuts. Tesla's gross margin last quarter (for the period ended Sept. 30) was just 17.9%, versus 25.1% in the same period a year earlier. In October, Musk also warned investors that \"if the macroeconomic conditions are stormy, even the best ship is still going to have tough times.\"Tesla is the only one of the three stocks on this list that could make for a good long-term investment. But investors need to prepare for the possibility that the EV stock could slow down next year, or even fall in value due to potentially worsening profit numbers and economic headwinds.Should you invest $1,000 in C3.ai right now?Before you buy stock in C3.ai, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and C3.ai wasn't one of them.

That's up 24% from last year, when money market funds held $4.73 trillion in cash.\"While several prominent sentiment polls have turned more optimistic in the last few weeks, this gauge should be a source of comfort to market bulls, meaning that minor pullbacks in the weeks/months to come likely should be buyable given the global liquidity backdrop coupled with ample cash on the sidelines,\" Newton said.He later added, \"Funds might begin to deploy cash in the new calendar year once rebalancing takes place, which might help to fuel the market rally even more.\"That would be especially true if the Federal Reserve begins to cut interest rates next year, which the market expects to happen at least five times. If the Fed cuts, the risk-free interest rate on money market funds will fall in tandem, making holding cash a less appealing alternative to putting the money in the stock market.Ultimately, the growing cash pile suggests that optimism towards stocks isn't as frothy as it might seem, according to Newton, even as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq 100 hit record highs.Read the original article on Business Insider"}

{"date": "2023-12-25-17-20", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/t-stock-buy-reason-122500357.html", "text_blocks": "The last few years have been a miserable time to own AT&T (NYSE: T) stock. Thanks largely to its dividend income, AT&T investors earned a total return of just 13% over the last five years, a span when the S&P 500 drove total gains of nearly 110%. Additionally, the company faces considerable financial challenges because it has to spend heavily to remain competitive with Verizon Communications and T-Mobile.Nonetheless, AT&T has reached a point where it has become too compelling to ignore, and one factor likely makes it a buy regardless of the apparent trials that might otherwise derail the stock.The reason to buy AT&T stock is its compelling valuation. The stock currently sells at a P/E ratio of 7. This is a small fraction of the S&P 500's average P/E ratio of 26. Since numerous technology stocks experienced multiple significant expansions amid the AI-driven boom, such valuations are uncommonly low in today's tech industry.On the surface, AT&T's dividend may bolster the appeal of the low valuation. Its $1.11 per share annual payout now offers a dividend yield of 6.7%. This is around 4.5 times the S&P 500's average dividend return, which has now fallen below 1.5%.Still, investors should approach this dividend cautiously. AT&T slashed the payout in early 2022 after 35 straight years of payout hikes. And considering its $138 billion total debt, the dividend could fall victim to further cuts as the company looks for ways to reduce that obligation.However, even if such a dividend cut leads to selling in the short term, investors need to remember that AT&T is one of only three 5G providers in the U.S. Since the company spent around $17.5 billion in capital expenditures over the previous 12 months, AT&T's network should remain competitive from a quality standpoint.Indeed, AT&T is adding customers. In the third quarter of 2023, the company reported 468,000 postpaid phone net additions and a \"historically low\" churn rate, indicating it largely holds on to current customers. This has left AT&T with a 47% market share, the largest in its industry, and a gain of 2 percentage points over the last year.Moreover, consumer broadband revenue rose 10% yearly while AT&T fiber grew revenue by 27%. This shows the growth is not just confined to its wireless business.Additionally, the AI boom could supercharge AT&T's growth. Since many AI-related functions take place in the cloud, the technology will depend on 5G and fiber networks like the ones owned by AT&T to execute AI-driven workloads. Meeting that need will bode well for AT&T's top and bottom lines and should boost shareholder value over time.Due to improving business conditions, the low valuation makes AT&T a compelling buy. Thanks to a rising market share and the AI-driven need for AT&T's networks, the company and its stock should move higher in the long term.Admittedly, the massive debt is still a concern, and that could lead to another payout reduction or even the possible elimination of the dividend.However, the improving financial conditions could lead to stock gains compensation for the lost dividend income. As AT&T solidifies its market leadership in an essential industry, it becomes increasingly likely that its valuation and stock price will begin to rise.Should you invest $1,000 in AT&T right now?Before you buy stock in AT&T, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and AT&T wasn't one of them.

A sign that his investing prowess has not diminished can be found by looking at Berkshire Hathaway's most recent big win. And that's none other than Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).This \"Magnificent Seven\" stock has skyrocketed 384% in just the last five years, a gain that crushes the Nasdaq Composite index's 125% gain. Some shareholders might automatically think that the iPhone maker remains a worthy investment candidate.I tend to disagree with this perspective. On the contrary, I believe it would be a smart idea to sell Apple stock before 2024. Here's why.Before considering if a stock makes for a solid long-term investment, investors need to understand the setup. In other words, it's important to try and figure out where the stock's returns could come from in the future. If we view Apple's shares through this lens, I think we'll struggle to find valid reasons to believe the stock can outperform the market over the long term, which should be the key goal of active investing.For starters, this is a mature company. Apple's days of rapid sales growth might be a thing of the past. In its fiscal 2023 (which ended Sept. 30), revenue declined by 2.8%. All but one of the other \"Magnificent Seven\" companies posted double-digit percentage revenue growth in their latest quarters. Tesla was the sole exception -- its sales increased by 9% in Q3.The iPhone still provides greater than 50% of Apple's revenue. Leaning on a product that might be close to saturation in its major markets doesn't create ideal conditions for huge gains. Unless Apple introduces a game-changing product that can significantly move the financial needle, it would be best for investors to temper their growth expectations for the company.And based on its current price-to-earnings ratio of 31.8, this is not a cheap stock. Its average ratio over the last 10 years was 20.7. Seen in that light, rational investors probably wouldn't question the assumption that shares are overvalued right now. This doesn't really set investors up well for strong returns going forward.Astute readers may counter my arguments by pointing out the simple fact that Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway remain major shareholders. The conglomerate currently owns 5.9% of the iPhone maker's outstanding shares, a position valued at $178 billion. And I don't think Buffett has any intention of selling anytime soon.There could be many reasons for this. Berkshire Hathaway receives a sizable dividend payout every quarter from its Apple position. And with the tech giant buying back ridiculous amounts of its shares, Berkshire's equity stake keeps rising.The tax burden might also be an issue. Should the conglomerate exit its position, it would be required to pay a hefty sum to the IRS, something that can be deferred through the power of compounding.Based on Berkshire Hathaway's huge cash balance of $157 billion (as of Sept. 30), Buffett is already having difficulty finding attractive places to put big chunks of capital to work. If he decided to exit the Apple position, that would more than double the size of the cash stockpile.Another possible reason why Buffett is staying a shareholder is that he simply believes Apple still makes for a smart investment, even at today's size and steep valuation. Apple may just be a forever stock for him.For the individual investor, though, it's critical to think independently. Don't get me wrong: Apple is arguably the most successful story in the history of corporate America. However, based on the facts, it's hard for me to believe it will achieve outsized returns in the years ahead.And that's precisely why I think it would be smart to sell the stock before 2024.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

{"date": "2023-12-25-17-20", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/prediction-wont-regret-buying-3-114500101.html", "text_blocks": "Investing in higher-yielding dividend stocks can be a great way to generate passive income. On top of that, many high-yielding dividend stocks also offer compelling upside potential due to a dirt cheap price or built-in growth prospects.LyondellBasell Industries (NYSE: LYB), Realty Income (NYSE: O), and Bank of N.T. Butterfield & Son (NYSE: NTB) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors for their compelling combination of income and upside. That's why they firmly believe investors won't regret buying shares at their current prices.Tyler Crowe (LyondellBasell Industries): Chemical and plastic manufacturing has, historically, been a good business for long-term-minded investors. It's a cyclical business, and its profitability can swing based on the price of feedstock, typically oil or natural gas. Still, global demand has grown steadily for decades as people around the world move up the socioeconomic ladder and, inevitably, use more plastic and other chemicals.LyondellBasell has been in the chemical and plastics business for decades. It is the largest manufacturer of polypropylene and polyethylene in Europe, the No. 2 producer of those products in the U.S., and the No. 5 producer of olefins globally.Two things stand out at LyondellBasell that make it a compelling high-yield investment. For one, its shareholder returns have been spectacular. It has grown its base dividend by 22% annually since 2011 and has paid multiple special dividends and bought back considerable amounts of its own stock.The other intriguing element to LyondellBasell is its big push into circular plastic production. It has developed several innovative processes for breaking produced plastics back into base chemicals that can then be used for the production of new products. Management estimates its circular plastics will sell for higher prices than base plastics and have lower feedstock costs. Combined, the two should increase margins and profits.Today, the stock yields about 5.2% with a modest balance sheet and some impressive prospects for growth in the next few years. That looks like a good combination for a reliable and growing dividend for several years to come.Matt DiLallo (Realty Income): Realty Income has been an extremely reliable dividend payer over the years. The real estate investment trust (REIT) has increased its payout 123 times since its public market listing in 1994, including five times this year. That steady growth should continue, making it a no-brainer for income-seeking investors.The REIT already has a great head start on its 2024 growth plan. In October, it sealed a deal to buy fellow REIT Spirit Realty for $9.3 billion. The company expects that acquisition to close early next year. It should boost its adjusted funds from operations (FFO) by over 2.5% per share in the coming year. That will put it more than halfway to its target of growing its FFO per share by 4% to 5% per year.Meanwhile, the combined company expects to produce over $800 million in excess free cash flow after paying its high-yielding dividend (recently around 5.4%). That cash and its elite balance sheet give it ample capital to invest in more income-producing properties. The REIT has been spreading its wings by expanding into new areas. For example, over the past several quarters, it has added data centers, gaming properties, consumer-centric medical facilities, and vertical farming investments to its portfolio. It has also continued its international expansion and added a credit investment platform.Shares of Realty Income have slumped more than 10% over the past year over concerns about rising interest rates. However, that headwind should fade in 2024, given the expectation that rates will begin to fall. The currently lower share price makes Realty Income look like even more of a no-brainer investment right now. It enables investors to lock in a higher-yielding dividend that should keep rising in the future. That income, along with its earnings growth, puts the REIT in a strong position to produce double-digit annualized total returns from here.Jason Hall (Bank of N.T. Butterfield & Son): 2023 hasn't been a great year for banks. The banking collapses of the spring shook the confidence of many investors, while the ongoing pressures of higher interest rates on balance sheets has affected the bottom lines of a few. But one bank that's built well to profit in the current environment, and a future of rates higher than most have seen in decades, is N.T. Butterfield. Based in Bermuda, Butterfield operates there as well as the Cayman Islands, and the Channel Islands off the coast of the U.K. and Europe. Often considered tax havens, these locations are certainly favored by many of the global elite, and Butterfield has had a presence in these markets for well over a century.Despite this long presence as a valued bank in its core markets, since its IPO in late 2016, it's been a bit of a middling investment. Shares are up only 31%, while its dividend-included returns are 88%; however, that lags the market by about more than 60 percentage points.That's partly due to a pretty exuberant IPO debut price, as well as the 2023 banking crisis, but it's also a result of its relatively slow growth profile.But that doesn't mean investors should avoid it. To the contrary, I think it's an absolute steal. Shares trade for less than 7 times trailing earnings, and the dividend yield is almost 5.5% at recent prices. Even its price-to-book value of just under 2 is cheap for this bank based on its incredible profitability. It has earned 26.5% return on equity over the past year, and a 1.72% return on assets. Compare that to JPMorgan Chase's 18.7% and 1.35%, respectively, and you should see why this is a \"back-up-the-armored-truck\" sort of bank worth buying.Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Realty Income wasn't one of them.

For those who look to the past to try to discern what might happen in the future, there could be an intriguing answer to that question. The S&P 500 is poised to do something it's only done three times ever. Here's what history says it could mean for stocks in 2024.Standard Statistics Company, which later merged with Poor's Publishing to form Standard & Poor's (now S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI)), first created a stock market index of U.S. companies back in the 1920s. However, the S&P 500 in its current form with 500 companies dates back to 1957.During its 66-year history, the S&P 500 has delivered positive annual gains roughly 70% of the time. Down years aren't unusual, but positive years are much more common. What is rare, though, is for the S&P 500 to experience a large decline in one year followed by a huge gain in the following year.From 1957 through 2022, the S&P 500 fell by 15% or more five times. The index rebounded by 15% or more in the following year only three times. The most recent example was in 2008 and 2009 with the stock market crash and subsequent comeback. Now, this rare occurrence appears to be about to happen again. The S&P plunged 19% in 2022 but is set to finish 2023 up more than 20%.Even if we look at the indexes that were predecessors to the modern S&P 500, such steep declines followed by significant bounces are infrequent. There have been only five previous times since the 1920s when the S&P 500 and its previous versions fell by 15% or more, then rose by 15% or more in the next year.So has the S&P 500 been like a yo-yo in the past -- falling, rising, then falling again? Nope. Let's look at how the index has performed in the year following a big rebound.In 2008, the S&P 500 plunged over 38% with markets roiled by the financial crisis. The next year, it bounced back by more than 23%. That momentum continued, albeit at a moderated pace, in 2010 with the S&P rising nearly 13%.It was a similar story early in the 21st century. The S&P 500 fell 23% in 2002 in the continued aftermath of the dot-com bubble bursting. In 2003, the index roared back with a 26% jump. The S&P rose more in 2004, but with a smaller gain of close to 9%.The same pattern emerged during the 1970s. In 1974, the S&P 500 plummeted nearly 30%. It rebounded by almost 32% in the next year. The index then rose another 19% in 1976 -- a strong but smaller gain.If history is a guide, we could see the same thing happen in 2024. The S&P 500 could continue its positive momentum in the new year but deliver a performance that isn't as impressive as that of 2023.Unfortunately, there's no guarantee that history will repeat itself. From a statistical standpoint, the trends from the past are virtually meaningless because of the low sample size.Granted, some Wall Street analysts think that the S&P 500 will rise, but at a more modest rate, next year. For example, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) analysts set a target price for the index of 5,000, reflecting an increase of nearly 6% from its current level. Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) expects the S&P 500 to hit 5,100 next year, a gain of nearly 8%. No one knows for sure what the stock market will do over the next year, though.The good news is that long-term investors don't have to be concerned about it. Over a long period, the S&P 500 almost always goes up. As Warren Buffett once stated: \"In aggregate, American business has done wonderfully over time and will continue to do so (though, most assuredly, in unpredictable fits and starts).\" Whatever happens in 2024, the long-term outlook for the stock market should be bright.When our analyst team has an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

There are far too many stocks that offer extraordinary yields of 6% or more -- a level that I'd categorize as ultra-high.Granted, some of those stocks are too risky for many investors. But not all of them are problematic. Here are my four favorite ultra-high-yield dividend stocks to buy for 2024 (listed in alphabetical order).Ares Capital (NASDAQ: ARCC) ranks as the largest publicly traded business development company (BDC). To be exempt from paying federal taxes, BDCs must return at least 90% of their income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Ares Capital has generated a lot of earnings to return in this manner: Its dividend yield currently tops 9.8%.Can Ares Capital sustain its dividend at such an ultra-high level? I think so. The company continues to generate strong earnings. It also has a great track record of 14+ years of stable to increasing dividends.What I especially like about Ares Capital is that it has consistently delivered higher total returns than the S&P 500 over the long term. Middle-market companies' need for capital combined with Ares Capital's solid risk-management process should enable this stock to keep up its winning ways in the future.Energy Transfer's (NYSE: ET) corporate tag line is \"moving America's energy.\" That's exactly what the company does with its nearly 125,000 miles of pipeline. The limited partnership also moves quite a bit of money to its partners via quarterly distributions. Energy Transfer's distribution yield is over 9.1%.Those distributions should continue to flow and grow. Energy Transfer expects to increase its distribution by between 3% and 5% per year. The midstream energy leader is generating more than enough cash flow to fund the distributions.I'm not overly concerned that Energy Transfer's solid gains this year will prevent it from keeping the momentum going in the new year. The U.S. economy appears to be in good shape heading into 2024. Energy Transfer's valuation also remains attractive with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of under 8.3.I also really like another midstream energy stock -- Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD). The company operates over 50,000 miles of pipelines that transport crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, petrochemicals, and other refined products.Enterprise's distribution yield currently stands just shy of 7.7%. What's really impressive, though, is that the company has increased its distribution for 25 consecutive years with a compound annual growth rate of 7%.An additional big plus for Enterprise Products Partners is its consistency. The company has generated double-digit returns on invested capital (ROIC) and strong cash flow per unit during both boom and bust periods.Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) is no doubt the best-known of these dividend stocks. It's a leader in the telecommunications industry with operations around the world. Verizon has also been a stock that income investors have loved for years. With the company's dividend yield of over 7.1%, income investors still love Verizon.There are two main reasons why I included Verizon on the list of my four favorite ultra-high-yield dividend stocks. One is its track record of dividend increases. In September, Verizon announced its 17th consecutive year of dividend hikes.The second is that the company's free cash flow continues to grow robustly, which should ensure those dividend increases keep coming. Just as important, this trend shows that Verizon can successfully navigate a challenging telecom market. I think this is an ultra-high-yield dividend stock that's built for the long term.Should you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now?Before you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Verizon Communications wasn't one of them.

I know that can be stressful and scary as you wonder whether things will turn around so you can reach your goals.Since I don’t know the details of your goals and situation, I can’t say exactly what you should do to give yourself the best chance of reaching those goals. I can, however, share how I help my clients navigate these kinds of big ups and downs. (And if you need help managing your investment portfolio, consider working with a financial advisor.)Cashing Out Is Usually Not the AnswerWhen I use the term “cashing out,” I’m talking about selling out of your investments and keeping your money in cash instead. And that is not something I almost ever recommend.Investing is a volatile endeavor. Sometimes, the market is up. Sometimes, it’s down. Significant swings in both directions are an expected part of the process and not generally a reason to change your investment plan.One of the biggest problems with cashing out is the fact that you’ll likely want to get back into the market. There’s no way to know the right time to return. And the market is up more often than it’s down. So, you’re more likely to miss out on gains by being out of the market than you are to avoid losses. That’s especially true when you’ve just been through a big market decline.Instead of moving in and out, investors should create a plan that anticipates big market swings and strikes a balance between risk and return that’s aligned with their personal goals. (And if you need help managing your investment portfolio, consider working with a financial advisor.)Here’s how I would think about that from your perspective.If you’re ready to be matched with local advisors that can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.Designing Your Investment PlanBefore considering any changes, start by working through the following four variables to design your ideal investment plan:Personal goalsAsset allocationDiversificationFeesPersonal GoalsYou need to be specific about what you’re investing to accomplish. You can start by asking yourself a few questions:What do I want to use this money for?How much money will I need?When will I need the money?How much flexibility do I have and how much risk can I afford?Answering those questions will help you get away from a focus on returns and stay grounded in what really matters, which is the life you’re trying to create with this money. (And if you need help managing your investment portfolio, consider working with a financial advisor.)Asset AllocationYour asset allocation is the balance you strike between higher-risk, higher-return investments such as stocks and lower-risk, lower-return investments such as bonds.It is generally a good idea to have a mix. Stocks are the engine that drives your long-term growth. Bonds provide some stability to help smooth out the ride when the stock market is down.Your asset allocation is the key to being able to weather the ups and downs. When you get this mix right, you can trust that you’ll capture enough gains from the stock market to reach your goals without risking more than you’re either willing or able to risk.DiversificationDiversification is the financial version of not putting all of your eggs in one basket.Instead of trying to pick a handful of stocks or bonds that you think might outperform, you can spread your investments out over many different stocks and bonds. That way, no single investment can sink you.In fact, since almost no one can consistently pick the right stocks and bonds, diversifying your portfolio allows you to reduce your risk without reducing your expected return.Index funds are a fantastic diversification tool. With just a few funds, you can spread your portfolio over almost the entire global market to match nearly any asset allocation you choose.Diversification is a great way to ensure that you’re not taking on any unnecessary investment risk. (And if you need help managing your investment portfolio, consider working with a financial advisor.)FeesCost is an important consideration when selecting investments, especially mutual funds. Diligently minimizing the fees you pay for your investments should increase your returns and reduce your risk. Whether the market is up or down, more of your money will be yours to keep.Next Steps Walk through the steps above, design your ideal investment plan, then see how your current portfolio compares to it.If your current portfolio matches your ideal plan, there may not be anything you need to do right now. The losses you’ve experienced may simply be a temporary and expected part of the process.If your current portfolio doesn’t match your ideal plan, consider some changes. That doesn’t mean cashing in. It means making whatever adjustments you need to make in order to bring it more in alignment with the long-term portfolio you want.Tips for Finding a Financial AdvisorFinding a financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you.

{"date": "2023-12-25-17-20", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/may-price-war-coming-electric-150000323.html", "text_blocks": "Consumers hoping to receive a $7,500 federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credit on a Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) Model 3 next year could end up with a lump of coal instead. But the ripple effect of this change and what it could mean for competitors such as Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) could be much more impactful than investors realize.Specifically, Tesla's most affordable vehicle will no longer qualify for the $7,500 federal EV tax credit after the calendar flips to 2024, when stricter rules on battery sourcing will take effect. The loss of the tax credit will apply to most Model 3 trims. However, the performance trim level will still be eligible, according to Tesla.There are a couple of interesting factors for investors to note. First, it's still possible the automaker could pass on some savings. All Model 3 trim levels will still be eligible for the $7,500 tax credit when leased, per Inflation Reduction Act rules, but it would be up to the financing company to decide whether those savings are passed on to the consumer via favorable lease terms or not.With that said, however, the loss of the tax break on Tesla's cheapest vehicle will almost certainly put further pressure on Model 3 sales. And one thing investors know for sure by now is that Tesla is willing to slash prices to support demand. It's easy to envision a scenario where the loss of these tax credits softens demand enough that Tesla reduces its prices again, setting off another round in the EV industry's price wars.The motive for Tesla to do that is clear. With the tax credit, the Model 3's effective price was just under $35,000, and that price point has been the threshold for shoppers on the fence about EVs due to their high sticker prices. If the company wants to keep demand healthy for its mass-market vehicle, it will be imperative for it to keep the effective price below that threshold.For most investors in EV companies, indications that more salvos may be coming in the ongoing price war are not good news.But that outcome would not be especially problematic for Rivian, which has been building momentum. The good news is that Rivian is one of the few EV makers that has been able to avoid joining the price war so far, and for the same reasons should remain unimpacted if Tesla again slashes prices.The main reason why Rivian has been able to avoid participating in the price war is that its EVs don't directly compete in the segments where Tesla has been slashing prices. Consumers who are willing to pay a starting price of roughly $78,000 for a Rivian R1T (truck) or R1S (SUV) won't be impacted by the price fluctuations of a smaller sedan.Now, if this same price cut development were to happen with Tesla's newly launched Cybertruck, which will more directly compete with Rivian's vehicles, it could have a far different and more concerning impact on Rivian's momentum.Rivian has momentum going into 2024. It just launched a leasing program to stoke demand, has inked a deal to supply AT&T with electric delivery vans (vehicles it previously was selling exclusively to Amazon), and accelerated its production and deliveries. It has also improved its gross profit per unit, and is on track to be gross profit positive in 2024.Price wars will eventually bite Rivian, but because the company only competes in the pickup truck and SUV niches, it should be able to avoid them a little bit longer. That's great news for shareholders this holiday season.Should you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?Before you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Rivian Automotive wasn't one of them.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) reached new all-time highs in mid-December. The S&P 500 is within spitting distance of its own record level, and the Nasdaq Composite isn't far off.If you've remained invested in the stock market throughout the past few years, then 2023 has provided more proof of what history has said countless times before: After bear markets and other significant market downturns, stocks have always recovered and rewarded long-term investors. But for many who lost confidence in stocks during 2022's bear market, 2023 has been frustrating, because it has shown how selling stocks at their lows can ultimately prove counterproductive.Regardless of whether you have a stock-heavy portfolio or are just now thinking about investing in stocks, a look back at the past can reveal a lot about what the best strategy is when stocks are at all-time highs. It's not complicated, and many long-term investors will find that they don't have to change a thing about what they're doing in order to remain successful well into the future.When you look back at past bull markets, you can see that on many occasions, stocks continue to gain ground even after they've made big moves to return to all-time highs. After the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, it took the S&P 500 until March 2013 to surpass its old high from 2007 and hit new record levels. Some investors suggested that after such an impressive recovery, it would be smart to take some money off the table.Yet what happened after that was a nearly seven-year run of success, with the S&P continuing to rise and set records consistently on dozens of occasions between that first new all-time high and early 2020. By the end, the index had more than doubled from its record close in March 2013.The same thing happened after the lightning bear market at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. After plunging in February and March 2020, markets recovered quickly, and the S&P returned to record levels that August. Again, some felt it prudent to reduce stock exposure at that point, yet the S&P climbed another 40% between August 2020 and January 2022 before the most recent bear market began.Admittedly, there have been occasions when stocks recovered to record levels just to fall again. After the tech bubble burst in 2000 through 2002, it took the market seven years to reach new records. Yet the S&P only rose another few percent before the financial crisis took hold.With history as background, there are several things to consider with markets at all-time highs. The right way to approach things right now depends a lot on your particular situation.If you still have a long time horizon before you'll need the money that you're investing, then there's little reason to pay attention to the ups and downs of the market. Keep saving and consistently invest more into stocks, and you'll benefit from what have historically been superior returns.If it took all your discipline to avoid selling stocks at 2022's bear market lows, then pat yourself on the back for having outlasted the downturn. However, look critically at your asset allocation. Did you overestimate your ability to weather a severe bear market? If so, consider a more conservative investing approach. That doesn't mean selling all your stocks right away, but it could mean shifting a percentage out of the market into other asset classes like bonds and cash.Similarly, if you're retired and have been spending down your cash cushion in order to avoid having to sell stocks at lows, then now's a good time to consider replenishing your cash reserves. Again, you don't necessarily want to sell a huge amount right now, but taking steps to give yourself the balance you want is essential for the success of your long-term strategy.On the other hand, if you've been out of the market, you might think now's the worst time to invest. Yet the smart move is still to make some stock purchases, perhaps through a dollar-cost averaging strategy that ensures all of your money won't go in at the absolute top if a market downturn is on the way.Lastly, bear in mind that just because the Dow Jones and other indexes are at or near all-time highs, many individual stocks remain far below their record levels. Indeed, it's the very fact that many stocks are still playing catch-up at the end of a bear market that often keeps driving market indexes higher.All-time highs are exciting, but they shouldn't have a huge impact on your investing. By keeping an even keel and not letting headlines affect you too much, you'll be in a better position to reap the true rewards that await those with a long-term investing mindset.When our analyst team has an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

One focused on gene therapies and retained the Bluebird name; another focused on oncology, and now goes under the name 2seventy Bio. Below, I'll look at what your returns would look like if you invested $10,000 in Bluebird Bio after the split.On Nov. 5, 2021, after the split was complete, shares of Bluebird were trading at around $13. If you'd invested $10,000 into the business at that point and bought at that price, you'd own 769 shares. The timing of the purchase, however, would have been unfortunate: it would have taken place as growth stocks as a whole were starting to come down in value.Shares of Bluebird have been volatile of late, but they currently trade at around $2.50. That would put the value of those 769 shares at less than $2,000, for a decline of over 80%. To say it hasn't been a good investment would be a vast understatement. While the S&P 500 hasn't exactly been a great investment over that period, it's at least in positive territory -- up around 2%.The problem with Bluebird's stock today is that it continues to fall. Investors are eager to unload the stock even though the company recently obtained approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its gene therapy Lyfgenia as a treatment for sickle cell disease.While FDA approval is normally good news for a business, it's not having a positive impact on Bluebird's stock. A key issue is that despite the approval, the FDA has slapped a warning on the label that Lyfgenia can increase the risk of blood cancer. It's particularly worrisome given that a rival treatment from CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Casgevy, which also obtained approval for the same indication, didn't come with such a warning. On top of all that, Casgevy is also priced lower, at $2.2 million versus Lyfgenia's steeper $3.1 million price tag.Overall, that paints a worrisome picture for Bluebird, because it could drastically impact the demand for the treatment. And since a company such as Bluebird desperately needs a strong source of revenue, these developments have drastically increased the risk for the healthcare stock.In the trailing 12 months, Bluebird has incurred operating losses totaling $138 million. During that time, it's also burned through $293 million in cash just from its day-to-day operating activities. That's particularly concerning given that as of the end of September, the company reported cash and marketable securities totaling just over $174 million, along with restricted cash of $51 million.Bluebird doesn't have much cash to spare. If it can't rely on strong demand for Lyfgenia, it might need to rely heavily on issuing debt or stock to help fund its cash balance. And on Monday, the company already proposed a $150 million stock offering. Offerings have a dilutive effect on shareholders, and put downward pressure on the stock price. Investors should expect more of them in the future if Bluebird's financials don't drastically improve.The big hope for investors was that the company's gene therapy would be a game changer for Bluebird Bio, but that hope appears to be all but gone right now. And with a challenging path forward, you shouldn't expect a turnaround in the stock's fortunes anytime soon. Unless you're a contrarian investor with an extremely high risk tolerance, you'll want to avoid this stock.Should you invest $1,000 in Bluebird Bio right now?Before you buy stock in Bluebird Bio, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Bluebird Bio wasn't one of them.

Bangkok's SET was flat. The Shanghai Composite index edged 0.1% higher, to 2,918.93.Most markets in the region and beyond were closed for the Christmas holiday.Chinese regulators announced approvals of more than 100 online games and issued a statement expressing support for the industry after draft guidelines issued Friday caused share prices of major games makers like Tencent and Netease to plunge.On Friday, the S&P 500 rose 0.2% to sit less than 1% below its record set nearly two years ago, at 4,754.63. The Dow slipped less than 0.1% to 37,385.97, and the Nasdaq gained 0.2% to 14,992.97.With its eight straight weekly gains, the S&P 500 is in the midst of its longest winning streak since 2017.Wall Street’s focus was squarely on a suite of economic reports released Friday that led to some swings in Treasury yields.The measure of inflation the Federal Reserve prefers to use slowed by more than economists expected, down to 2.6% in November from 2.9% a month earlier. It echoed other inflation reports for November released earlier in the month.Spending by U.S. consumers unexpectedly rose during the month. While that’s a good sign for growth for an economy driven mainly by consumer spending, it could also indicate underlying pressure remains on inflation.Other reports on Friday showed orders for durable manufactured goods strengthened more in November than expected, sales of new homes unexpectedly weakened and sentiment for U.S. consumers improved.The Federal Reserve is walking a tightrope, trying to slow the economy enough through high interest rates to cool inflation, but not so much that it tips into a recession. A stronger-than-expected economy could complicate the balancing act.The yield on the 10-year Treasury was at 3.90% early Monday, roughly its same level from late Friday. It is still down comfortably from October, when it was above 5% and putting painful downward pressure on the stock market.Falling yields have been a primary reason the stock market has charged roughly 15% higher since late October. Not only do they boost the economy by encouraging borrowing, they also relax the pressure on the financial system and goose prices for investments. They’ve been easing on hopes that inflation has cooled enough for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates through 2024.Traders are largely betting the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate by at least 1.50 percentage points by the end of next year, according to data from CME Group. The federal funds rate is currently sitting within a range of 5.25% to 5.50% at its highest level in more than two decades.In currency dealings, the U.S. dollar fell to 142.41 Japanese yen from 142.49 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1010 from $1.1019."}

The oil market is currently being propped up by OPEC’s production cuts, which have kept prices high and allowed American producers to keep drilling without fear that they’ll flood the market and cause prices to plunge.

The stock has skyrocketed by 235% since Jan. 1 as the company delivered multiple quarters of record earnings.An explosion in demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications saw the tech giant transform from a video games-centered company into one of the most powerful suppliers of data center chips. Nvidia has carved out a lucrative role in the industry thanks to its years of dominance in graphics processing units (GPUs). While competition in the software side of AI has grown intense, Nvidia is cashing in by supplying its hardware to the many companies joining the sector.Despite the run-up in the company's share price this year, Nvidia likely still has more growth to offer new investors. The AI market is expanding rapidly, with chip demand soaring right along with it.Here's why Nvidia is a screaming buy right now.According to Grand View Research, the AI market was valued at $137 billion in 2022 and is expected to expand at a compound annual rate of 37% until at least 2030. Those projections would see the sector exceed $1 trillion before the end of the decade, suggesting there's plenty of room for Nvidia to remain atop the AI chip market and grow even as new players join.Chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have products in the works that will challenge Nvidia's near-total dominance in AI chips in 2024. However, taking a significant chunk out of Nvidia's estimated 90% market share in AI GPUs will likely be an uphill battle. While its competitors have been scrambling to catch up, the company has become the gold standard in AI hardware.Moreover, Nvidia's head start in AI has given it the funds to continue investing in R&D that can help it keep its lead and retain its dominance. Nvidia's free cash flow has more than tripled this year, from $5 billion to more than $17 billion, while AMD's has sunk from $3 billion to $1 billion. And Intel's free cash flow has plunged by 150% since 2020, from $20 billion to a negative $10 billion.In its fiscal 2024 third quarter (which ended Oct. 29), Nvidia's revenue soared 206% year over year to $18 billion, with operating income up more than 1,600% to $10 billion. The company profited from a massive spike in AI GPU sales, as reflected in its 279% rise in data center revenue of $14 billion. AI chip demand is only likely to continue rising for the foreseeable future, and Nvidia is well-positioned to see significant gains for years.There's been much speculation on whether Nvidia can keep up its current growth trajectory. The 235% rise in its stock price this year will be challenging to replicate in 2024. However, a company doesn't have to deliver the same percentage of share price growth year after year to be a stellar buy. And projections suggest Nvidia shares still have plenty of room left to run.As the table above shows, estimates are that Nvidia's earnings could hit nearly $24 per share by its fiscal 2026. When that figure is multiplied by the tech giant's current forward price-to-earnings ratio of 45, it gives a stock price of $1,080, suggesting that if it continues to trade at today's ratio, it could gain roughly 120% over the next two years.As such, new investors could more than double their money over the next two years by investing in Nvidia today. That makes it a no-brainer buy, and one you won't want to miss out on.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

{"date": "2023-12-25-17-20", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/2-small-cap-stocks-could-144500653.html", "text_blocks": "Small-cap stocks have been under pressure ever since the Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in the first quarter of 2022. As a result, scores of companies in this category sport rock-bottom valuations right now. With the Fed possibly set to reverse course on interest rates next year, though, it might be a smart idea to start adding some select names to your portfolio.Which small-cap stocks stand out as the most promising? Although it's important to remember that small growth companies are inherently risky, there are several names that screen as incredible bargains at current levels, especially in the heavily sold-off biotech industry. From a risk-to-reward perspective, Agenus (NASDAQ: AGEN) and Coherus BioSciences (NASDAQ: CHRS) stand out from the crowd. Here's why.Agenus is a biotech that specializes in developing immunotherapies to combat cancer. Wall Street analysts predict that its stock price could skyrocket by 733% in the next year.What's behind this uber-bullish take? One of the main factors is that Agenus plans to submit a Biologics License Application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its lead product candidate, botensilimab, as part of a combination therapy for patients with advanced microsatellite stable metastatic colorectal cancer by mid-2024.This form of CRC has an exceptionally poor outlook and limited treatment options. If approved, this combo therapy could generate annual sales of $240 million to $500 million at peak for Agenus, which is a significant amount for a later-line cancer drug. To further put this preliminary sales projection into perspective, Agenus has a market cap of only $298 million at the time of this writing. Hence, Wall Street's lofty price target may have a solid premise behind it.However, Agenus does have some significant risks to consider. One of the most important is its less-than-ideal financial position. Even after a recent milestone payment from partner BMS, the company appears to have less than two full years of cash remaining. On the bright side, Agenus may be able to attract a partner with deep pockets based on botensilimab's impressive clinical profile in the solid tumor setting.Coherus BioSciences is a biopharmaceutical company that focuses on two areas: biosimilars and immuno-oncology. The company has three biosimilars on the market: Udenyca, a Neulasta biosimilar; Cimerli, a Lucentis biosimilar; and Yusimry, a Humira biosimilar. Moreover, the company recently won FDA approval for its immuno-oncology drug, Loqtorzi, as a treatment for advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Coherus plans to launch Loqtorzi in the first quarter of 2024.Despite its growing product portfolio, Coherus' stock has still plummeted by 74% this year. The main issue is the company's unfavorable cash situation. Coherus has less than a year of cash left at its current burn rate. Now, management has pledged to reduce expenses to move the company back to profitability. But investors appear to be waiting for hard evidence that this plan will bear fruit.Should you invest $1,000 in Agenus right now?Before you buy stock in Agenus, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Agenus wasn't one of them.
