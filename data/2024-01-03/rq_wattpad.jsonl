Colby, ever the optimist, decided it was time to lift Hazel's spirits. He flashed a mischievous grin, hoping to bring back the playful energy they shared.\"Come on, Hazelnut, no more sulking. Let's turn this night around,\" Colby said, attempting to inject some cheer into the room.Hazel sighed, her mood still dampened by the recent events. \"I don't get why Spencer does these things. It's like he enjoys messing with my head.\"Colby, not one to dwell on negativity, stepped closer to Hazel with a flirty twinkle in his eyes. \"Well, lucky for you, you've got me to brighten up your night. How about we forget all the drama and have some fun?\"He attempted a playful rizz, trying to elicit a blush from Hazel. However, her expression remained unchanged, and she seemed more focused on her thoughts.\"Why should I let Spencer ruin my mood? If he wants Vincent to work for him, who am I to argue? I'm just glad Sage can no longer blackmail me with the necklace,\" Hazel mused, brushing off the recent events with a sigh.Colby chuckled, trying to steer the conversation back to a lighter tone. \"Finally, the grumpy Hazelnut is gone. Now, how about we record a quick, fun video for the channel? Truth or drink, perhaps?\"Hazel looked intrigued, a faint smile forming on her lips. \"Alright, let's do it. Maybe it'll distract me from Spencer's shenanigans.\"Colby says \"lemon juice on the counter \"Hazel says \"ayi ayi captain.\"They set up the camera and settled into a cozy spot, ready for their impromptu Truth or Drink session. Colby, always one to bring out the best in Hazel, began with a lighthearted question.\"Okay, Hazelnut, first question, am i a good kisser?\"Hazel, trying to maintain her composure, hesitated for a moment before opting for a shot. She gags cause it was too sour. Colby raised an eyebrow, feigning offense. Hazel smirked, giving Colby a playful side-eye. \"Nice try Mr. Brock.\"\"What? I demand a recount! Alright, my turn. You were a big fan of me and Sam when you were in high school, right? So, did you have a crush on Sam?\" Says colby Hazel's eyes widened, and she took a shot with a playful smirk. \"Hey, not my fault. It's just a high school thing, but I adored both of you. Sam was like the cool and funny one  , you know?\"Colby chuckled, teasingly. \"So, you really had a crush on my best friend. I should've known.\"Hazel playfully nudged him. \"Don't flatter yourself too much, Brock. It was just a phase.\"Colby pretended to ponder the question, wearing a dramatic expression. \"Hmm\"Hazel chuckled, appreciating the banter. \"You're weird. Now, for the fun part. Let's share some embarrassing stories. But if it's too much, we take a shot.\"\"Okay, Hazelnut, spill the beans. How was your prom date?\" Colby asked, a mischievous grin playing on his lips.Hazel groaned, \"Ugh, prom. It was a disaster. My date was more interested in his phone than dancing with me. I spent most of the night trying not to cry in the bathroom.\"Colby winced, realizing the awkwardness of the situation. \"Well, that sounds... awful. I thought prom was supposed to be magical or something.\"Hazel shot him a look. \"Magical, my foot. It was a nightmare. But hey, at least you got to go to prom with Sam, right?\"Colby's expression shifted, and he laughed nervously. \"Uh, yeah, about that. Sam and I did go to prom together, but not in the traditional way. You know, we kind of crashed it.\"Hazel raised an eyebrow. \"Crashed it? How so?\"Colby proceeded to tell her about the Vine they made during prom, showcasing their unconventional and comical approach to the event. Hazel watched the Vine with a mix of amusement and mild embarrassment.\"Yeah, I remember that. It was... something,\" Hazel remarked, her cheeks slightly flushed.Colby grinned. \"Yeah, we were Vine pioneers. Anyway, truth or drink: did you ever sneak out of the house to make out with someone in high school?\"Hazel sighed, realizing the potential embarrassment of her response. She took a shot and replied, \"Well, I tried, but my brother was like a hawk. He never let me do anything. Always ruining my teenage rebellion dreams.\"\"Protective brother, huh? Sounds familiar. \"\"Okay, Colbs, truth or drink: have you ever secretly been jealous of the attention I give to sam in  videos?\" Says Hazel Colby feigned innocence, a glint of mischief in her eyes. \"Well, Mrs. Brock, I'm not saying I'm jealous, but maybe I just want all your attention for myself.\"Hazel grinned, leaning in a bit closer. \"Ah, finally admitting it.\" Colby smirks \"Okay, truth or drink: have you ever been jealous of any of my exes?\"Hazel smirked, teasingly playing with her hair. \"Maybe just a little. They got to know the pre-ghost-hunting Colby, and I missed out on that.\"Colby chuckled, the playful exchange lifting the mood in the room. As they continued the game, the questions became more daring, and the shots more frequent.At one point, Hazel playfully accused, \"You never got me a rose, Mr. Romantic.\"Colby pretended to be wounded. \"What? I'm hurt. Okay, truth or drink: have you ever wanted me to surprise you with a romantic gesture?\"Hazel, matching his playful tone, replied, \"Maybe once or twice. But hey, a girl can dream.\"As the Truth or Drink session concluded, Colby smoothly transitioned into the outro for his video. \"And there you have it, folks! A glimpse into our high school adventures and questionable choices. Don't forget to subscribe to Hazel's channel, link's in the description below. Hit that like button if you want more juicy revelations! Until next time, stay weird!\"Hazel, still processing the whirlwind of questions and shots, playfully rolled her eyes. \"Lemon juice shots were too sour, Colby. You're lucky I didn't throw up on camera.\"Colby chuckled, \"Hey, gotta keep things interesting for the viewers. And don't be too surprised; those questions were easy. We're practically best friends, right?\"Hazel raised an eyebrow, her tone teasing. \"Excuse you, we are not best friends; we are dating.\"Colby, with a grin, retorted, \"Same thing.\"Hazel pouted, crossing her arms. \"Not the same thing.\"After their banter, they settled into a cozy post-recording session, enjoying the food they had ordered and simply reveling in each other's company. The lighthearted atmosphere shifted when Brielle's face appeared on Hazel's phone screen.\"Hold on, guys. Look who decided to call after abandoning their apartment and making us plant-sitters,\" Hazel said, answering the call.Brielle appeared distressed. \"Hazel, Colby, I can't find Sam! He went to get me some flowers this afternoon and hasn't arrived since!\"Colby, concern etched on his face, asked, \"Wait, really? Did he have his phone?\"Brielle replied, her voice shaky, \"Yeah, he had his phone, but he's not answering. I'm getting really worried.\"Colby reassured her, \"Okay, Brielle, stay calm. Call the police, and I'll try calling Sam from here. We'll figure this out.\"As Colby dialed Sam's number, Hazel looked at Brielle through the phone. \"Did Sam say where he was going to get the flowers?\"Brielle shook her head. \"No, he just mentioned he wanted to surprise me. I didn't think much of it until now.\"Colby, still on the phone with no response from Sam, glanced at Hazel. \"Keep Brielle on the line. I'll try a few more times.\"Just as the worry began to escalate, the gate of the hotel where Brielle and Sam were staying swung open. Sam walked in, holding a bouquet of flowers.Brielle, seeing Sam, exclaimed, \"Hold on, guys.\" She quickly hugged Sam, her face lighting up with relief.Sam, looking at the caller ID on the screen, grinned. \"Oh, hey, what's up, Hazel?\"Hazel, a mix of emotions ranging from concern to annoyance, replied, \"Your girlfriend was worried, dude. Where were you? And why weren't you answering your phone?\"Sam chuckled, rubbing the back of his neck. \"Sorry about that. I went to a nearby flower shop, and the owner started telling me these ghost stories about the place. I got so intrigued, I lost track of time.\"Colby, still on the line, said, \"Dude, you scared us. We were about to call the police.\"Sam laughed, \"No need for that. I'm perfectly fine. Thanks for looking out for me, though.\"Brielle, a mixture of relief and annoyance, chimed in, \"You can't just disappear without telling me, Sam. I was freaking out!\"Sam hugged her, \"I know, I know. I'm sorry. But hey, I got you these flowers to make up for it.\"Brielle, despite her irritation, smiled, \"You're lucky these are really nice flowers.\"Colby, now realizing the situation had resolved, teased Sam, \"You owe us an explanation, man. We were on the verge of forming a search party.\"Sam laughed, \"Next time, I'll send you my location in real-time. Sorry, guys.\"As the tension eased, they all shared a collective laugh, relieved that Sam was safe and sound. The conversation continued with Brielle scolding Sam, Hazel making a few sarcastic remarks, and Colby chiming in with his signature humor.As the call concluded, Colby leaned back, shaking his head. \"Well, that was unexpected. Note to self: Sam can vanish for ghost stories without a trace.\"Hazel, with a smirk, added, \"And Brielle will put the whole city on alert if he does.\""}

We need to present the designs tomorrow. What do you think we are going to do?\" Arika asked raising an eyebrow. She hated lethargic work and such unprofessional attitude was not appreciated at all.Arika looked at the wall. It was already 10:30 and the office was almost empty. Moreover, it was not really safe to leave a girl alone at the office at that point of time.\"You take this home. The meeting is scheduled for 7 tomorrow. I need the work done before 2 PM. Understood?\" Arika asked to which the girl quickly nodded.\"Good. Now you may leave. Go home safely.\" She said and the girl thanked her and rushed out of the office.But her attention was immediately caught by her phone which was ringing filling noise in the quiet room.She picked up the call with one hand caressing her forehead with the other.\"Yes Kritika.\" she said applying pressure trying to ease out the growing forehead.\"Where are you. Almost everybody have departed to their rooms. When are you going to come back?\" Kritika bombed her with a series of questions.\"I am just leaving the office. I will be back within half an hour.\" She said searching for a few files she had to carry back with her.\"Okk come soon\" Kritika said and hung up on her.Arika soon left the office and drove back home.As soon as she entered the house, she hoped to see some people chit chatting but to her utter surprise, she found that nobody was there in the hall. In fact even the lights were off and the place seemed really quite.\"Maybe everybody have gone to sleep.\" She thought and then went and kept her bag on the sofa.However, as she went towards the kitchen, she felt a savory smell filling her nostrils.And as she went inside, she saw that Abhimanyu was cooking something, standing in an his formals and an apron on top of it.\"You did not change?\" Arika asked settling herself on the kitchen slab while she continued cooking.\"I asked Kritika to call you and ask. So I thought to make dinner for both of us.\" He said without looking at her, completely focused on the master piece he was preparing.\"Okk, let me just change and come and then we will eat.\" She said hoping down, kissing his cheeks hastily and then running away.Abhimanyu smiled at her antics.He was busy making their favorite pasta, their comfort food, something they made together for the very first time.As he was just done, he switched off the flame and shifted the food in two plates when he heard Arika calling out for him from the dining table.\"Here goes you food madam.\" Abhimanyu said placing it and acted as he was taking off his fake hat like a chef.\"Such a handsome chef. Wahhhaaa I seem to be in love.\" Arika said and giggled at her own words.Abhimanyu lowered his gaze shying away a bit.\"Ohh you look so cute.\" She said laughing.\"Okk now, stop it and eat.\" Abhimanyu sat down on his own seat holding his spoon elegantly.A comfortable silence prevailed before Abhimanyu broke it,\" How's the food?\" He asked looking upwards.\"So tasty! So delicious. Just tasting like a wow!!!\" Arika said replying to him followed by a chef's kiss.Abhimanyu chuckled looking at her. He did not know his wife was well aware of trends.\"Just like you taste\" he said chuckling making her quiet immediately.The two had their dinner in solace and then Arika went to keep the plates in the kitchen.She thought that Abhimanyu must have departed to the room by now but he was still standing beside the table with his phone in his hand, leaning on the wall.As soon as Arika came towards him, he kept his phone aside, pulled her by waist and immediately turned her caging her in between himself and the wall.There was no space left for her to move.\"What..... what are you doing? Someone might come.\" Arika whispered in his ears and tried to push him away but he had other plans for the two of them.\"Stop pushing me and let me do what I want to. Its been so many days. Come on na wifey.\" Abhimanyu urged and she gave into it quickly.He nuzzled his nose in his neck and smelled her perfume.\"I love the way you smell.\" He muttered kissing her neck. Arika moved her face to aside to make more space for him.\"Ohh my darling I love you so much.\" He said kissing her cheek making it red.\"Now, that I have waited so much, I think that I deserve my gift. And you are the sweetest gift I have ever received, directly from god itself.\" He said before claiming her lips in a sweet kiss.He said and changed their positions, this time his back was touching the wall and he had his arms around her waist.\"Someone might come.\" She said breaking the kiss for a second trying to kiss.\"Nobody will come. Everybody is asleep.\" Abhimanyu said walking forward making her move backwards.She looked behind her to see that she was walking close to the dining table.\"Where will you go now?\" he said moving his hand towards her and with one swift movement, he had his hand around her waist and pulling her close to himself.Arika looked at him with a naughty smile of her face, trying to tease him. \"And if I run away, what will you do?\" She asked him raising a brow.\"Don't worry. I will show you.\" He said bending her on the dining table and kissing her again.Arika was laying half bent on the table while she had her arms around Abhimanyu's neck while he hovered upon her.However, their moment was disturbed by the sound of someone clearing his throat.Both of them soon separated and moved away from each other.Arika pushed her hair behind her ears and Abhimanyu spoke in an unclear voice.\"Aga....... Agastya we were just......\" But before he could speak something , Agastya spoke first.\"I just came down to drink water. I am leaving you guys continue.\" Agastya spoke and rushed from there without drinking water.Abhimanyu and Arika looked at each other embarrassed.Agastya rushed from there as if his ass was on fire.\"Let it be. I will ask Rudraksh for water.\" Agastya thought to himself and walked upto Rudraksh's room but again turned his back seeing what was happening over there............................................................................................................................................ A LITTLE LATE BUT STILL, HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE!!!!🎏🎊🎉🎊🎊WHAT DID AGASTYA SEE??

'The Spring sprung collection', Kaili read to herself after picking up one of the 3 magazines lying on a glass center table'There's nothing important here', Kaili whispered to her partner, 'Let's go upstairs'Lan Fen followed them as they walked up the wooden spiral stairs past a crystal chandelier towards a room filled with books and files that stacked high. 'It's a cute room actually', Liya pointed out, 'I'll take this one, you can investigate the bedroom'Once the door closed, she opened every rustic drawer and combed through the shelves of miniature figurines and succulents carefully to no avail. Even she was shocked by the lack of abnormality there was to find amongst the cute stationary and piles of journals, 'Can you excuse me?', Lan Fen began, 'There's someone at the door'They smiled and she frowned slightly, 'Look I'll be honest, I don't want you both looking through my stuff if I'm not here so please-'Ding Dong'I'll go with you', Liya volunteered, 'But Lan Fen, if you have nothing to hide then you shouldn't be scared of anyone looking through your things'The lioness bit back her sharp tongue, the rabbit's eyes pierced hers directly. 'Ever heard of privacy detective?', she hissed back before turning and walking with Liya trailing behind her obedientlyKaili's mind shifted, 'Liya bought me time', she realized, 'But I don't have much to work with'Her eyes pinpointed each area of the room that spoke out to her. The books arranged neatly on the tableThe colours of the figuresThe silver lamp shaped like a jumping fishKaili knew her mind, she knew how it worked. It was strange, but it was different from her colleagues who had intellect beyond her own understanding. 'Your mind is weird', she remembered Ren confessing that to her, 'While others see the little details first, you see the big picture then pick off everything normal until you find the odd one out'At once her eyes lasered in on a drawer just below the edge of the desk, it shouldn't bother her but it did. The cracks that formed at the base and the smudges of crisp white paint, 'That means this one's been opened alot'Her frown returned when she opened it to find heaps of unused stationary boxed up neatly. She sighed and slid it shut when her ears pricked up at the rustle the boxes made. 'That's not right', she murmured, not even blinking when she repeatedly slid the drawer back and forthThe boxes jumped up and downUp and downUp and do-ClinkA new unfamiliar sound made her heartbeat skip, a new wave of excitement washing over her like a riptide ready to conquer the beach. 'There we go', she chuckled, hooking her pinky over a barely visible bronze hook that lay flat agaisn't the inner corner of the drawer. 'And up'A creak jolted the base open and the boxes crashed to the floor lightly while she held together the flimsy wooden base that kept the real one out of sight. Her eyes glimmered with pride whilst she peered inside to reveal a gold file with a cartoon bird flying directly over a koala bear. 'The magpie?', she guessed before picking up the file, 'Oh shit..'The contents were minimal but each page was more important than the last, 'These are..JiHu's documents. Legal documents'Behind was a sub folder for what she assumed were HaoRan's documents. At the bottom, there was one more. A sticker with a ladybug didn't scream anything until she flipped it open, 'YuXuang', she read, 'Why the hell does she-'CLICKThe sudden noise confused her and her hands swiped up a penknife immediately, 'Woah  tiger', YuXuan calmed her by raising his handsHer posture dropped slightly but that didn't make her flinch, 'How did you get in here?''I was let in', he answered, 'Lan Fen and Liya let me in''So why are you up here?'He chuckled, a glint sparkling in his eye. 'I want that'She looked down at the folder she held, 'What?''I want my folder', he expressed, 'Please''No this is police evidence', she quickly argued making him smile'Look, I'm not trying to interfere with your work but..I just want my file back''Why?'He locked the door and rolled up his checkered jacket before sitting in a chair next to him, 'Imagine somebody you barely knew had information on you. Your schedule, what banks you use and so much more, what do you think they could do to you?'Kaili leaned agaisn't the desk in thought letting him continue, 'So you see, when I was going through some things with my lawyer yesterday involving my brother's assets, I discovered that another firm had documents relating to the house''I did some digging and turns out, it was Lan Fen's firm. I met up with her yesterday and told her and she confessed she had more files. I came here to find them and take them back''You can't steal from your lawyer!', she rebutted, 'That's going to land you in alot of legal trouble'His lips pursed and he sighed, 'I can't sleep at night knowing that my dead brother's ex has my information along with documents that could potentially control our assets and life''Then I guess you'll need to find a better lawyer to deal with that', she finished, turning to grab the other two documents, 'I'll take this for now but-'Suddenly, a sharp blow to her head made her shudder forward into the painful edge of the desk. She glanced just to see YuXuan approaching her fast like a lumbering bear, grabbing her wrist and slamming her cheek agaisn't the cool wooden surface. 'Sorry tiger', he apologized, avoiding her sharp nails from piercing him, 'I can't let her keep these, you PI people should be the first to know that her taking these documents is wrong'She felt the folders slip out of her fingers for a brief moment before mustering the strength to kick him in the knee with her chunky heel. He staggered back in pain and the files were swept onto the ground creating a slippery mess. Without hesitation, she balled up her fist and pushed herself back into the ring to box him in the cheek, attempting to finish him with a swift roundhouse kick. However YuXuan simply wiped the blood seeping out of his nose and ducked, grabbing her ankle and pulling her body down, colliding it harshly on top of a few plastic boxes that made her yelp and ache. 'Not today', he coughed out, scooping up the files right as the rumble of footsteps could be heardHer hazy eyes watered while her ears were plagued with muffled unrecognizable sounds, it made her violently choke and the tears filled her eyes watered down the throbbing pain she felt. 'I need...a minute', she breathed aloud, closing her eyes to rest her aching body"}

I laugh and said\"we need to stop running into each other like this. people will talk.\" Sammy said\"so we work together and we should be friends right.\" I said\"yea but some one think you might be trying to sneak into my bed or my daughters bed.\" Sammy said\"oh god no I mean your very beautiful Journey don't get me wrong and River is very beautiful as well but I'm not trying to bed you or your daughter. its true that I love you too and your whole family but that is because we're Jr motorsports family.

It wasn't mono. So that's good.\"\"Is he coming here, or are you going there?\" I asked as I started rooting through the fridge. Harry and I were hitting the river, and would need some sustenance to get us through. \"Neither,\" Bells said. \"He's going out with some other friends.\"Weird. Bella and Jake were thick as thieves up until a week ago, when the kids all got sick. Maybe something happened between her and Mike? Maybe Jake still wasn't feeling right? \"Isn't it a little early for lunch?\" She asked, breaking me from my thought. \"No, I'm just packing something to take out to the river...\"\"Oh, fishing today?\"\"Well, Harry called... and it's not raining.\" I realized that this might be one of those rare occasions that Bells might actually want to spend a sunny weekend day with her old man. We still hadn't had one of those together since she showed up to Forks last January.  \"Say, did you want me to stay with you, since Jake's out?\"\"That's okay, Dad. The fish bite better when the weather's nice.\"Well, that was true, but I was sure Harry would understand if I told him something came up. Perhaps we could go get some ice cream cones like we used to, and I could show her the spots that Renee and I used to go. \"Seriously, Dad. I think I'll call Jessica,\" she said. \"We have a Calculus test to study for. I could use her help.\" Well, school should come first. \"That's a good idea,\" I conceded. \"You've been spending so much time with Jacob, your other friends are going to think you've forgotten them.\"She smiled at me and nodded. Only then did I remember what had come of Tuesday's foray into the woods. \"Hey, you'll study here or at Jess's, right?\"\"Sure, where else?\"\"Well, it's just that I want you to be careful to stay out of the woods, like I told you before.\"\"More bear trouble?\" She asked. Charlie nodded, frowning. \"We've got a missing hiker—we found his camp, but no sign of him. There were some really big animal prints... of course those could have come later, smelling the food... Anyway, they're setting traps for it now.\"\"Oh,\" was all she said, but she gave me an affirmative nod so I took that as \"understood.\" I didn't know what reasons Bells would have for wandering around in the woods in the first place—her story of \"hiking\" smelt suspiciously of bologna—but I trusted she had the smarts not to go venturing out, given all that was going on. —\"You know, Charlie, we should probably make this an every weekend kind of thing, don't you think?\" Harry asked as we hypnotically cast our lines out, and in, out, and in. The sun was actually shining down through a rare, blue sky, and though the March air still had the bite of winter to it, spring's eventuality had turned it to more of a nibble. \"Well, if only the sun would join us every weekend,\" I countered. \"But you're right Harry, it would be nice, sunshine or not.\" We stood beside one another for a few minutes in the kind of comfortable silence you can only ever really achieve with family, or friends that you've known so long that they feel like family, before Harry's voice took on a more serious tone. \"Look, Charlie, I know that you went out with the rangers earlier this week,\" Harry said. He had stopped casting his line out, so I did the same. \"And I know why you didn't invite me out, like you normally would for something like that. I want you to know that I'm alright.\" \"Well Harry, I know with your condition and a-\"\"I'm alright! Hell, I even think a nice walk in the woods would do wonders for my health, anyway. Get back to nature, like we're doing now. I'm just saying, you don't have to coddle me, especially when I could actually help. Hate to think of you white boys out getting lost in these woods, hey?\" I mulled it over. The recon we'd done on Tuesday really wasn't too strenuous of a hike, and maybe Harry was right—maybe getting out into nature would be best for him.\"Okay Harry, you win. I'll bring you out on the next one—if you promise me that you'll take it easy and rest any time you might be feeling out of breath, or your heart starts beating a little too hard, or anything of the sort, alright?\" \"Don't you worry. I've made it this far, I'm sure I've got a long road ahead of me yet.\" I couldn't help but feel optimistic about Harry's change in mentality, especially given that the last time we'd spoken, here at this very spot, he'd morbidly told me to look after Sue if he should go. Maybe he was feeling better after getting the testing done. Maybe the trips to the river were doing well for him. Maybe he was just eating a bit healthier at home, with Sue keeping him to a strict diet of fish and vegetables. He did look a bit better, as the sunlight shone down on his salt and pepper hair, and he flashed me one of his winning smiles. \"I'm sure ya do too, Harry. I'm sure ya do too.\" —Bells came home a little later than I'd expected, barging in the door with the look of death on her pale face. \"Where have you been?\" I asked. \"I was hiking,\" she admitted. My mind raced back to the conversation we'd had just that morning, when I'd specifically asked her to stay out of the woods. \"What happened to going to Jessica's?\" \"I didn't feel like Calculus today.\"\"I thought I asked you to stay out of the forest.\"\"Yeah, I know. Don't worry, I won't do it again,\" she said, as though that was all the explanation that was needed. I took a look at her for any more mysterious injuries, but other than a small twig caught in her hair and a bit of glass on her pants, there were no signs of a tumble. \"What happened?\" I asked, trying to keep as level-headed as possible. \"I saw the bear,\" she admitted. \"It's not a bear, though—it's some kind of wolf. And there are five of them. A big black one, and gray, and reddish-brown...\"Exactly what I was worried would happen. Bella didn't know the first thing about wilderness safety, no matter how many times I tried to teach her as a kid. I went over and hugged her, realizing that as terrified as I was for her, she was probably even more shaken up. \"Are you okay?\" I asked as gently as I could. Her head bobbed in a weak nod.\"Tell me what happened.\"\"They didn't pay any attention to me. But after they were gone, I ran away and I fell down a lot.\"My poor daughter, running away from monstrous beasts in the forest. I remember how I'd told Renee, when she was first weighing the pros and cons of Bella moving here, that the forests around Forks were safe as could be. I believed it at the time, at least. \"Wolves,\" I murmured. \"What?\"\"We knew they were wrong tracks for bears—but wolves just don't get that big...\"\"These were huge,\" she said. \"How many did you say you saw?\"\"Five.\"Five huge wolves. A pack of beasts prowling around the woods, attacking hikers, nearly killing my own daughter. \"No. More. Hiking.\" I said, as intensely as possible. \"No problem,\" she promised, and I believed her. I made sure that Bells was feeling alright, sitting her down on the couch with a cuppa tea while I called the station to report what she'd seen. It was troubling that the wolves had come so close to town, given that we'd found the hiker's camp so far out. Something would definitely have to be done. And soon. \"Are you hungry?\" I asked Bells when I hung up the phone.\"Just tired,\" she said, shaking her head and heading up the stairs. It was then that I remembered that I'd seen Jake earlier that day. \"Hey, didn't you say Jacob was gone for the day?\"\"That's what Billy said.\"\"Huh.\"\"Why?\" she asked. I weighed whether or not to tell her, but she'd just been truthful with me, so I figured I'd return the courtesy. \"Well, it's just that when I went to pick up Harry, I saw Jacob out in front of the store down there with some of his friends. I waved hi, but he... well, I guess I don't know if he saw me. I think maybe he was arguing with his friends. He looked strange, like he was upset about something. And... different. It's like you can watch that kid growing! He gets bigger every time I see him.\"\"Billy said Jake and his friends were going up to Port Angeles to see some movies. They were probably just waiting for someone to meet them.\"\"Oh.\" I nodded and ducked out to the kitchen. Bells headed upstairs. As honest as I was trying to be with her, I couldn't bear to tell her that it didn't look at all like those boys had plans to go to the movies. ---There's a new chapter lined up for every Friday at noon!

Not terrible. :) We(Me, Calvin, Gray) went to Walgreens and got some milk, water bottles, triple fudge brownie ice cream and I got myself some beef jerky. The beef jerky is usually $7 but was on sale with walgreen rewards for $3.99. Absolutely delicious! Calvin made him and I delicious milkshakes to sip on while we watch Brooklyn 99 and fold laundry. We vacuumed with our new vacuum and the rugs and carpets look nice. I need to clean Graysons room. Hopefully I will do it soon. My phone got super weird but it's better now. I started using fetch again which is good because I love that app but I suck at commitments. I watched A LOT of Brooklyn 99 lol and then I took a nap. I woke up very sweaty though and crabby but then I took a nice shower while blasting Taylor swift with the new shower speaker my mom got Calvin for Christmas. I apologized to two of my very old friends but no response. I miss them. I joined some sibling loss grief groups yesterday and it's nice to see I'm not alone. My heart aches for everyone but I'm hoping being in some communities full of people who understand will help heal me. I decided I want to start shitposting again and maybe upkeep a public image. I had a large public image for awhile until my brother passed and I just stopped. My lymph node has been bothering me on my left side but I'm hoping it's better soon. I also have a killer canker sore ): I'm nervous about Calvin going back to work tomorrow and then Grayson going back to school Thursday. I've loved living in my little bubble of just us. Calvin also has to get his car inspected tomorrow so it'll be legal again! Whoop whoop. I need to make it a priority to CLEAN soon. I'm a little sick but feeling better today than I did yesterday. It's some viral infection I know that for sure. I also want to start meal planning. And I'm debating big time whether or not I should quit my job. Okay, goodnight. Until tomorrow 💗"}

The woman Annette placed a hand on Myra's shoulder, and Myra resisted the urge to shrug it off. She did not like Annette. There was something wrong about her, something in the way she looked at Myra, as if she were holding an unripe fruit in her mouth that she didn't want her to see. Across from the cart on which Mama's body lay stood Uncle Errol, his brow furrowed as he chewed on his nail. When Myra looked at him, he averted his gaze. Did Uncle Errol dislike her? Why? But that only added to the mystery she had yet to solve. She had heard the others talking. They did not know she was the daughter of Princess Olivia until the wedding. But why was Uncle Gavin there if he did not know? Why was he waiting to take her away? He had been surprised to learn that Mama was still alive, so that could not have been the reason. And now what did that mean for her? If you're scared of someone and can't get them to go away, Mama had said, get them to like you. Then they'll be less likely to hurt you. She had said this of Mr. Skaggs and also of Father. Mama never once yelled at Mr. Skaggs or said a mean thing about him, even though he snored and had kidnapped her from her home. And, if Mama had a warning that Father was coming, she would make him a big pot of stew made from vegetables Myra plucked out of the garden. She'd then set the table nice and have Myra fetch fresh flowers too. When Father got there, Mama would send Myra to go hide and not come back until morning. No need to bother him, she'd say. But sometimes, Father would bring friends over too, and while she might be able to get away from Father while he was distracted by Mama, the friends were harder to make go away. So, she'd learned to be nice to them too. Myra continued to catch Uncle Errol staring at her. What was going on behind those eyes? She had yet to speak to him, so why did he hate her already? Was it because of Father? Because she hated Father too. Father had hurt Mama many times before, and today? Well, Mama lay dead now because of him. Of all the people in the courtyard, Uncle Errol scared Myra the most. Everyone listened to him, just as everyone listened to Father. At his order, the servants wrapped Mama in white blankets and bound them with cords. After this, he instructed them to deliver Mama to the King in Waterford. Myra hoped they would bury her on a hillside underneath the stars. Mama liked the stars. A daisy peeked out between the flagstones of the courtyard. If she could not have the stars, then at least she could have her favorite flower. Myra plucked it and moved back to the wagon, but a servant blocked her way. \"No, child,\" he said. \"Leave her be.\" But Uncle Gavin scooped Myra up and set her on his hip. He moved unhindered to the head of the wagon, placed her on the edge of the wooden slats, and nodded at Mama. Myra slipped the stem of the daisy into the bindings and then planted a kiss on her covered cheek. When she raised back up, Uncle Errol was scowling at her again, as were several of the others around her. What had she done to make them all hate her so much? Maybe getting Uncle Errol to like her would be more than Myra could do. But Uncle Gavin was the only one who looked untroubled when he set her back down on the cobbles. Although he did look very sad. \"Send this to my father.\" Uncle Gavin handed a sealed envelope to the driver of the cart. The driver, a man wearing a blue jacket, nodded, tucked the letter into his jerkin, and flicked the reins of the horses. The cart went forward with a lurch and Mama rolled away. Once the wagon disappeared, no one seemed to pay Myra much mind as they went about their usual business. Having nothing else to do, Myra went about finding more of the resilient daisies popping up in the cracks of the flagstones. Soon, she had several strung together in a chain, but she needed more to do what she had in mind. As she rounded a corner to find more, she was surprised when Uncle Gavin came too, strolling behind, hands in his pockets. He was following her, Myra realized with a start. But why? Father's friends had sometimes followed her about too. They pretended that they weren't, but why else would they be so far from the house? Most of them were working up the nerve to ask her a question. Everyone got around to it eventually. Myra wandered through the halls of the fortress, taking in the rough-hewn stonework. The place was amazing. Never before had she seen walls made entirely of stones. A few servants passed now and then, but fewer people were gathered here than in the courtyard. When she looked over her shoulder, sure enough, Uncle Gavin was following her, but he smiled at her ever so softly. \"I'm not trying to make you nervous, Myra,\" said Uncle Gavin. \"I just don't want you to wander off and get lost.\" \"You're not making me nervous,\" she lied. \"Do you want to walk with me?\" Uncle Gavin shrugged and joined her. His eyes were still red and his shoulders were hunched as if they had weights on them. She offered her hand to him, and, after considering it for a time, he took it. \"You loved my mama,\" said Myra. \"Yes, I did.\" \"Did Uncle Errol love Mama?\" \"With all his heart,\" he said, squeezing her hand. \"If we had known how, we would have done anything to bring her home.\" \"But Uncle Errol doesn't like me very much, does he?\" Uncle Gavin ran his gaze over her and Myra blushed. \"Uncle Errol doesn't know what to think of you,\" he said. \"It's not every day that you find out you have a niece.\" The hall dead-ended at an old wooden door and Uncle Gavin pushed it open as if unafraid of what lay behind it, or whether or not it was against the rules. Tall windows stood from floor to ceiling with various colors of glass casting strange yet beautiful colors on the floor. Myra's mouth hung open as she took in the room, not knowing why such a lovely place had been constructed but thrilled to be present there. She turned circles, trying to take it all in, only to see that the light bounced off little crystals embedded in the stone floor, illuminating buttresses carved into the walls. \"It's an old chapel,\" said Uncle Gavin as he righted an overturned stool. \"Priests used to hold worship here.\" His gaze ran up and down her once more. \"They don't worship the Spirits anymore?\" \"Cumbria follows a different religion now. Well, most do.\" He nodded to a candle upon the floor burned down to a nub. A bench sat against the wall, and Gavin slumped down into it, burying his head into his hands. Myra wished he was not so sad. "}

My father came to see me the next evening with a slow walk so I knew he had already had a talk with Volto.\"Seems like he is interested in you,\" he said sitting in front of the fire while I sat opposite him in the smaller armchair. \"I don't know, father. It was not my intention and...and there is a good reason why I cannot as you know,\" I said watching the flickering flames. He nodded \"I know, his father warned me about his stubbornness but that boy has achieved a lot of things so for his reward for winning the Roaming Battle he had asked for a marriage to a princess of the Central Kingdom. You can see he thinks ahead.\"\"I do not like him,\" I replied simply, making him chuckle \"I know you don't and that is why you haven't eaten much during lunch.\"\"But you don't seem against the idea,\" I watched him frown. \"The forces of the kingdoms are restless these days. I have heard rumors Volto has an army of his own.\"\"So you are afraid he would make trouble if we fuss. How about telling him I don't have long to live?\"He wrinkled his brow \"I must say he is determined. I already told him but he says he will find a way to make you live and it doesn't matter.\"I closed my eyes covering an internal despair \"I will do as you say father, but there will be only a change in the engagement there is no need to...make certainties.\"He smiled \"I understand my daughter. Don't worry King Frederick Loom would be arriving soon so Volto will have other things to focus.\"                                             -----------------------------------------------------Sir Edgar watched the practicing as he realized the presence of his majesty next to him. He bowed making Herald wave a hand \"Don't mind Edgar, I came here not as a king but to enjoy a good fight with my friend.\"Edgar smiled \"It seems Lisa has brought you some trouble.\"\"It certainly is lively, what do you say Edgar, should I forget about worrying and just reject Volto or should I do as she says?\"\"You know you have already decided. Volto made a mistake he shouldn't have told you.\" Herald laughed loudly while Edgar remained silent \"Now I know why Lisa treats you like her Uncle. Both of you know me the best.\"\"Herald,\" said Edgar clapping the back of his friend \"We are old now. There is a newer world ahead. A newer Zerald.\"Herald nodded \"Yes, we cannot compromise now. Defenses must not be taken as Offences just for trifles.\"The two men stood watching the two sparring men. Both were equally matched but only one would win and it proved to be true in who gained the quicker stance wisely avoiding an aggressive attack from his opponent. His attack was a passive one but it was enough to tire out his opponent who gave up faster easily gaining him to be the winner for both the spectators who were rooting for him.                                                            ***************I gazed at the mirror at the unfamiliar figure looking back at me. The embroidered dress of gold felt heavy as I tried to straighten my back in a vain attempt to gain some confidence but my shoulders drooped again while the maids around me fussed in arranging the small silver tiara on my head. Helena came into the room and I ordered the maids to leave. \"I didn't expect you to come. I don't even know what to say.\"She held her head high \"Father told me the details. There is nothing that can be done anyway. I just came here because he wanted me to, not because I wanted to hear any excuses.\"I smiled \"Then I won't explain anything since you don't want to hear anyway. But I need to trouble you to send a message to Sir Edgar tell him to refuse the envoys from red city.\"\"What makes you think I will do that?\"\"Because you are the future Queen and you should want to protect the kingdom. You have formed your own opinion of Red city have you not?\" I provoked her as she glared and left the room. I sat down alone on my bed waiting for the summons to enter the engagement ceremony. The door opened and a maid entered carrying a tray of tea. I had ordered it myself but from the first sip I sensed the unusual taste but I could not voice my thoughts as I got dizzy.\"Damien,\" I called his name seeing him sitting in front of me. He reached a hand and held my hand in his as I regained some strength. \"There are many enemies,\" he said without looking at me. His gaze was on my hand as he continued \"Don't trust anyone.\"He was about to withdraw his hand but suddenly stopped and frowned as I traced his glare to the spellbound ring on my finger.\"Why do you have that?\" he asked as I replied \"Volto put it on me to track me. I just don't know how to remove it.\"Those silver eyes were gleaming fiercely but with an effort he controlled his emotions and took my hand towards him. Slowly he pulled out the ring and I could hear the faint tune of a spell. I smiled and thanked him only to get a silent response as he soon turned his back towards me.\"Why are you angry?\" I asked him but he just left the cave. I stood up wanting to follow but realized I would never match his speed and the path outside felt hazy for me to see clearly. It was warm inside the cave and I saw that apart from the bed there was a cupboard and a small table. I wondered how he lived so desolately making me realize I should be glad I at least had Hyacinth's company in the tower. He came back in the evening as the candles in the cave lit by themselves. Putting down the knapsack he gave a cursory glance at me \"Here's some food.\"This time before he could leave I held onto his cloak \"What about you? Are you not going to eat?\"\"I don't need food.\" His coldness was irritating me so I asked directly \"Why are you angry?\" I asked again and then something dawned on my mind \"Are you upset because Volto gave me a ring?\"The way he looked away made me smile as I couldn't help teasing him \"So that time when he was injured you were the force that pulled my hand away right?\"\"Think what you want,\" he gave a distant stare \"But you should get some energy to get back soon. Everyone must be waiting for you.\"\"I am not in a hurry to go,\" I said sitting back on the chair \"I don't want the engagement anyway. I guess I should thank my enemies.\"He turned towards me slightly \"Are you sure, you don't want to go yet?\"\"Yes, I should be with the person whom I missed the most. I will not blame you for breaking the promise,\" I almost pleaded him, hoping he would look at me once. Fragments of my memory had resurfaced as I kept thinking of his name and I knew why I wanted to be with him. But his recent coldness was frustrating as I couldn't clearly identify the reason.Those silver handsome eyes looked directly to mine as if to confirm my words. \"You-you remember?\"\"Are you mad that I forgot?\" I asked him again but this time he came near \"Lisa, I am not the Damien you used to know. I am an apprentice of the Power Lenders now, so you should go back to your home.\"\"Liar,\" I said trying to curb the tears \"You wouldn't have brought me here if you didn't care anymore. Do you really want me to go back soon?\"His eyes glistened while he clenched his teeth. Then abruptly he lifted me up and placed me on top of the bed.\"You should rest. Don't worry if you don't want to go yet. You can stay for a while but...don't wander out alone and don't talk with others.\"\"There are others here?\"\"Keep your promise,\" he laid a hand on my head and I felt my eyelids drooping. When I woke up the next morning, the sun brightly entered the cave and I saw the breakfast prepared on the table"}

He had tossed and turned all night, plagued by fatigue and the weight of his responsibilities. As the first light of daybreak illuminated his modest bedroom, he couldn't shake the weariness that clung to him like a persistent shadow.The night before had been gruelling. Ashok, a diligent cab driver navigating the bustling streets of Gurgaon, had just finished another exhausting shift. His days were a relentless cycle of driving for multiple companies and shuttling passengers across different routes. But this night, in particular, had been more demanding than usual.The reason behind his added exhaustion was the upcoming marriage of his niece, a girl he cherished like his own daughter. The responsibilities of arranging and managing the festivities weighed heavily on him. Ashok had spent the last week juggling his demanding work schedule with the intricate details of the wedding preparations.With a sigh, Ashok got out of bed, his body aching from the physical strain and lack of sleep. His mind replayed the events of the previous night — the extra hours added to his shift, the journey to the railway station to pick up relatives from distant Haryana villages. It had been a relentless marathon, leaving him with only a few hours of restless sleep each night.Dragging himself out of his fatigue-induced stupor, Ashok decided to take his German Shepherd, Alex, for a walk. The loyal dog, with its sleek and well-maintained coat, was a source of solace for Ashok. Together, they embarked on a morning stroll, the fresh air doing little to dispel the weariness that clung to Ashok's bones.As they walked, Ashok's mind drifted to the previous night's drive. The Bollywood tunes playing in his cab had failed to uplift his spirits. The monotony of the familiar MG Road had lulled him into a drowsy state. The exhaustion took its toll, causing his eyelids to droop and his reflexes to slow.It was during this haze of weariness that Ashok experienced a jolt — a sudden, unexpected speed bump that sent a shiver through his spine. His eyes snapped open, and he heard a faint squeal, like a distant cry. Panic surged, but he hesitated to look in the rearview mirror or bring the cab to a stop.The reality of the situation hit him when he reached home. Blood smeared the front bumper of his cab, a grim reminder of the mysterious incident on MG Road. In a moment of instinctive action, Ashok grabbed a wet cloth and scrubbed away the evidence. The impact had left a slight dent, a subtle misalignment, but Ashok was determined to erase any visible traces of the night's events.As he stared at his cab in the daylight, the absence of any visible signs of an accident perplexed him. Had it been a figment of his exhausted imagination, or had something truly ominous occurred on MG Road? The questions lingered, casting shadows on the edges of his consciousness.The following morning, as the sun began to rise, Ashok took a moment to assess the situation in the harsh light of day. The car displayed no major signs of a collision. Doubt gnawed at him, but he pushed it aside, telling himself it was just a weary mind playing tricks.With a heavy heart, Ashok returned home, determined to resume his routine. The day unfolded, and he found himself preparing for his first pickup and drop — Captain Verma, a pilot from a renowned airline company. The mundane activities of daily life masked the mystery that lingered from the night before, a puzzle waiting to be unraveled.Little did Ashok know that the shadows cast on MG Road would follow him, weaving their tendrils into the fabric of his ordinary existence, setting the stage for an unforeseen journey into the unknown.----------------------------------------------------The next morning, as Ashok maneuvered through the chaotic streets of Gurgaon on his way to pick up Captain Verma, a cloud of worry clung to him like a persistent shadow. The events of the previous night replayed in his mind like a broken record, each thought gnawing at his conscience. Why had he closed his eyes? What if someone had witnessed the peculiar incident on MG Road?As he pulled up to Captain Verma's house, his mind was a whirlwind of unanswered questions. The captain hopped into the cab, exchanging pleasantries with Ashok. However, as soon as the seasoned pilot settled into the passenger seat, his keen eyes noticed the slight misalignment of the cab's bumper.Curiosity gleamed in Captain Verma's eyes as he pointed to the bumper and asked, \"What happened here, Ashok? Looks like your bumper took a hit.\"Caught off guard, Ashok quickly conjured a lie, claiming that an unruly auto had collided with him. The captain chuckled, expressing his disdain for the reckless driving habits of auto rickshaw drivers, and soon shifted his attention to his phone. Ashok breathed a sigh of relief; his feeble attempt at deception had passed without further scrutiny.As they approached the same intersection where the mysterious incident occurred, the traffic signal glowed red. On the opposite side, Ashok spotted a flurry of activity — policemen securing the area, scrutinizing the surroundings for clues. Anxiety crept over him like a shadow, and the captain, noticing Ashok's unease, nonchalantly remarked, \"Looks like there's been an accident.\"With a subtle nod, Ashok acknowledged the captain's observation, desperate to avoid any discussion on the matter. Captain Verma, sensing something amiss, continued scrolling through his phone, leaving Ashok to grapple with the weight of his secret.After dropping the captain at the airport, Ashok wasted no time. The burden of guilt and fear weighed heavily on him, making it nearly impossible to focus on his work. The constant dread of potential consequences gnawed at his conscience. He decided that he couldn't continue in this manner, living in perpetual fear of being caught or interrogated.On his way to the next corporate pick-up, Ashok made a bold decision. He reached out to his daily route vendors and requested an additional week's leave, extending beyond the upcoming week dedicated to his niece's wedding. Given Ashok's reputation for honesty and reliability, the vendor didn't hesitate, granting his request without probing further.With the leaves approved, Ashok completed the remaining pick-ups and drops diligently, ensuring he fulfilled his commitments to the vendor. Every interaction was marked by an undercurrent of anxiety, but he persevered until the last drop-off. Rushing home, he took Alex, his loyal German Shepherd, for a brisk night walk, contemplating his next move.As he entered his house, Ashok found the courage to broach the subject with Geeta. Surprised by his sudden decision, she recognized the exhaustion etched on his face and the strain in his voice. With a mixture of concern and understanding, she agreed to his plan, only asking him to return before his niece's wedding ceremony.With thirty thousand rupees in cash, a bag of clothes, and Alex by his side, Ashok embarked on an impromptu journey to Rishikesh. The city's spiritual tranquility beckoned to him, offering refuge from the turmoil that had taken residence in his mind. The hum of the engine drowned out the cacophony of doubts that had plagued him on his way back to home from Gurgaon.The road to Rishikesh stretched before him like a promise of solace, a chance to escape the shadows that clung to him in the bustling city. As he left his humble abode in South Delhi  behind, Ashok couldn't help but wonder if the serene landscapes of Rishikesh held the key to unraveling the mystery that had unfolded on that fateful night on MG Road.-----------------------------------------------"}

Inside the floors are sleek marble white and the walls are covered in glittering paintings most of them are Chris in various poses. Chris gives us a little tour of the hotel the Spa and the gaming room were popular destinations They're was even a little swimming pool in the back yard along with shiny new furniture. For dinner we had the some nice food and a even serves us some wine. I wonder how this show could afford all this ? Probably super sketchy but I don't really care we still have to share rooms but after spending years on crappy reality shows I know this is really the best it would get. I hear Lighting humming in the bathroom. \" How's the greatest?\" He says to himself in the mirror smiling smugly \" Sha Lighting is!\" He spits out his toothpaste. I roll my eyes I have a kindergartener on my team hurray. Speaking of sKindergarteners I see Cody eating a bunch of Candy and Soada like he didn't have enough from before. I can't see Ducan or DJ right now  so  I figured they must be in downstairs. \" Hi Noah\" Cody says his voice muffled from chewing\" Hey\" I say turning on the lamp to see better \" New season huh?\" He says kind of distantly his brown eyes look more than a little distracted \" Who do you think will win\" he asks \" Me obviously\" I say sarcastically but he starts laughing I laugh a little too.\" I don't know maybe Courtney will finally get her long lusted for win\" I replied opening my book \" What about the Newbies\" he ask a little nervously. I look at him why would he be nervous?\" Do you have a crush on the new girl or something\" I ask him this wouldn't be the first time he had a crush on somebody. Plus that Jenny girl is definitely prettier than Gwen. She seems nice enough very athletic and an obvious overachiever hopefully she doesn't turn out to be a another Courtney. I do have admit she picked a really Werid team does was that stragteic or just a random choice?\" What No I don't even no the girl plus she looks like she would have a boyfriend back home right?\" He says \" Plus I don't want to fall for someone who's likes someone else you know\" He gets up to throw his garbage \" How's your girlfriend doing Emma?\" I internally groan So far Zoe, Betsy and Sierra and even Lindsay asked me about Emma. The thing was it was really just an in game  fling she was nice she was always talking about her ex boyfriend \" Oh Mike or whatever his generic name was used to talk to the library\" or it was \" Mike always remembered my drink\"So after she headed back to law school we said we would take a break but we both know it was a breakup.\" We kind of broke up\" I say \" Oh Sorry man that sucks\"he says \" At least I don't have a stalker following me around\" I say\" Sierra!\" He flinched \" Did you see her anywhere?\" He almost looks terrified. Tragic Heather appears in the room \" Why are you guys taking about Sierra. That girl is a serious creep maybe Stupid Courtney should get her layer and get a restraining order against her\" she says \" Umm why are you here? This isn't the girls room unless you count Cody as a girl?\" I hear him say Hey \" Well I was looking for Something but that's none of your business bye geeks\" She leaves the room slamming the door behind her Lightning still isn't out of the bathroom yet. \" Heather always the dainty little princess\" I say \" More like a Dirty little demon\" Cody mutters his eyelid's dropping I close the lamp as Cody falls asleep and go out of the room trying to find something to do? It's Werid that why have no lights out obviously we are all adults now but most of these guys are like children they'll eat to much and fall asleep like Somebody or they will be awake all night. I go to the Den area and scan through they're book selection \" Hi Noah\" I hear a voice say it's probably a girl I turn  around expecting to see Zoey but I turn and see Jenny staring me down \"Hi Jenny\" I say in a monotone tone\" You like books?\" I ask her she nods looking at the floor I hand her a copy of what looks to be a decent thriller novel \" You are smart Didnt you work at computer company when you where six?\"she asked it will always Werid my out by how much random strangers know about me Guess this is the Celebrity life is \" Please don't tell me your another super fan\" I ask her She stops looks at me than suddenly laughs out loud I'm a real comedian today. Now Jenny being real shady she has no real reason to talk to me she either wants something or knows something \"Cut to the chase what do you want?. She gets up and beacons for me to follow her we move down to the Kicthen.\" Well since you wanted me to cut to the chase I want to have an alliance\" she says bluntly her hazel eyes look very unamused \"why would I make an alliance with you?\" I say\" Well your not very athletic or charismatic you say a lot of snarky things to people it's only a matter of time before you get eliminated\" she says all of this very very professionally \" Well that's rude aren't you supposed to sugar coat your true intentions a little\" I say frankly the things Jenny said are all very true and don't really bother me what bothers me is how she said it tracing away from the subject, no sugar coating , it makes me suspicious but I don't show it \" You would probably see right through me If you ally yourself with me I will take you to the top and split the prize money\" she says \" Even if you did have the skills to do that how do I know you wouldn't just lie and run with the money\" I ask No one every wants to share things especially large sums of cash.\"You don't alliances are built on trust if you don't have any trust in an alliance you have no alliance\" she says \" Well I guess that's true fine I'll bite\" I put me hand out for her to shake she does handshake is very light I heard something about something about handshakes before I can't put my finger on it thought. \" It's a deal\" she says smiling softly.Her face is barley visible in the slow light but I can see how shiny her teeth are.I still don't trust her at all . I smile back hoping the slow lights can hide my deceit."}

My name is Florence Moreno, and at 17, I found myself standing at the crossroads of a life-altering decision. My family consisted of my lively 25-year-old brother, Alexander, our stay-at-home mom, and our dad, a businessman whose work often took him on journeys to New York. The constant back-and-forth was wearing on my mother, and one day, she proposed a monumental change – a permanent move to New York City. There was one condition, though, that would make this transition bearable for me: my own bakery.⋆ ˚｡⋆୨୧˚⋆｡˚ ⋆ My gaze lingered on the English landscape outside my bedroom window, a familiar scene that seemed to whisper both goodbye and promise. Seventeen years of memories, friendships, and the comforting embrace of my childhood home now stood on the precipice of change. My older brother, Alexander, burst into the room, his excitement contagious.   \"Flo, can you believe it? New York awaits us!\" His grin mirrored the thrill that danced in his eyes. I sighed, a mix of apprehension and nostalgia flooding my senses. \"I know, Alex. It's just... it's hard to leave everything behind. Friends, memories, the life we've known.\" He wrapped an arm around my shoulders, a comforting gesture from my tall and optimistic brother. \"Change is scary, but trust me, the adventure that awaits us in New York will be worth it. Plus, we'll have the whole family together.\" Our mother, a steadfast presence in the doorway, joined the conversation. \"Florence, darling, I know this is challenging for you. But your father's job in New York is a golden opportunity. And Alexander is thrilled to explore the city.\" I nodded, understanding the logic behind the move. My father, a businessman, often traveled to New York to collaborate with the Suttons, a family renowned in the business world. The idea of leaving my life behind in England, especially my best friend, Aurelia, tugged at my heart. After sharing the news with Aurelia, we found ourselves on the swing in my backyard, laughter echoing through the crisp English air. Affectionately known as Pinkie for her love of the color pink, Aurelia listened as I poured out my worries. \"Pinkie, I can't imagine life without you. What if we drift apart?\" I confessed, my eyes reflecting the fear of losing a lifelong friend. Aurelia squeezed my hand. \"Flo, true friends withstand any distance. Besides, I've already convinced my parents to let me move with you. We're in this together.\" Wide-eyed, I stared at her in disbelief. \"Pinkie, you'd really do that for me?\" She grinned. \"Of course! What are best friends for? New York is going to be amazing, and we'll create unforgettable memories together.\" Relief washed over me, knowing that my partner in crime would be by my side in the bustling streets of New York.As we packed our belongings, I couldn't help but reflect on the unexpected turns life had taken. The journey ahead promised new beginnings and challenges, but the support of my family and Pinkie made it bearable.While grateful for Aurelia's decision to join us, a bittersweet feeling lingered. The nightfall found me sitting on my bedroom floor, surrounded by half-packed suitcases, holding a photograph of Aurelia and me from our kindergarten graduation.\"Goodbye, England. Tomorrow, a new chapter begins in the city that never sleeps,\" I whispered to the stars that adorned the night sky. ⋆ ˚｡⋆୨୧˚⋆｡˚ ⋆Meanwhile, in the heart of New York City lived Xavier, a professional racer whose life echoed the city's dynamic pulse. His world was further enriched by Rose, his sassy 3-year-old daughter, and Miles, a longtime friend who became family. Their lives were woven together by a shared history, a connection forged in the bustling city that never slept. Rose's infectious laughter filled the Upper East Side home they shared, creating a haven of warmth amidst the city's concrete embrace. Xavier's decision to prioritize his daughter over his dreams of university spoke volumes about the sacrifices and joys of single parenthood. Miles, having faced the harsh realities of foster care, found solace and belonging in Xavier's family. Their bond transcended blood, a testament to the power of chosen families in a city teeming with endless possibilities.⋆ ˚｡⋆୨୧˚⋆｡˚ ⋆ As dawn broke, the Moreno family embarked on their journey to New York. The airplane soared through the clouds, leaving behind the familiar English landscapes for the towering skyscrapers and bustling streets of a city waiting to embrace us. Caught between the past and an uncertain future, I clutched the photograph, finding solace in the promise of a new adventure. The plane touched down at John F. Kennedy International Airport, and as I stepped onto the tarmac, the bustling energy of New York surrounded me. Tall buildings reached for the sky, and the sounds of honking cars and distant chatter filled the air. It was a stark contrast to the tranquility of England, but the vibrant chaos of the city was a promise of the unknown. Settling into our new apartment in the heart of Manhattan, my room overlooked the cityscape, a far cry from the rolling hills of England. As I unpacked, a mix of excitement and trepidation settled in. The city held countless possibilities, but it also meant leaving behind the familiar. True to her word, Aurelia had successfully convinced her parents to let her move to New York. Our reunion in the bustling streets echoed with laughter, a testament to the enduring bond of friendship. The first chapter of our New York adventure was about to unfold, and little did I know, the city held surprises that would change our lives forever. authors note hey gorgeous people! alright soo this is the first chapter of new york lovers, i hope you guys have enjoined reading this and thank you for wanting to read this.bit of a short chapter but i'll do my best to get longer chapters out soon.let me know what you guys thought of this chapter and i hope all of you had a wonderful day today!lots of love shabi ୨୧word count: 1026"}

All I got to do was teach some newbies how to hold a gun, they won't last three minutes on the battlefield if we were to go to war again.I look around my room, my tiny, bland, insignificant room.Plain white walls with a single painting, literally a giant heart with fancy lines around it. In the corner is a small walk-in closet full of clothes. Next to it is a tall rectangular mirror. On the other side of the room is my bed and my work desk, both equally dirty, I'll need to clean them tonight. On my desk is a picture frame, the picture shows me and my sister, Aiko, she's five years younger than me with braided Hazlenut hair, dark cherry red eyes and wearing blue overalls. I haven't seen her in years since I joined the army.On the side of my bed is the door to the bathroom, with the bare necessities, a sink, shower, and toilet.I walk over to the mirror and look at myself for a good minute.I have long brown hair, pale red eyes, and tanned skin, nowhere near pretty.There's also the mark on my cheek that shows where I'm from. I'm from the Hearts so there's a little red heart there. It's impossible to remove it, the most you can do is cover it up with makeup, not that I ever tried, I'm a proud Heart, through and through. There's also faint eyebags under my eyes, showing that I've been missing sleep lately.I head on over to the coffee machine and put a mug under the nozzle.Would you look at that, the legendary war general is actually a coffee addict as well.There's a knock on my door, who would be knocking at ridiculous'o'clock in the night?I rub my eyes a little and walk to the door.I open the door, it's one of the servants for the castle, Hikari.\"Miss Asahi, I have news from the queen.\"She bows and I flinch a little, this bowing stuff makes me feel guilty.\"No need to bow Hikari, and just call me Asahi, what news is it?\"\"Her majesty wishes to discuss the plan for the next attack, she also wishes to send a search party for the missing soldiers but wants to go over it with you, since you are the general and all.\"She stops bowing and seems to relax a little. I smile.\"Alright, could you tell her that I'll be there in a few minutes?\"\"I'll go tell her that right now.\"She starts to bow again but stops when she remembers what I said,\"Oh wait, here, catch Hikari!\"I reach into my sweater pocket and toss her a chocolate bar. Hikari barely manages to catch it and looks at me like I just gave her a winning lottery ticket.\"Someone gave it to me but I'm not a fan of chocolate so you can have it.\"All she does is nods then mumbles a quick,\"Thank you, I'll leave now.\"She leaves my room, half running.\"Alrighty, time to talk with the queen.\"I go to my closet and pick out some decent clothes then stand in front of the mirror to braid my hair, Aiko always said braids look cool on me.I leave the room, completely forgetting about the coffee.Kaede Hotaru\"Bye Kaede! See you tomorrow!\"My friend, Yume waves and runs off.\"You too! Stay safe!\"I smile and wave back, another day of school, done. \"I'm home!\"I open the door and call out,\"Oh! Kaede? I'll be right there!\"After a minute, my mom comes to meet me at the door,\"Welcome home sweetie, did you have a good day?\"She hugs me gently. She has blonde hair, orange eyes and the white diamond symbol on her cheek, just like me.\"Mhm, it was pretty good.\"I reply and hug her back.\"And did anybody find out about your, you know-\"She pauses as she tries to talk about that topic.\"Don't worry mom, nobody even thinks I'm a half-blood, I'm a Diamond, and I will be forever.\"I smile\"That's good to hear, I'm making stew for dinner tonight, you wanna help?\"My mom lets go of me,\"Maybe I can help later? I have a little homework to do first then I'll come help.\"\"Of course, if you're stuck on something, come ask me alright?\"\"I will!\"I kiss my mom on the cheek and run up the stairs into my room. Once I'm in there I take out my laptop and open up my assignment.I'm supposed to write a presentation about the great war.The Clovers were enemies with all other kingdoms, Diamonds were once allied with the Hearts before they left us to ally with the Clovers for their trading ports.That alliance was also broken four years ago when the Hearts attacked the Clovers for no clear reason. Then there was also when the Clover soldier faced the entire army alone to save the kingdom, dying in the process. People in the Clover kingdom think it was nobel and brave but I just find it stupid. Why would you fight an opponent you know you can't beat? It makes no logical sense.Then there was the massive rebellions in the Clovers kingdom because the king and queen did nothing to help that soldier.The Spades were always in hiding, killing off their enemies in secret. Nobody other than the Spades themselves know where their kingdom is and they're experts at disguise. Anyone in the kingdoms could be a Spade in disguise and we wouldn't know, that really scares me actually.Spades were always assassinating the other kingdoms, mostly the Hearts and Diamonds because of how dangerous enemies they are to them.In a real fight, the Spades would be crushed, sure they can kill people while they're alone or asleep but they do that because their weapons and numbers are limited. The dark is the only reason they haven't lost yet.My father was also from the Spades, my mother met him while he was in hiding and fell in love with him. Once they had me, my father disappeared, me and mom think he went back to the Spades but the damage was irreversible, they had created a half-blood, half Diamond and half Spade, an illegal human. If anyone ever found out, they'll chain me up in public and execute me. In the Diamond's kingdom of course, I wouldn't know what they would do to me if I went to another kingdom.What am I thinking, I'm not going to leave this place anyways, I have mom and Yume, that's all I need.More and more thoughts pile up in my head as I think about the war, this project will be a breeze.I swiftly write down some brainstorm ideas and head back down to help make some of mom's delicious stew.Iko Tsuki\"Moon? Get over here you measly human!\"A voice booms from down the hallway.\"Shut the fuck up~\" I mumble, but quickly head towards the sound, needing to keep up the impression of a guard named Moon for the king and queen of Clovers.When I arrive the king glares at me before speaking,\"Moon, how many times must I tell you?! When you're in front of the king, you bow, show your respect!\"I'm going to freaking murder you if you don't shut up.\"Yes sir, my mistake.\"I go on my knees and bow, just like a good guard that is 100% not a spy for the Spades.\"That's better, now go fetch us some tea and treats, we have guests coming over.\"I roll my eyes and stand up, I didn't know that a guard was also the servant.\"Yes sir.\"It's only been a week and I hate this job.As I'm walking to the kitchen I notice a painting on the wall, it shows a boy with white hair and black streaks, boring gray eyes and pale skin, very concenrnigly pale skin. He's wearing the Clover's official uniform, the same as the one I'm wearing right now.As I observe the painting, a voice says behind me,\"That's Yoshimura, he was one of our bravest soldiers, we put this painting up to honour his sacrifice, without the king's consent, but still.\"I jump and whirl around to face the person who talked, hands instinctively reaching to the sword on my hip.It's a girl, one of the servants.\"Sacrifice? What kind?\"I can't help but be slightly interested in this \"Yoshimura\".\"You don't know? A few years ago, when the Hearts attacked, he single-handedly faced their entire forces to let everyone else escape. It worked, everyone had escaped safely, other than Yoshimura himself. The Hearts overpowered him and killed him. It's a sad tale really.\"My eyes widen, the Hearts were known for their armies and weapons, that was basic knowledge, the Diamonds had leverage because of their intelligence, Spades for their resources, and Clovers for their magic users.If what this woman says is true, Yoshimura is truly amazing, even if he died, talk about guts.\"Don't you have somewhere to be now?\"The lady looks at me before walking away herself.\"R-right.\"I run to the kitchen to grab the stupid tea and snacks, thinking of Yoshimura the entire time and what it would be like to have someone like him on this world.Probably not good for me, if I would have to fight Yoshimura or anyone stronger, I'd no doubt be dead.Sure I can poison drinks or assassinate people but my fighting skills are the bare minimum and I know that.Now then, back to work.I take out a small vial from my pocket, it's filled with a poison called Midnight Bloom.Midnight Bloom is a deadly poison that can only be found in the pollen of a certain flower.When this poison touches a living creature, nothing happens, but when it's consumed, it kills the consumer within a few hours, regrowing the deadly flowers inside of their bodies and feeding on the body's nutrients, the healthier you are, the faster you die.Someone like King Furu will die almost immediately, being extremely healthy.Midnight Bloom is the perfect poison for killing someone, you can't tell they're dying until it's too late and it has no scent.I was about to pour the vial into the teapot when I remember, King Furu is having guests today, whoever they might be will also die.I sigh and put the vial away, I'll need to wait until the king alone wants the drink.Disappointed, I take the tray with the treats and non-poisoned tea back to te throne room for my the King.Yoshimura HitoriEverything hurts.It's hard to even think straight without getting a headache.All I can do is lie on the cold rock floor, thirsty, hungry, wounded and tired, not moving a muscle to not hurt myself any further.When I tried to fight the army I assumed the Hearts would just kill me, not bring me back to their base. After all, they weren't known for making wise decisions, yet here I am, stuck in a cell with symbols of Hearts everywhere.I have been in the same room for four years now, I can remember by the amount of times they bring me food. Once every day, water comes once every two days unless I did somethig bad, which I always do.I tilt my head to the exit, grimacing at the pain.I've tried breaking the door down in every way possible when I first arrived here, each time only resulting in me failing and getting a guard to \"punish\" me. Well, they can do anything they want to me, I won't say anything.A shadow passes by the door and I hear a faint lock click, someone's coming in.I close my eyes and act asleep, then I hear the faint whispers as the door opens,\"You sure he won't attack me?\"\"Yes I'm sure, now do you wanna see him or not?\"'Right! Thank you!\"There's footsteps then the cell door closes again, the lock clicking back in place.I keep my breathing slow and even, just a sleeping prisoner here...\"Hey you awake?\"A foot nudges my shoulder, then my hip, right on a wound. I try to stay as still as possible, maybe the person will just leave if they think I'm asleep.\"Wake up Clover, or I'll wake you up myself.\"The person makes \"Clover\" sound like an insult.I hear the foot shuffle and a hand touches my shoulder instead, the person's crouching.\"You look pathetic right now, you know that? Come on, don't make this hard, just stop faking it.\"Any idiot in their right sense of mind knows it's a bluff but I open my eyes anyways, so much for faking sleep.\"That's better! Hiya Clover.\"The person is a woman, in her early twenties probably, she had black hair, emerald green eyes and dark skin, dressed in a simple gray dress and shoes.\"...I-I'm not telling you guys anything. You can go shove a gun in my mouth for all I care.\"I close my eyes again and sigh,\"Well you can tell that to the guards, not me though. I just wanted to meet you.\"I open my eyes.\"Are you n-not a guard?\" I stutter, stupid mouth, I can't even talk normally.I start coughing, and coughing, and coughing again. I quickly try to sit up to get air but everywhere hurts, so much.The woman notices this and looks at me concerned. She puts one of her arms under my back and puts me in a sitting position, her arm being the only thing supporting me.She then opens up a bag on her hip that I hadn't noticed before and hands me a water bottle with a worried expression on her face.I don't think twice before drinking it, it's been ages since I had water.Well, more like four days but I heard people die in a week without water, that's not how I plan on going out.Once the coughing stopped the woman speaks again.\"They really did a number on you didn't they? I don't think I've ever seen anyone in such a terrible state.\"\"D-did you poison the water or something?\"I blurt out, I was so thirsty I had completely forgotten of that possibility.\"Nah, don't worry, you're fine.\"The woman replies, amused.\"Then why would you give me water so willingly? I'm literally a prisoner.\"My stuttering subsides, I can think more clearly thanks to the water.I don't know how to feel about this woman, should I be wary or trust her? She seems friendly enough but I've been here long enough to know that it could be a trick to get me to lower my guard. I can't risk it, the entire Clover kingdom will be in danger if I utter a single word about it.\"Why not? I've never been a fan of these, ahem, cruel methods to gather intel.\"At that, the woman leans me against the cot. She removes the bag and puts it next to me, then stands up and starts to leave the room. But before she does she looks back at me,\"What's your name anyways? You don't need to say your real one if you're worried of me being a spy or something.\"She smiles faintly.\"...er, you can call me Hitori.\"It was the first name that comes to my head.\"Hitori? I must admit, that's, a very lonely name.\"I laugh, \"Hitori\" literally means \"Alone\".The woman laughs as well at her own joke.\"Well, nice to meet you Mr. Lonely, I'm Kagemi, I'll be going now!\"I stare at her in surprise as she leaves, if my memory hasn't failed me, Kagemi is the name of the current princess of Hearts.I cover my mouth,\"Holy lords, I was talking to a princess.\" I mumble.Then I look over at the bag she left for me, curiosity gets the better of me and I painfully grab the bag, setting it on my lap and opening it with interest.Inside was a couple pieces of bread, quickly wrapped up in napkins, I'll assume she smuggled them during her breakfast or something. Then there were two small water bottles, along with the third one she gave to me while I was coughing. I open one and smell it, it doesn't seem poisoned, I can probably trust it. I put the bottles back in the bag and look back aroud it. Under the bread I find three full rolls of bandages and one partially used roll. Next to it is some medicine to prevent wounds from infecting in a little tube. I smile at the stuff she left and start to close the bag when I see a faint glimmer. I squint and try to find what it is. There! In the bag at the very bottom! I reach my hand down and pull out a small dagger, about the size of my hand.On it there's a note,\"Just in case you need it, don't misuse it!\"I look over the dagger again, it's a cool gray with a symbol of a Diamond, she must have gotten it from one of their soldiers in the past. The dagger is small but with all this other stuff in the bag, I can probably escape.I put the dagger under my shirt and put the bag under my mattress of the cot, it's the only hiding place there is.Then I lay back down on the floor and close my eyes, dreaming of how I'll escape from this hell.???\"Did you find it?\"\"...mhm.\"\"Good, your next task is going to be harder. You'll need to go to the Diamonds.\"\"...\"\"There's a girl who lives there, rumours have it that she's a half-blood.\"\"...\"\"I want you to confirm this rumour for me.\"\"Yes sir.\"\"I trust you won't let me down?\"\"Yes sir.\"\"Then you're dismissed.\"\"...\"\"And one more thing.\"\"...\"\"If you do find this girl...\"\"...\"\"Bring her, alive and unharmed. That also means to not scare her, get her to come here by her own will, we need her.\"\"Yes sir, I understand.\"Note:Hello!I'm Akio and this is my ongoing book series! I randomly started to write this from a dream I had and I hope you like this!The next chapter will be focusing more on Asahi and Kaede since I felt like their parts were too short this chapter.I have no exact date for when Chapter 2 will be out but my guess is that it'll be sometime this week or next!I hope you decide to stick around another chapter or two, it means a lot to me!I know that this chapter probably felt very rushed and honestly, I was writing this at 03:34 to 07:23, my brain wasn't being brainy. :/I'll look over Chapter 1 again before publishing the Second one to make sure there were no mistakes but please, if you find any, lemme know, I'll be more than happy to fix them! Same goes for if you have any suggestions!But please do not criticize it, I'm an absolute wimp and I don't handle it very well so please, keep any sort of criticism to yourself.Thank you and have a good day/night!- Akio(Begging that this book doesn't flunk)Last updated: Jan, 3, 2024, 1:07amWord Count: 3324"}

It's been ... a while since we've been here.\" Lucy asked curiously looking up at me.\"Nothing like what you'll picture. It's much more dull.\" I replied bluntly , Telmar really was just a plain place.\"Surely there's something good about it. Narnia had the most fantastic things the trees used to dance.\" Susan suggested optimistically.\"Well the palace gardens are very nice but nothing like dancing trees.\" I said thinking back to the extravagant rows of flowers that Caspian's mother insisted remained in the garden. \"Caspian's mother used to love gardening. Caspian's father kept the gardens the same way she used to plant them. When Caspian's father passed I've kept the gardens looking ... nice , I suppose.\" \"That's lovely\" Susan smiled \"We used to grow vegetables with our mum in the back garden back home\"\"It was so much fun!\" Lucy exclaimed looking up at Susan remembering the memory fondly \"Are you close to your parents Annabelle?\" Lucy asked innocently\"Not really\" I briefly replied not wishing to explain any further \"But I've had Caspian\" I smiled. I can't imagine my father ever joining me in the gardens the activity seemed far too above him, he wouldn't dare dirty himself over some flowers. Mother would just do whatever father said. If he said he didn't want he in the garden then she wouldn't step anywhere near it.\"You two seem close\" Susan stated staring at Caspian fondly\"And you seem to have an eye on my cousin\" I responded , teasing the older girl earning a giggle from her younger sister.\"I do not\" Susan replied slightly flushed \"If it means anything to you he has an eye on you too!\" I said before running up to join Tavros and the other minotaurs leading the group.\"So , what are they like?\" I heard Trufflehunter ,the badger, ask his friend - the dwarf who was kidnapped.\"Complainers ... stubborn as mules in the morning\" Trumpkin responded \"They sound just like the telmarines we took care of\" Nikabrik groaned rolling his eyes and shooting a look in my direction. \"Especially the girl\" he mumbled.\"We are here\" Caspian announced putting a hand out to guide the Kings and Queens to the entrance. I watched as the crowds of Narnians bowed as they took their descent into the how. Respectfully Caspian and I also bowed and waited for them to go through before we then walked in behind them. Lighting a torch I passed one to Caspian as he led us through the passage.\"It's the best we could do on such notice\" I spoke noticing the curious looks on the Pevensie's faces. They all seem enticed by the markings on the wall - the markings that told their stories from their time in Narnia.\"Peter , you may want to see this\" Susan said pointing at one particular carving of the four of them on horses in a forest.\"It's us\" Lucy grinned before turning to Caspian \"What is this place?\" She then asked her expression changing.\"You don't know?\" Caspian said confused. He turned to me and signalled for me to grab the torches. I grabbed them and led the group through a dark tunnel before lighting a fire in the room, illuminating it. The room was full of carvings of Aslan and of Narnians and in the centre of the room was the stone table.\"He must know what he's doing\" Lucy spoke sadly.\"I think it's up to us now\" Peter stated looking at the carvings of Aslan before abruptly leaving the room , Susan and Lucy following after him.\"It must be hard for you\" I spoke \"Coming back after such a long time\"\"Yeah. But I can't say our time back home was anymore enjoyable\" Edmund spoke looking directly at me.\"How so?\" I asked taking a seat on one of the steps and signalling for Edmund to join me.\"We kept trying to find a way back, Peter was the most eager to return. But you can't enter Narnia the same way twice so he kept getting angry. At Aslan mostly , sometimes at us.\" he explained fiddling with the hem on his shirt\"How did you get here the first time?\" I asked curiously , that part never seemed to be in the stories.\"It's going to sound crazy\" Edmund smiled lifting his head up to make eye contact with me.\"Narnia and talking animals is crazy\" I responded with a smile\"We fell through a wardrobe\" he shrugged pausing and waiting for my reaction\"A wardrobe?\" I quizzed a confused laugh escaping me \"Yup\" he chuckled \"We were trying to hide from Mrs Mcreedy. We broke her window.\"\"And so you thought you'd hide in the wardrobe\" I laughed\"Hey, it wasn't my idea\"\"Right. If you say so.\" I replied \"You know, I'm glad that you guys are here\"\"Why? I mean we are supposed to hate you. You are technically a telmarine.\" He bluntly responded \"You guys have given Caspian and I a chance to rebel I suppose. My father doesn't even know that I know how to use a sword he probably thinks I'm dead in these woods\" I sighed \"My new brother and the throne are his only concern.\"\"How well can you use a sword?\" Edmund asked smirking at me\"Well enough\" I bit back catching on quickly to what he was hinting at\"You should duel me, tomorrow\"\"Prepare to lose\""}
