Abrupt environmental\nchanges for a species might lead to changes in the evolutionary process of the\ndescendants to adapt to the environment (Losos, 2011; Mahler, Ingram, Revell,\nand Losos, 2013). The changes in the evolutionary process will be reflected in the\nobserved trait values of present-day species. By detecting abrupt changes based\non observed traits, we can get knowledge of unobserved historical environmental\nchanges and better understand the evolutionary history. The most popular sta-\ntistical models to model the evolutionary process along a phylogenetic tree are\nBrownian Motion (BM, Felsenstein, 1985) and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process\n(Hansen, 1997). Abrupt changes in the evolutionary process are mainly modeled\nby shifts in parameters in these models. Most research in this area focuses on\nthe detection of shifts in mean (BM model) or optimal value (OU model). Butler\nand King (2004) formulate the multiple-optima OU model for adaptive evolu-\ntion. They assume that the optimum is constant along a branch and may differ\nbetween branches due to discrete events where changes in selective regime occur.\nThey test the difference in optima between branches using hypothesis testing.\nUyeda and Harmon (2014) propose a Bayesian framework to detect shifts in the\nselective optimum of OU models. Ho and An´ e (2014) illustrate the limitation of\nAIC and BIC in the shift detection task and introduce modified BIC (Zhang and\nSiegmund, 2006) into the shift detection task. They perform forward-backward\nselection to conduct model selection. Khabbazian et al. (2016) formulate the\nshift detection problem into a variable selection problem and combine the OU\nmodel with LASSO to detect the shift points, which they implement in the\nℓ1ouRpackage. The application of LASSO makes it a fast method. Further,\nthey propose a new information criterion pBIC with correction for phylogenetic\ncorrelations. Bastide et al. (2017) develop a maximum likelihood estimationDETECTION OF SHIFTS IN VARIANCE\nprocedure based on the EM algorithm, which they implement in the Rpackage\nPhylogeneticEM. Zhang et al. (2022) propose an ensemble variable selection\nmethod ( Rpackage ELPASO). They conduct simulations for scenarios when the\ncommon model assumptions are violated and show that measurement error, tree\nconstruction error and shifts in the diffusion variance impact the performances\nof the current methods.\nHowever, these methods only consider shifts in optimal values (mean) with-\nout considering shifts in variances. In reality, when abrupt environmental shifts\noccur, they are likely to not only affect the optimal values but also affect the\nvariances of traits. There are some existing models which allow variance ( σ2)\nto change. Beaulieu et al. (2012) generalize the Hansen model to allow multiple\nvariance parameters and multiple attraction parameters for different selective\nregimes. Mitov et al.

Introduction\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an infectious agent that attacks\nthe immune system, and if not treated properly, it can lead to severe conse-\nquences. It was discovered in 1981 and thereafter it has infected more than\n80 million people and caused the deaths of more than 40 million. By the end\n2of 2021, the World Health Organization estimated that, globally, about 38.4\nmillion people were living with HIV [1]. There are no vaccines for HIV, and\nit cannot be cured yet. Despite this, with regular treatment and high-quality\nhealth care, people living with HIV (PLHIV) can have a life expectancy\ncomparable to that of people not infected by the virus.\nAntiretroviral therapy (ART) has been shown to be effective in controlling\nviral replication for most PLHIV. If no ART is used, HIV-infected patients\ncome to manifest symptoms of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\nCommonly, an ART usually consists of a cocktail of three antiretroviral drugs\nthat cooperatively block virus replication at multiple steps and, compared to\na single drug, are successful in prolonging the time it takes for HIV to become\nresistant to therapy. This success is due to the development of potent and\nwell-tolerated antiretroviral drugs with high genetic barriers to resistance.\nAs a result, it is increasingly common to switch patients under prolonged\nsuccessful therapy to a simplified and highly tolerated regimen, even a dual-\ndrug regimen. However, before a change of therapy, patient records should be\ncarefully analyzed to guide treatment choices and preserve future treatment\noptions. This includes reviewing past drug exposure, treatment failures,\ncumulative drug resistance, and duration of virological suppression [2, 3].\nBy examining the correlation b"}

Several modalities are used in newborns and infants to \ncharacterize the properties of the developing brain, from growth, morphology to microstructure \nand functional specialization.

Early alterations in normal neural development can lead \nto a variety of behavioral disorders  that manifest  in childhood . It is therefore important to gain \na better understanding of these phenomena, which requires linking brain and behavioral \nchanges in vivo . This is why th e use of non -invasive neuroimaging methods such as ‘magnetic \nresonance imaging ’ (MRI) has revolutionized our knowledge in this field over the last twenty \nyears.  \nBefore describing the se recent advances , it is important to remember that MRI  \nmeasurements only indirectly reflect the complex series of dynamic  and intertwined \nmechanisms  observed throughout development  at the molecular, cellular and network  levels , \nwhich occur within a highly constrained but constantly evolving  context  (Stiles and Jernigan \n2010, Kostović, Sedmak et al. 2019) .

Understanding the \nfactors that influence consumer participation in CSA is crucial, yet the complete picture and interrelations \nof these factors remain unclear in existing studies. This research adopts a scoping review and the KJ method \nto elucidate the factors influencing consumer participation in CSA and to theorize t he consumer \nparticipation.  In particular, we focus on the dynamics of individual decision -making for participation, under \nthe premise that individuals are embedded in socio -cultural environments. We examine the decision -\nmaking process based on the seesaw of expected  gains and losses from participation, along with the \nreflexivity to the individual and the process of updating decision -making post -participation. Our study \nhighlights how individual decision -making for participation is influenced by relationships with others \nwithin t he em bedded socio -cultural environment, as well as by attachment and connection to the community. \nIt also shows that discrepancies between expectations and experiences post -participation, and the \ntransformation of the social capital , promote the updating of decision -making processes. Although there \nare limitations, the insights gained from this study offer profound implications for stakeholders and provide \nvaluable insights for more sustainable and efficient CSA practices. This resea rch establishes a robust \nfoundation for future studies on CSA.  \n \nKeywords  \nCommunity -supported agriculture; KJ method; scoping review; consumer participation  \n  2 \n 1. Introduction  \nThe recent push for a sustainable food system has placed a spotlight on developing short food supply \nchains and enhancing direct connections between producers and consumers  (Princen 1997; Francesca \nand Gianluca 2013; Weber, Wiek, and Lang 2020; Clapp 2015) . Community Supported Agriculture \n(CSA) has emerged as a n important development  in this movement  (Woods and Tropp 2017; Vasquez \net al. 2017) . \nIn CSA, a collaborative partnership is formed between producers and consumers. In this \narrangement, consumers pre -pay for a portion of the farm ’s output, providing farmers with a stable \nincome regardless of harvest outcomes. This system also involves consumers in both the risks and \nbenefits associated with farming, creating a shared responsibility and connection to the food \nproduction process. Understanding why consumers join CSAs is crucial to promote and improve these \ninitiatives. By grasping consumer values, expectations, and decision -making factors, CSA farmers  \ncan fine -tune their communication and practices.  \nThe study acknowledges that various factors influence consumer participation in CSA  (Pole and \nGray 2013; Brehm and Eisenhauer 2008; Vassalos, Gao, and Zhang 2017; Vasquez et al. 2017; Kondo \n2021) , but notes that the relationships among these factors are not fully understood and often region -\nspecific  (Savarese, Chamberlain, and Graffigna 2020; Vasquez et al. 2017) .  \nBy clarifying the overall picture of these factors, we can not only provide insights that serve as a \nbasis for formulating expansion strategies, but also make it easier to adapt the model to the \ncharacteristics of  case and plan appropriate interventions. A variety of socioeconomic, psychological, \nand geographic attributes are thought to influence consumers ’ motivations and backgrounds for \nparticipating in CSA. A comprehensive understanding and systematic organization of these factors is \nexpected to provide new insights that will contribute to the spread and development of CSA.  \nIn this study, we aim to identify the factors that influence consumer participation in CSA by \nconducting a scoping review to comprehensively analyze previous research. We intend to illustrate  \nand describe  the relationships among these factors  through the KJ method  and theorize the consumer  \nparticipation  in CSA .

Parasitism is ubiquitous, inevitable, and arises as soon as the first \nreplicators appear, even during the prebiotic stages of evolution. Both in theoretical approaches (computer  \nmodeling and analysis) and in real experiments (replication of biological macromolecules), parasitic \nprocesses emerge almost immediately. An effective way to avoid the elimination of the host -parasite \nsystem is through compartmentalization. In both theory  and experiments, the pressure of parasitism leads \nto the complexification of the host -parasite system into a network of cooperative replicators and their \nparasites. Parasites have the ability to create niches for new replicators. The co -evolutionary arms race \nbetween defense systems and counter -defense mechanisms among parasites and hosts can progress for a \nconsiderable duration, involving multiple stages, if not indefinitely.    \n \nОглавление  \nAbstract  ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .........................  1 \n1.

ВВЕДЕНИЕ: КОМПЛЕКСИФИКАЦИЯ В СИСТЕМЕ ПАРАЗИТ -\nХОЗЯИН  \n \n1.1 Проблема комплексификации в современной биологии  \nВряд ли можно отрицать, что в ходе биологической эволюции сложность если не всех, то \nогромного большинства процессов и механизмов драматически возросла. Действительно, \nнакопленные знания свидетельствуют о том, что на самых ранних этапах жизни организмы были \nорганизованы много проще, чем бол ьшинство современных. Так что проблема усложнения  \n(комплексификации1) процессов и механизмов в эволюции остается одной из актуальных на \nсегодня.   \nРассматривая детально пути эволюции, можно обнаружить этапы появления новых свойств, а \nтакже этапы медленног о изменения существующих. Чтобы смоделировать происхождение новых \nфункций, нам нужен механизм того, как сложное поведение более высокого уровня возникает из \nвзаимодействий низкого уровня [Kaneko, 20061]. Природа, как видно, использует малоизученные и \nдаже  еще неисследованные механизмы эволюционного усложнения.   \nУсложнение генетических программ построения организма из единственной исходной клетки — \nодин из наиболее впечатляющих аспектов становления организации живых существ в эволюции. \nСовременная биология  рассматривает генетические программы в рамках концепции генетических \nсетей, поэтому под усложнением такой программы понимают усложнение  организации \nгенетических сетей (т.е. числа генов в ансамбле и количества функциональных связей между \nними). Наша задача  здесь — понять хотя бы некоторые базовые аспекты усложнения простых \nфункциональных молекулярных ансамблей .   \n1.1.1 Ко-эволюционная гонка вооружений между паразитами  и их хозяевами  \nМногие современные авторы предполагают, что концепция «гонки вооружений» является  лучшей \nсхемой, в которой реорганизации генетического материала и естественный отбор могут привести в \nтечение длительного периода времени к нарастанию сложности [ Dawkins , 19862]. «Гонка \nвооружений» представляет собой усовершенствование эффективности функционирования"}

Cells employ various repair methods known as non-homologous end \njoining (NHEJ ), microhomology mediated end joining ( MMEJ ), and homology -directed recombination \n(HDR). These repair processes may lead to DNA sequence variations (e.g., nucleotide insertions, deletions, \nand substitutions) at the location of the break. Studying DNA DSB repair process es often involves the use \nof high throughput sequencing assays to precisely quantify the sequence variations near the break  with \nsoftware tools . Often methods of assessing and visualizing th ese data have not taken into account  the full \ncomplexity  of the sequencing data, such as the frequency, type, and position of the sequence variations in \na single comprehensive representation . Here we present a method that allows visualization of  the overall \nvariation pattern as well as comparison of  these pattern s among  experimental setups . \n \n \nIntro duction  \nIn recent years, DNA repair of double -strand break ( DSB ) and genome editing  promoted by DSBs \nhave been studied by DNA high throughput sequencing of the genetic material obtained after the DNA \nrepair of experimentally induced breaks , frequently by CRISPR/Cas9 assays, at specific locations in a  \ngenetic sequence1–3. In the case of  breaks induced in DNA within cell environments, the  repair  may be done  by one of the natural repair processes, including the error  prone non-homologous end -joining  (NHEJ)  or \nmicrohomology  mediated end -joining  (MMEJ ) pathways , or the  precise  homology- directed repair (HDR) \npathway tha t could  be used for genome editing4–6. To study the repaired DNA,  a process known as targeted \namplicon sequencing (or targeted next generation sequencin g (NGS), amplicon sequencing , amplicon deep \nsequencing , etc.)  is used , where primers are applied near  locations around the DSB that allow amplification \nof the sequence around the repaired DSB that is then  sequence d with high -throughput sequencing \ntechnolog ies7. The resulting sequencing reads are  aligned to the expected repair outcome, called the \nreference sequence  (or reference amplicon , amplicon sequence , amplicon,  etc.), to detect and quantify the \nvariations (insertions, deletions, and substitutions) near the DSB site resulting from the repair process.  The \nhuge amount of data produced by high- throughput sequencing platforms , such as Illumina HiSeq8, call for \nautomated tools and various software to analyze the data . Such software tools include  CRISPR-GA9, \nAGEseq10, CrispRVariants11, CRISPResso12, BATCH-GE13, Cas-Analyzer14, CRISPR-DAV15, \nHi-FiBR16, RIMA17, CRISPResso218, ampliCan19, and PEM-Q20. However, these tools have not \nconsidered  the full  information contained in the  sequencing data and often  summarize  the distribution of \ninsertions and deletions (indel s) using figures  focused on a couple of properties of the data. For example,  \nsuch figures may include 2D histograms showing indel frequency vs. positions on the reference  sequence \nor indel frequency  vs. length of indel  (e.g., CRISPR-GA, CRISPResso, Cas-Analyzer, CRISPR-\nDAV, and CRISPResso2 ) though some tools  also show  a list of  the most frequently occurring variants \naligned to the reference sequence (e.g., CrispRVariants, BATCH-GE, Cas-Analyzer , RIMA , \nCRISPResso2, and ampliCan ). \nHere we present  DSBplot, a software tool developed to represent sequence variations and their \nrespective frequencies in libraries obtained from targeted amplicon sequencing.

Her\ndata provide information about the potential benefits of these two options. Unfortunately, these\ndata only partially identify payoff-relevant parameters and may therefore not reveal, even in large\nsamples, the correct course of action. Such treatment choice problems with partial identification\nhave recently received growing interest; for example, see D’Adamo (2021), Ishihara and Kitagawa\n(2021), Yata (2021), Christensen, Moon, and Schorfheide (2022), Kido (2022) or Manski (2022).\nSeveral interesting problems that arise in empirical research can be recast using this framework. A\nnon-exhaustive list includes extrapolation of experimental estimates for policy adoption (Ishihara\nand Kitagawa, 2021; Menzel, 2023), policy-making with quasi-experimental data in the presence\nof omitted variable bias (Diegert, Masten, and Poirier, 2022), and extrapolation of Local Average\nTreatment Effects (Mogstad, Santos, and Torgovitsky, 2018; Mogstad and Torgovitsky, 2018).\nIn this paper, we analyze such problems in terms of Wald’s (1950) Statistical Decision Theory,\nidentifying theoretical and practical challenges as well as new research opportunities. We do so in\na finite-sample framework characterized by a Gaussian likelihood and partial identification. We see\nour main goals as clearly articulating the challenges of applying standard decision-theoretic criteria\nand exploring some resulting research opportunities, not as advocating a specific criterion (e.g.,\nminimax regret) for recommending decision rules.\nChallenges: Three optimality criteria are routinely used to endorse or discard decision rules:\nadmissibility ,maximin welfare , andminimax regret . We highlight challenges in applying these\ncriteria in our setting.\nAdmissibility. A decision rule is (welfare-)admissible if one cannot improve its expected welfare\nuniformly over the parameter space. This is usually considered a weak requirement for a decision\nrule to be considered “good”. We show that, whenever problems in our setting exhibit partial\nidentification, everydecision rule, no matter how exotic, is admissible (Theorem 1).\nMaximin Welfare. A decision rule is maximin(-welfare) optimal if it attains the highest worst-\ncase expected welfare. Echoing earlier critiques from Savage (1951) to Manski (2004), we find that\nmaximin decision rules will preserve the status quo regardless of the data (Theorem 2).\nMinimax Regret. A decision rule is minimax-regret (MMR) optimal if it attains the lowest\nworst-case expected regret, where an action’s regret is its welfare loss relative to the action that\nwould be optimal if payoff-relevant parameters were known. In some point-identified treatment\nchoice problems, the MMR rule is both essentially unique and nonrandomized (Canner, 1970; Stoye,\n22009a;Tetenov,2012). Thismaynotnotbetr"}

A statistical analysis of the time intervals between subsequent IP 3R-\nmediated Ca2+pulses observed experimentally has revealed an exponential dependence\nwith the external stimulus strength in several cell types. This type of dependence,\nwhich is reminiscent of Kramers’ law for thermally activated barrier crossing, has also\nbeen derived for certain excitable systems. Excitable systems have a stable stationary\nsolution and, upon perturbations that surpass a threshold, perform a long excursion\nin phase space before returning to equilibrium. In this paper we use a very simple\nmathematical model of IP 3R-mediated Ca2+signals and published experimental results\nto derive the scaling law between the interpulse time and the external stimulus strength.\n1. Introduction\nCells continuously interact with their surroundings, not only to exchange nutrients\nand energy, but also to detect environmental changes and act accordingly [43].\nVery frequently changes in the environment are endowed in concentration changes of\nsubstances that can bind to plasma membrane receptors. This, in turn, induces changes\nin the concentration and/or activation level of various intracellular components in what\nis known as a signaling cascade . Cells use different strategies to go from the external\nstimulus to the end response [44, 30, 14]. Sometimes, increasing intensities of the\nexternal stimulus are “encoded” in increasing concentrations of the internal messengers\n(amplitude codification) [48]. On other occasions, stimuli induce a pulsatile behavior in\nsome of the intermediaries in which the frequency increases with the stimulus strengtharXiv:2312.17629v1  [q-bio.CB]  29 Dec 2023Frequency encoding and excitability 2\n(frequency encoding) [4, 5]. This last behavior has been observed in intracellular Ca2+\nsignals [7, 42] that involve Ca2+release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through\nInositol Trisphosphate Receptors (IP 3Rs) [12].\nCa2+is ubiquitous as intracellular messenger. It is involved in the control of many\ncellular functions including both fertilization and cell death [2]. On many occasions,\nthe selective control of specific targets depends on the spatio-temporal of the cytosolic\nCa2+concentration. Ca2+release from the ER through IP 3Rs give cells the tools to\nproduce different spatio-temporal patterns. On one hand, IP 3Rs need to bind IP 3and\nCa2+to become open. Therefore, the opening of one such channel can lead to the\nopening of many others due to Calcium Induced Calcium Release [11]. IP 3Rs, in turn,\nare usually organized in clusters containing ∼10−20 channels. Furthermore, high Ca2+\nconcentrations inhibit IP 3Rs. Thus, the signals can range from blips andpuffs involving\nCa2+release from one channel or cluster, to waves that propagate throughout the cell\ndepending on the level of IP 3[46, 40, 39] and the interplay between Ca2+activation and\ninhibition. In many different cell types, constant stimulation with extracellular ligands\ncan yield sequences of these waves that, when the interior of the cell is not resolved, are\nvisualized with fluorescence microscopy techniques as sequences of Ca2+spikes [7, 42].\nUsually each Ca2+spike is preceded by localized signals which start to occur more\nfrequently until they yield the global release event [29]. This is typical of spatially\nextended excitable systems in which random local (Ca2+release) events are amplified\nthrough space eventually triggering an “extreme” one (a Ca2+spike) [26, 18]. We\nhereby recall the defining characteristics of excitable systems: the existence of a stable\nstationary state, a threshold which, if surpassed by perturbations, a long excursion in\nphase space occurs before the system returns to the stationary solution and a refractory\nperiod before a new spike can be elicited by perturbations [19].\nA systematic study of intracellular Ca2+pulses evoked by constant concentrations\nof extracellular ligands showed, in many cell types, that the interspike "}

Despite a vast cross-sectional literature on the downward bias of\nrobust standard errors, the problem is not extensively covered in the panel data framework. We\ninvestigate the consequences of the simultaneous presence of small sample size, heteroskedas-\nticity and data points that exhibit extreme values in the covariates (‘good leverage points’) on\nthe statistical inference. Focusing on one-way linear panel data models, we examine asymp-\ntotic and finite sample properties of a battery of heteroskedasticity-consistent estimators using\nMonte Carlo simulations. We also propose a hybrid estimator of the variance-covariance matrix.\nResults show that conventional standard errors are always dominated by more conservative esti-\nmators of the variance, especially in small samples. In addition, all types of HC standard errors\nhave excellent performances in terms of size and power tests under homoskedasticity.\nJEL codes: C13, C15, C23.\nKeywords: cluster-robust standard errors, jackknife methods, test size, power of test.\n1 Introduction\nWhen the assumption of homoskedasticity is violated and the disturbances show non-constant vari-\nance (within the cross-sectional timention, or time dimension, or both), least squares (LS) esti-\nmators are no longer efficient. Consequently, standard errors based on the incorrect assumption\nof homoskedastic disturbances lead to misleading statistical inferences. A common practice is to\naccount for heteroskedasticity with robust standard errors when estimating the model. The Eicker-\nHuber-White (EHW) estimator (Eicker, 1967; Huber et al., 1967; White, 1980) has become the\nnorm to account for any degree of heteroskedasticity in the cross-sectional environment. Its coun-\nterpart for the panel data is the Arellano’s (1987) formula. The presence of data points that exhibit\nextreme values in the covariates – i.e., good leverage points – makes the EHW estimator system-\natically downward biased leading to liberal statistical inferences (Long and Ervin, 2000; Godfrey,\n2006; Hayes and Cai, 2007; MacKinnon, 2013; Şimşek and Orhan, 2016). The bias is severe when\nthe cross-sectional sample size is sufficiently small (e.g., with less than 250 units in the sample), and\npersists even in large samples (MacKinnon and White, 1985; Chesher and Jewitt, 1987; Silva, 2001;\n∗Institute of Analytics and Data Science (IADS) and Centre for Micro-Social Change (MiSoc), University of Essex.\nEmail: annalivia.polselli@essex.ac.uk.

While much discussion has involved the cross-sectional framework, little\nhas been investigated for panel data, despite similar issues of Arellano’s (1987) standard errors.1.\nIn this paper, we investigate the consequences of the simultaneous presence of small\nsample size, good leveraged data, and heteroskedastic disturbances on the validity of the statistical\ninference in linear panel data models. We formalise panel versions of MacKinnon and White’s\n(1985) and Davidson et al.’s (1993) estimators, and propose a new hybrid estimator, PHC 6, that\npenalises only units with high leverage in the covariates. We derive the asymptotic distributions\nof this battery of estimators, and analyse their finite sample properties with Monte Carlo (MC)\nsimulationsintermsofproportionalbias, rejectionprobability(orempiricalsize), rootmeansquared\nerror, and adjusted power. The analysis is conducted across different panel sample sizes and degrees\nof heteroskedasticity. Units are randomly contaminated with good leverage points. While we treat\nhomoskedasticity as a special case, heteroskedasticity is assumed to be a core component of the\ncorrect regression specification.\nWe find that under heteroskedasticity and with good leveraged data test statistics ob-\ntained with Arellano’s (1987) standard errors are, as expected, over-sized, upward biased, and with\nlow power, especially when the panel size is smaller than 2,500 observations. Test statistics cal-\nculated with PHC6 formula mimic the behaviour of those based on jackknife standard errors in\nterms of bias, empirical size and adjusted power test, converging to the same rates as the sam-\nple size increases.

We show\nthat the spatial patterns of expression for several of these genes scale precisely with the size of the\nembryo. Concretely, discrete positional markers such as the peaks in striped patterns have absolute\npositions along the anterior–posterior axis that are proportional to embryo length, with better than\n1% accuracy. Further, the information (in bits) that graded patterns of expression provide about\nposition can be decomposed into information about fractional or scaled position and information\nabout absolute position or embryo length; all of the available information is about scaled position,\nagain with ∼1% accuracy. These observations suggest that the underlying genetic network exhibits\nscale invariance in a deeper mathematical sense. Taking this mathematical statement seriously\nrequires that the network dynamics have a zero mode, which connects to many other observations\non this system.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nClosely related organisms can vary widely in size, but\nvariations in their proportions are much smaller [1–3].\nThere is a considerable gap between this qualitative ob-\nservation and some precise mathematical statement of\nscaling, e.g., that the linear dimensions of all elements in\nthe body plan are in direct proportion to the linear di-\nmensions of the organism. If correct this scale invariance\nwould be visible not only in the fully developed organism\nbut already at some earlier stages in its development.\nThere are many examples of “allometric scaling,”\npower-law relationships among different quantities across\na well-defined class of organisms [4–6]. In some cases,\nthese relations connect the linear dimensions of different\nbody parts. Nonetheless, truly precise spatial scaling in\nembryonic development would be quite surprising.\nWe understand the mechanisms of pattern formation in\na wide range of non–biological systems, from fluid flows\nto crystal growth (snowflakes) and more [7–12], but none\nof these examples exhibit scale invariance. Instead, the\nelements of the pattern have linear dimensions set by\nmicroscopic parameters, and larger systems exhibit more\nrepetitions of the same pattern rather than expansion\nor contraction of pattern elements to match the size of\nthe system as a whole [13]. Going back to the pioneer-\ning work of Turing [14], the mathematical structure of\nthe equations governing these systems is not so different\nfrom the structure of models for genetic or biochemical\nnetworks. If we take these analogies literally, we would\npredict that taller people should have more vertebrae,\nwhich is obviously wrong. Is there a real problem here,\nor are we just oversimplifying?Here we try to make the notion of scale invariance in\ndevelopment more precise. We use the first hours of de-\nvelopment in the fruit fly as an example, following spa-\ntial patterns of morphogen concentration as they flow\nthrough three layers of a genetic network, from maternal\ninputs to the gap genes to the pair rule genes [15–17]. In\nthe spirit of earlier work [18–22] we analyze discrete po-\nsitional markers, such as the stripes in pair rule-gene ex-\npression, and find that positions of these markers vary in\nproportion to the length of the embryo with better than\n1% accuracy [23]. We then go beyond discrete markers,\ndecomposing the information carried by graded patterns\nof gap gene expression into information about fractional\nor scaled position vs. information about the absolute po-\nsition; we find that all the available information is about\nfractional position along the anterior–posterior axis. In-\nformation that would signal a deviation from scale invari-\nance is less than 1% of the total.\nThese results provide strong evidence for scaling in a\nprecise mathematical sense, for both the gap genes and\nthe pair rule genes. But at least one of the maternal\ninputs, Bicoid [24, 25], does not show any sign of scale\ninvariance: as in well-understood non-biological pattern-\nforming systems, there is a length scale that presumably\nis set by underlying molecular parameters and does not\nadjust in respon"}
