Introduction\nChristian [6] introduced an eight dimensional octonion lik e associative normed di-\nvision algebra over R. Well known Hurwitz theorem states that R,C,HandOare\nthe only four normed division algebras over R. Khalid and Bouchard [5] noted that\noctonion like algebra is a seminormed division algebra, i.e . division by any number X\nin octonion like algebra is possible if and only if /bardblX/bardbl/ne}ationslash=0. This octonion like algebra\nis different from the algebra of octonions Obecause it is associative and has six imagi-\nnary and two real units where as the algebra of octonions Ois non-associative and has\nseven imaginary and one real units. Jordan attempted to use t he algebra of octonions\nto transfer the probabilistic interpretation of quantum th eory, which is not successful\ndue to non-associativity of the octonions. Hopf algebra [14 ] was introduced by Hopf\nPreprint submitted to .... January 3, 2024which is related to the concept of H-space in Algebraic Topology. To see nonasso-\nciative algebras as an associative algebra, Albuquerque an d Majid [1] introduced the\ngroup graded quasialgebras, which are algebraic structure s on the direct sum of homol-\nogy and cohomology groups on an H-space in algebraic topology. Linear Gr-categories\n[9] is the category of ﬁnite group graded vector space, which has applications in tensor\ncategories [4], quantum groups [12], cohomology of groups a nd representation theory\n[13]. Balodi et al. [3] proved that every expression in a G-gr aded quasialgebra can\nbe reduced to a unique irreducible form and the irreducible w ords form a basis for the\nquasi-algebra, known as Diamond lemma.\nIn this article, we generalize the octonion-like algebra an d introduce a 16 dimen-\nsional sedenion-like algebra which is an even subalgebra of 25-dimensional Clifford\nalgebra Cl5,0[1]. This algebra is different from the algebra of sedenion a s it is associa-\ntive and has six imaginary and ten real units, while the algeb ra of sedenions has one real\nand ﬁfteen imaginary units. We split the 16-dimensional sed enion number as dual of\noctonion like numbers and deﬁne norm on it. Note that this alg ebra is a normed algebra\nbut not a normed division algebra so it does not contradict th e Hurwitz’s theorem. We\nalso prove that the sedenion-like elements S,Tpreserves the condition /bardblST/bardbl=/bardblS/bardbl/bardblT/bardbl\nandSS†is commutative [i.e. SS†=S†Sand(SS†)T=T(SS†)]. Also, it does not give\nthe 16 square formula because in sedenion-like algebra we de ﬁne the norm by us-\ning the condition SrS†\nd+SdS†\nr=0, which implies that s0s15=∑i=7\ni=1sis15−iands0s8=\n∑i=7\ni=1sis8+i, where S=s0+s1λeoe1+s2λeoe2+s3λeoe3+s4λe1e2+s5λe3e1+\ns6λe2e3+s7λeoe1e2e3+s8λeoe4+s9λe1e4+s10λe2e4+s11λe3e4+s12λeoe2e1e4+\ns13λeoe1e3e4+s14λeoe3e2e4+s15λe1e2e3e4is a sedenion-like number. Hence all\ncoefﬁcients are algebraically dependent . Associativity o f sedenion-like algebra is an\nimportant property for the physical application of algebra s. Jordan attempted to use the\nalgebra of octonions and sedenions to transfer the probabil istic interpretation of quan-\ntum theory in dimension 8 and 16 respectively, which was not s uccessful due to non-\nassociativity of the octonions and sedenions. Due to the ass ociativity of octonion-like\nand sedenion-like algebras, these can be used to transfer th e probabilistic interpretation\nof the quantum theory in Jordan problem.\nThe outline of the article is as follows: In section 2, an over view of 8-dime"}

In\nthis paper, our focus is on the Rd-valued discrete time Markov process ( Xδ\nt)t∈πδdeﬁned as follows:\nXδ\nt+δ=ψ(Xδ\nt,t,δ1\n2Zδ\nt+δ,δ), t∈πδ, Xδ\n0=xδ\n0∈Rd.

Additionally, this process satisﬁes the\nregularization property: For every α,β∈Nd, there exists C:Rd×πδ,∗→R+(which does not depend\nonδ) such that for every t∈πδ,∗and everyf∈ C∞(Rd;R), bounded,\n|∂α\nxE[∂β\nxf(Xδ\nt)|Xδ\n0=x]|/lessorequalslantC(x,t)/ba∇⌈blf/ba∇⌈bl∞.

A main applica tion of those\nresults is provided in Theorem 2.2, where we identify a total variation limit (along with explicit rate of\nconvergence) for Xδ\nt,t∈πδ, asδtends to zero.

The only description of bases for free Lie supe ralgbras that I have\nfound in the literature is in the book Inﬁnite Dimensional Lie Superalgebras by\nBahturin et al. [1]. Their bases make use of the theory of Shir shov bases in free Lie\nalgebras, and I believe that there is a case for writing up an a lternative approach\nusing basic commutators. An additional reason for publishi ng this note is that I\nuse the basis described here in a forthcoming paper where I pr ove that 5-Engel Lie\nalgebras of characteristic pforp >7 are nilpotent of class at most 11.\n1 Introduction\nLetLbeafreeLiealgebraover acommutative ring Rwith1, andlet Lhave freegenerating\nsetA. ThenLis a free R-module, and there are three standard ways described in the\nliterature for obtaining a basis for LoverR. The ﬁrst two are due to Lyndon [2] and\nShirshov [3], and the third uses Philip Hall’s collection process. To obtain a Shirshov basis\nwe proceed as follows. We let A∗be the set of all associative words a1a2...an(n≥1)\nwherea1,a2,...,a n∈AIfu=a1a2...an∈A∗andv=b1b2...bm∈A∗then we set\nuv=a1a2...anb1b2...bm,\nturningA∗into a semigroup. We assume that there is a total order <on the set A, and\nifu,v∈A∗we letu < vifuis lexicographically earlier than v. We say that a1a2...anis\nregularif\na1a2...an> ai+1ai+2...ana1a2...ai\nfor alli= 1,2,...,n−1. (So elements of Aare regular.) We then deﬁne a map πfrom\nthe set of regular words into Las follows. If a∈Athen we let π(a) =a. Ifwis a regular\nword of length greater than 1 then we write w=uvwherevis chosen to have maximal\nlength subject to vbeing regular and being a proper subword of w. It turns out that this\n1choice of vimplies that uis also regular. Then we recursively deﬁne π(uv) = [π(u),π(v)].\nFor a proof that the image of πis a basis for L(the Shirshov basis) see Chapter 2 of [1].\nThe proof takes about 10 pages, and is extremely technical!\nThe Lyndon basis is deﬁned similarly. A Lyndon word is an element a1a2...an∈A∗\nsuch that\na1a2...an< ai+1ai+2...ana1a2...ai\nfor alli= 1,2,...,n−1. (Elements of Aare Lyndon words.) We deﬁne a map θfrom the\nset of Lyndon words into L. Ifa∈Athen we let θ(a) =a. And if wis a Lyndon word of\nlength greater than 1 we write w=uvwherevis chosen to have maximal length subject\ntovbeing a Lyndon word, and vbeing a proper subword of w. And as with the Shirshov\nbasis we recursively set θ(uv) = [θ(u),θ(v)]. The set {θ(w)|wis a Lyndon word }is the\nLyndon basis for L.\nThe third method of obtaining a basis for Las a free R-module is to show that the\nbasic commutators (or basic Lie products) on the free generator sAform an R-module\nbasis for L.\nThe basic commutators of weight one are the elements a∈A, which we assume to be\nan ordered set.\nThe basic commutators of weight two are the elements [ a,b] wherea,b∈Aanda > b.\nThese areorderedarbitrarilyamongthemselves, andso thatthey followbasiccommutators\nof weight one.\nThe basic commutators of weight three are the elements [ a,b,c] wherea,b,c∈Aand\na > b≤c. (We use the left-normed convention so that [ a,b,c] denotes [[ a,b],c].) The basic\ncommutators of weight three are ordered arbitrarily among thems elves, and so that they\nfollow the basic commutators of weight two.\nIn general, if k >3 the basic commutators of weight kare the commutators [ c,d] where\nfor some m,nsuch that m+n=k,\n1.c,dare basic commutators of weight m,nrespectively,\n2.c > d,\n3. if, in the deﬁnition of basic commutators of weight m,cwas deﬁned to be [ e,f] then\nf≤d.\nThe basic commutators of weight kare then ordered arbitrarily among themselves, and\nso that they follow the basic commutators of weight k−1.\nA proof that the basic commutators form an R-module basis for Lcan be found in my\nbook [4].\n22 Lie superalgebras\nA Lie superalgebra is a Z2-graded algebra L=L0⊕L1with a bilinear product [ ,] such\nthat\n[L0,L0],[L1,L1]≤L0,\n[L0,L1],[L1,L0]≤L1.\nElements in L0are said to be even elements, and elements in L1are said to be odd. If a\nis even then we set |a|= 0, and if ais odd then we set |a|= 1. Odd elements and even\nelements are said to be homogeneous. Finally, the product [ ,] must satisfy the following\nrelations for all homogeneous elements a,b,c.\n[b,a] =−(−1)|a|.|b|[a,b].\n(−1)|a|.|c|[a,[b,c]]+(−1)|b|.|a|[b,[c,a]]+(−1)|c|.|b|[c,[a,b]] = 0.\nIt is helpful to note that these relations imply that if a,b,care homogeneous elements then\n[a,[b,c]] = [a,b,c]−(−1)|b|.|c|[a,c,b].\nWe also add in the requirement that [ a,a] = 0 for even elements, and the requirement\nthat [a,a,a] = 0 for odd elements. (These extra requirements are redundant if 2 and 3 are\ninvertible.)\nNow letL=L0⊕L1be a free Lie superalgebra over a ring Rwith 1, freely generated\nby an ordered set ( A,<). We assume that the elements of Aare homogeneous, some even\nand some odd. Let S={π(w)|wis a regular word in A∗}, and let ( C,<) be a"}

Introduction  \nThe first use of  the pairwise comparisons may be  attributed to Ramon Llull in the 13th -century  [1] [2]. \n“The Law of Comparative Judgments” was developed for the psychological research in  [3]. [4] developed \npairwise comparison based on paired ratio scale to establish Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) [5] and \nAnalytic Network Process (ANP) [6].  [7, 8]   proposed the Cognitive Network Process (CNP) based on \nPairwise Opposite Matrix . The AHP should not be equated with pairwise comparisons [2], as several forms \nof PCs exist.  While increasing uses of the AHP , the AHP  is controversial , for examples, arbitrary hierarchic \ncomposition [9] [10] [11], conflict of  expected utility theory [12, 13] , defending eighteen critics of AHP \n[14], and rank reversals [15] [16] [17]. \nThe prioritization  method for AHP  is one of unsettled controversial  topic s. The default and early \nprioritization method proposed by  [4] in AHP was  Eigenvector method  and [5] introduced normalization \nmethods including  Normalization of the Row Sum, Normalization of Reciprocals of Column Sum,  and \nArithmetic Mean of Normalized Columns , which the methods were termed based on [18] as [5] did not \nprovide  the names for th em. [19] proposed the Direct Least Squares (DLS) and Weighted Least Squares \n(WLS) methods.

The rest of this paper is summarized as follows. The related work with \nmotivations for this study is presented in Section 2. The Pseudo -IGM, Normalized -IGM , and Langragian -\nIGM  methods  are developed in Section 3. Two numerical examples are demonstrated for the usability of \nIGMs in Section 4.

Employ-\ning relaxed controls provides a convenient approach to guarantee the existence of\na minimiser for the control problem, even when an optimal classical c ontrol may\nnot exist [43]. The relaxed control perspective also oﬀers a principle d framework\nfor designing eﬃcient algorithms. It has been observed that the us e of relaxed\ncontrols, along with additional regularization terms, improves algor ithm stability\nand eﬃciency [20, 57, 56, 58].

Therefore, so is its pullback π:Uf→\nU. The (one variable, homological, with rational coeﬃcients )Alexander modules of the pair ( U,f) are\nthe homology groups Hi(Uf,Q) fori≥0. They naturally have an automorphism, given by the eﬀect\nin homology of the counterclockwise generator of π1(C∗), seen as a deck transformation. This gives\nthem the structure of a Q[t±1]-module.\nOne motivation for this construction is the following analo gy: suppose that f:U→S1is a locally\ntrivial ﬁbration. Then, an inﬁnite cyclic cover Uf→Ucan be constructed by pulling back the\nuniversal covering map R→S1. In this case, the map /tildewidef:Uf→Rappearing in the pullback diagram\nis a locally trivial ﬁbration over a contractible base, so Ufis homotopy equivalent to the ﬁber of the\nmap/tildewidef, or equivalently, to the ﬁber of f. Therefore, Hi(Uf,Q) will compute the homology of the ﬁber.\nIn our situation, fis an algebraic map to C∗≃S1, and it need not be a locally trivial ﬁbration, but\nit may be thought of as a generalization of the homology of the ﬁber.\nA well-known example is the following situation: let f:Cn→Cbe a non-constant polynomial,\ncutting out a hypersurface H⊂Cn.

The fundamental theorem\nconcerning mixed Hodge structures, due to Deligne [ 2], states that the (co)homology of complex\nalgebraic varieties has a mixed Hodge structure. The coveri ngsUfthat we are concerned with are\nnot algebraic varieties in general, and the corresponding A lexander modules are ﬁnitely generated\nR-modules, but not necessarily ﬁnite dimensional over Q. As a result, to develop a Hodge theory\nfor the homology of Uf, one needs to extract meaningful ﬁnite dimensional Q-vector spaces from the\nAlexander modules.

We provide information\non the minimal free resolutions of the logarithmic derivation module of A, which can be\nused to compute a lower bound for the graded Betti numbers of the resolution.\nSpecifically, for the three-dimensional case, we determine the minimal free resolution\nof the logarithmic derivation module of A. We present illustrative examples of our main\ntheorems to provide insights into the relationship between algebraic and combinatorial\nproperties for close-to-free arrangements.\n1 Introduction\nLetVbe the ℓ-dimensional vector space Kℓover a field K. The coordinate ring S=Sym(V∗)∼=\nK[x1,···, xℓ] is equipped with the usual grading and its degree ihomogeneous part is denoted\nbySi. A (central) hyperplane arrangement Ais a finite set of linear hyperplanes in V. For\na hyperplane H∈A, the defining linear form is denoted by αH∈S1with H= ker αH. The\ndefining polynomial Q(A) ofAis defined as Q(A) =Q\nH∈AαH, and it is defined up to a\nscalar multiple. One of the most important algebraic invariants associated to an arrangement\nAis its logarithmic derivation module D(A) defined by\nD(A) ={θ∈DerS|θ(αH)∈SαHfor any H= ker αH∈A},\nwhere Der Sis the free S-module of derivations generated by {∂xi|1≤i≤ℓ}. Given a\nderivation θ=Pℓ\ni=1fi∂xi∈D(A), we say it is homogeneous if all fi∈Sdfor some d∈Z≥0,\nand we write deg θ=d. Generally, D(A) is a reflexive graded S-module [11] and is not\nalways free. If D(A) is free, then there exist homogeneous derivations θ1,···, θℓ∈D(A) such\nthat D(A) =Lℓ\ni=1Sθi. In this situation, we say that Ais free with exponents exp(A) =\n(d1,···, dℓ), where di= deg θi.\nThe study of D(A) has focused primarily on the case when it is free (see [16] for a survey).\nMuch remains unexplored when it is not free. In order to understand non-free cases, a natural\napproach is to look at their graded minimal free resolution. Some works consider the degrees\n(the Betti numbers) of the graded minimal free resolution [4, 7, 12]. In particular, [14, 15] study\nthederivation degree sequence , denoted as DS( A), which is defined as the unordered sequence\n∗Graduate School of Mathematics, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, 819-0395, Japan.\nEmail:chu.junyan.949@s.kyushu-u.ac.jp.\n2020 Mathematics Subject Classification. 52C35, 14N20.\nThe author has been supported by the China Scholarship Council.\n1arXiv:2401.01212v1  [math.AC]  2 Jan 2024of the degrees of the minimal homogeneous generators of D(A). Moreover, we use |DS(A)|\nto represent the number of the minimal homogeneous generators of D(A). In cases where A\nis free, we have DS( A) = exp( A). Although minimal homogeneous generators are not unique,\ntheir degrees do not depend on the choice since they are the degrees of Tor 0(K, D(A)). One\nof the main challenges in the study of non-free arrangements is that the determination of these\ntwo algebraic properties of D(A) is generally influenced not only by the combinatorics of A\nbut also by its geometry (see Example 4.8).\nTo tackle this issue, our initial approach involves examining arrangements that are close to\nfree arrangements. This is inspired by the next-to-free minus (NT-free-minus) defined by Abe.\nDefinition 1.1 (Definition 1.3 and 6.1 in [1]) .We say that Bis next-to-free minus (NT-free\nminus) if there exist a free arrangement Aand a hyperplane H∈Asuch that B=A\\ {H}.\nIn this case, we say Ais afree addition ofB.\nNow we introduce a class of arrangement, which has a nice structure called strictly plus-one\ngenerated (SPOG) , closely related to the NT-free-minus arrangement.\nDefinition 1.2 (Definition 1.1 in [1]) .An arrangement Bis said to be strictly plus-\none generated (SPOG) with exponents POexp( B) = ( d1,···, dℓ)and level d, if there exist\nf1,···, fℓ, α∈Swith α̸= 0 such that D(B)has a minimal free resolution of the following\nform:\n0→S[−d−1](α,f1,···,fℓ)− − − − − − → S[−d]⊕ ℓM\ni=1S[−di]!\n→D(B)→0.\nIn particular, DS(B) = (d1,···, dℓ, d) = (POexp( B), d).\nAbe [1] shows that an NT-free-minus arrangement Bis either free or SPOG. If Bis SPOG\nand NT-free-minus, the level of Bcan be determined by the combinatorial properties of its\nfree addition. To state his results, let us recall that the definition of the intersection lattice of\nA, denoted by L(A), as follows:\nL(A) :=(\\\nH∈BH|B⊂A)\n,\nwhere L(A) is equipped with a partial order induced by reverse inclusion. For a given X∈\nL(A), the localization AXofAatXis defined by\nAX:={H∈A|X⊂H},\nand the restriction AXofAonto Xis defined by\nAX:={H∩X|H∈A\\AX}.\nThe following is a significant theorem about NT-free-minus arrangements, which plays a\ncrucial role in shaping our results.\nTheorem 1.3 (Theorem 1.4 and Proposition 5.3 in [1]) .LetAbe free with exp(A) =\n(d1,···, dℓ)andH∈A.ThenA′=A\\{H}is free, or SPOG with POexp( A′) = (d1,···, dℓ)\nand leve"}

Introduction. In the pasttwodecadesalargetoolboxofﬁnite element meth-\nods for solving scalarpartial diﬀerential equations (PDEs) on evolving surfaces has\nbeen developed. The probably most prominent method is the evolving surface ﬁ-\nnite element method (ESFEM) [4, 5, 14]. This is an elegant and popular m ethod\nfor which a complete error analysis has been developed [6, 5]. A key fe ature of this\nmethod is that it is based on a Lagrangian approach in which a triangula tion of the\ninitial surface and a corresponding ﬁnite element space are transp orted along the ﬂow\nlines of a (given) velocity ﬁeld. This makes the method attractive for problems with\nsmoothly and slowly varying surfaces. There are also recent contr ibutions [24, 15] in\nwhich the ESFEM is applied to problems with geometric singularities (e.g. droplet\npinch-oﬀ). It is, however, well-known that such Lagrangian techn iques have draw-\nbacks if the geometry of the surface is strongly varying on the rele vant time scales or\nif there are topological singularities, e.g., merging or splitting phenom ena. Another\nﬁnite element technique for PDEs on evolving surfaces is introduced in [17]. This\nmethod is based on an Eulerian approach in which the stabilized trace ﬁ nite element\nmethod (TraceFEM) is used for spatial discretization and combined with standard\nﬁnite diﬀerences (BDF) for the time discretization. With such an Euc lidean approach\nit is easier to handle topological singularities. Furthermore, if the su rface PDE is cou-\npled with a bulk PDE, the use of TraceFEM, which is based on standard bulk ﬁnite\nelement spaces, may lead to advantages concerning the implementa tion. In [17] an\nerror analysis of this method is presented for BDF1 combined with hig her order ﬁnite\nelements for spatial discretization. In this analysis geometry erro rs are treated but\nthere is an issue concerning suﬃciently accurate numerical integra tion on the approx-\nimate surface [17, Remark 4.1]. Yet another approach, also of Euler ian type, has been\nintroduced in [20, 19] and uses the TraceFEM or CutFEM principle not only in space\nbut in space-time. In other words, the discretization of the evolvin g surface PDE uses\na restriction to the space-time surface of standard space-time ﬁ nite element spaces\non a ﬁxed bulk (tensor product) space-time mesh. In the framewo rk of CutFEM this\nis a natural approach for this class of partial diﬀerential equation s.

Such level set representations are often u sed for problems with\nstrongly varying surface geometries or with topological singularitie s.\nIn this paper we treat this space-time TraceFEM. Its main charact eristics are the\nfollowing. The method is of Eulerian type, using a (per time step) ﬁxed unﬁtted bulk\nspatial triangulation and corresponding standard space-time (te nsor product) ﬁnite\nelement spaces. As input for the method one needs a level set repr esentation of the\nevolving surface. If a suﬃciently accurate (made precise further on in the paper) level\nsetfunction approximationisavailableandhigherorderbulkspace-t imeﬁnite element\nspaces are used, the resulting surface PDE discretization method is also of (optimal)\nhigherorderaccuracyforsmoothlyvaryingsurfaceswith suﬃcien tlysmoothsolutions.\nWithout any modiﬁcations the method can also be used for the discre tization of\nproblems with topological singularities. Of course, in such singular ca ses one can not\nexpect global higher order convergence. In [20, 19] the method w as introduced for\npiecewise linears (in space and time) and the issue of geometry appro ximation was\nnot considered. In the recent paper [23] the method was extend ed in two directions.\nFirstly, a higher order variant was intro"}
