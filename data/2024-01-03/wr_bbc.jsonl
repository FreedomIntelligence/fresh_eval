Five of the six people on board the smaller aircraft died.\nThe flawless evacuation on the Japan Airlines jet has astounded the world and won praise from many. Aviation experts and flight crew tell the BBC it boiled down to the flight crew putting their rigorous training in place and \"well-behaved\" passengers who obeyed safety protocols.\n\"I don't see a single passenger on the ground, in any of the videos I've seen, that has got their luggage with them… If people tried to take their cabin luggage, that's really dangerous because they would slow down the evacuation,\" said Prof Ed Galea, director of the Fire Safety Engineering Group at the University of Greenwich.\nThe state of the aircraft, an Airbus A350, made the evacuation difficult, Prof Galea said.\n\"This accident was far from ideal. The aircraft was nose down, which meant it was difficult for passengers to move,\" he said.\nOnly three inflatable slides could be used to evacuate passengers but they were not properly deployed because of how the jet landed. The slide was very steep, which could have been dangerous.\nThe aircraft's announcement system also malfunctioned during the evacuation, so the flight crew had to convey instructions using a megaphone and by shouting, Japan Airlines said.\nOne passenger sustained bruises and 13 others requested medical consultations due to physical discomfort, the airline said.\nThe Japan Airlines jet departed from Sapporo's New Chitose airport at 16:00 local time (07:00 GMT) and landed at Haneda shortly before 18:00. The smaller coastguard aircraft was due to deliver aid to victims of a powerful New Year's Day earthquake. An investigation into the collision is under way.\nA former Japan Airlines flight attendant told the BBC that passengers on the commercial flight were \"incredibly fortunate\".\n\"I felt relieved to find out that all the passengers were safe. But when I started thinking about the emergency evacuation procedure, I suddenly felt nervous and fearful,\" she said. \"Depending on how the two planes collided and how the fire spread, it could have been a lot worse.\"\nIn real-life situations, it could be difficult to ensure that passengers do not panic, said the former flight attendant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\"But what they achieved is harder than one can imagine. The fact that they managed to get everyone to escape is a result of good co-ordination among crew and passengers following instructions,\" she said.\nShe said new crew members undergo stringent evacuation and rescue training for up to three weeks before they are allowed to serve in commercial flights. The training is repeated every year.\n\"We go through a written exam, case study discussions and practical training using different scenarios, such as when the plane has to make a water landing or if there is fire on board. Maintenance staff are also involved in such training,\" said the former flight attendant, who left the company 10 years ago.\nA pilot for a South East Asian airline, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the rigorous training that the flight crew had undergone helped with the speedy evacuation.\n\"I must say it was amazing. I think what happened in this case was that the training kicked in. You really don't have time to think in a situation like this, so you just do what you were trained to do,\" he said.\nIn order for any passenger aircraft to be internationally certified, aircraft manufacturers must show that everyone aboard can leave the plane within 90 seconds. Evacuation tests sometimes involve actual passengers, he added.\nThe pilot added that aviation safety regulations had been significantly strengthened after past mishaps.\nFor instance, the collision of two Boeing 747 jets at Los Rodeos Airport in Spain in 1977 - which killed 583 people and remains the deadliest accident in aviation history - led to a review of cockpit procedures and radio communications. The crash was found to be due to miscommunication between flight crew and air traffic controllers.\nJapan Airlines experienced its own catastrophe in August 1985, when Osaka-bound Flight 123 crashed into a mountain shortly after take-off from Tokyo Haneda. It was later attributed to faulty repair work by Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer. Only four out of 524 people on board initially survived the crash.\nIn 2006, Japan Airlines opened a museum-like facility near Haneda displaying wreckage from the incident, aimed at promoting safety awareness among its employees.\n\"In face of the pain and grief of the bereaved families and public distrust in airline safety [after the 1985 crash], we pledged that we would never again allow such a tragic accident to occur,\" Japan Airlines wrote on the facility's webpage.\n\"Every staff is reminded that valuable lives and property are entrusted to us in our work.\"\nAdditional reporting by Mariko Oi\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox."}

Zhuang's family eventually paid $80,000 (£62,600) to the perpetrators.\nExperts told the BBC that advancements in technology have made it easier for criminals to pursue cyber kidnapping schemes. While there is no clear data on the number of cases, they said, Zhuang's experience is not an isolated occurrence. \n\"The way it's being perpetrated in most cases, [it] could happen to anyone,\" said Joseph Steinberg, a cyber security expert who has advised business firms and governments. \"The crimes have gotten much more targeted and much more expensive.\"\nPolice believe kidnappers began manipulating the 17-year-old exchange student as early as 20 December, when he was seen with camping equipment in Utah.\nTypically, cyber kidnappings involve criminals calling or messaging a victim to trick them into thinking a loved one has been kidnapped, though the person is actually safe, Mr Steinberg said. \nVictims have reported hearing screaming on the phone while the perpetrator claimed their loved one was in danger to secure a ransom. \n\"They will do anything to keep you on the phone,\" said Marie-Helen Maras, the director of the Center for Cybercrime Studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \"They'll threaten to cause harm if you hang up or if you try to contact anyone to frighten their targets into making rushed decisions.\"\nThere have been several cases in which Chinese foreign exchange students in other countries - including Canada and Australia - were coerced into staging their own kidnappings to extort money from relatives, said Dr Maras, who has studied cyber kidnapping cases. \nNo data is available on the frequency of virtual kidnappings, which go largely unreported, experts said. They emphasised, however, that advances in technology have facilitated the crimes and made them easier to commit.  \nMr Steinberg said he worries about the use of artificial intelligence to impersonate loved ones' voices and coerce them into paying ransoms. \n\"The technology has reached a point where even loving parents who know their kids really well can be tricked,\" he said. \nSocial media also allows perpetrators to study and collect information on victims before they make contact, allowing them to gain valuable insight on an individual's life. \nCriminals \"can even spoof numbers to make it look like it's coming from you\", Dr Maras said. \"They are becoming increasingly better at obscuring the fraud.\" \nThe crimes seem to be leading to larger payouts now, too, said Mr Steinberg, who noted that perpetrators are rarely caught. \nIn the past, criminals targeted more vulnerable individuals - such as undocumented immigrants and non-native English speakers - for small sums, he said. \nBut in the case of Zhuang, officials said his parents paid a hefty ransom. \n\"Cyber crime is probably the crime that pays the best,\" Mr Steinberg said. \"You can target people in different languages. You can do it from anywhere.\"\nThough experts said that anyone can fall victim to virtual kidnappings, people can take several steps to better protect themselves. \nThe first is simply being aware of the problem, knowing what personal information is public and staying vigilant, Mr Steinberg said. \nBut those who are targeted should report it to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center first. \nAfter initially receiving an emergency call or message, Mr Steinberg also recommends trying to reach the loved one to verify their location. Families can also come up with specific phrases or keywords to use in emergency situations that perpetrators would not be aware of, he said.\nLaw enforcement agencies and telecommunications companies may play a role in preventing the crimes in the future as well by making improvements in authenticating and tracing the source of calls, Mr Steinberg said. \nWhile it remains unknown how many victims are out there, experts said these small steps could help keep people safe. \n\"The reality is that we know that people just like us… have fallen prey,\" Mr Steinberg said.

The tepid, bureaucratic answers by the panellists, including Dr Gay, on how to deal with calls for Jewish genocide prompted the resignation of University of Pennsylvania president Liz Magill.\nAfter that episode, Harvard offered continued support for Dr Gay's tenure as president. But the battle was not over.\nFor her right-wing critics, Dr Gay - who is black - represents much of what they loathe about modern American higher education, which they view as being dominated by a left-wing ideology that places a greater emphasis on ethnic and gender diversity than on academic rigour.\n\"It was a thinly veiled exercise in race and gender when they selected Claudine Gay,\" Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, a Harvard graduate, wrote on social media after she announced her resignation.\nNew York Times columnist Bret Stephens, noting the 53-year-old Dr Gay's relatively thin academic record that includes no published books and 11 journal articles, decried what he called the \"social justice model of higher education\".\nHe wrote that the \"intellectual rot\" in American higher education \"won't stop spreading until universities return to the idea that their central purpose is to identify and nurture and liberate the best minds, not to engineer social utopias\".\nThe plagiarism allegations that led to Dr Gay's resignation were surfaced by Christopher Rufo, a right-wing activist best known for the cultural battle over alleged teaching of Critical Race Theory in US schools.\nIn a December social media post, Mr Rufo laid out what is a now-familiar strategy for conservatives seeking to generate coverage of stories they believe the mainstream media are ignoring.\n\"We launched the Claudine Gay plagiarism story from the right,\" Mr Rufo wrote. \"The next step is to smuggle it into the media apparatus of the left, legitimizing the narrative to centre-left actors who have the power to topple her. Then squeeze.\"\nMr Rufo's efforts were amplified by media outlets that included the New York Post and the Washington Free Beacon, which on Monday published details of a new anonymous complaint filed with Harvard that included additional evidence of alleged plagiarism in Dr Gay's published work.\nIn her resignation letter, Dr Gay said she was \"subjected to personal attacks and threats fuelled by racial animus\", adding that the last few weeks had made clear that more must be done to \"combat bias and hate in all its forms\".\nIt was a sentiment echoed, with more focused anger, by others on the left.\n\"So what we've learned is this: Bad-faith bigots pretending they're concerned about antisemitism will happily use women of colour - especially black women - as a scapegoat and lightning rod for large systemic issues,\" wrote novelist Celeste Ng on social media. \"And that people invested in maintaining those systemic issues will comply.\"\nThe current Harvard controversy reached its culmination with Dr Gay's resignation, but the larger conservative effort to undermine - and ultimately supplant - liberal-dominated institutions of higher education continues.\nIn Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis - a current Republican presidential candidate - replaced the leadership of the New College of Florida, cancelling its diversity and inclusion programmes, firing faculty members and putting right-wing activists, including Mr Rufo, on its board trustees. His goal, in part, is to offer a conservative counterpoint to the modern liberal arts college.\nDonald Trump, as part of his \"Agenda 47\" plan for a second term in office, has called for changes in how US universities are accredited, to emphasise \"defending the American tradition and Western civilization\". He has also pledged to end equity programmes, force universities to reduce overhead costs and tax the endowments of schools that do not comply.\nHarvard may ultimately replace Dr Gay with someone who has a similar academic and political disposition, who continues to defend ways to make Harvard's student body diverse.\nBut by toppling the president of one of the nation's most prestigious universities - the one involved in the Supreme Court fight over racial preferences in admissions earlier this year - conservatives have a substantial victory on which to build."}

In August, a Russian rocket slammed to earth killing two young women as they sat on a bench in a playground, in the shadow of a church.\nTheir names were Kristina Spitsyna and Svitlana Siemieikina, and they are among the more than 10,000 civilians who have lost their lives since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.\nThe UN believes the actual number of men, women and children who have been killed is \"considerably higher\".\nRussia's war in Ukraine is now a constant. The horror has become familiar. Many deaths are not reported in detail, but we wanted to tell the story of the lives, and last moments, of just two of those killed.\nWhen the breeze whispers in the trees, Halyna Spitsyna feels it is the presence of her daughter, Kristina. \"The wind blows, and you think this is the soul of your child, hugging you,\" she says.\nThen she bends to put yellow chrysanthemums in a vase on Kristina's grave.\nHer daughter - a promising young singer - took her last breath in August, together with her best friend Svitlana. They are buried side by side at the edge of an overgrown cemetery.\nThe twin graves are a blaze of colour, stacked with wreaths, and topped with blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flags. The graves stand out - as if calling attention to the youth and talent that have been taken.\nKristina and Svitlana came together in wartime, bonding over a love of music and a love of Ukraine. They formed a duo called Similar Girls. They sang at weddings, and live-streamed street concerts to their Telegram channel, raising money for soldiers and civilians alike.\nOn 9 August they were singing outside a supermarket on a busy street in their hometown of Zaporizhzhia - Svitlana, 18, on guitar, and Kristina, 21, on vocals.\nTheir performance was recorded on a phone. It is haunting to watch.\nThe footage shows Kristina, with long blond hair, wearing shorts, and Svitlana, guitar in hand, in jeans. They are brimming with life.\n\"Our last song will be for all people and the defenders of Kherson,\" says Kristina. She chooses a well-known Ukrainian song called Winning The War. Her voice soars across the evening air.\nUnder the blue sky in the rays of truth\nWith the yellow sun on my shoulder\nWe write books for the future\nHow we will win the war\nHow we win the war\nThat song became their requiem. Twenty minutes later both girls were killed in the playground around the corner where they had gone to take a rest. It was a 300m walk from the main street.\nHalyna is tormented by profound loss and agonising questions - what if the girls had not gone to the playground? What if they had stayed on the street?\nAnd how can she carry on living now?\n\"You don't know what plans to make for tomorrow,\" she says, her face wet with tears. \"Sometimes you can smile, but then you remember that she can't smile any more. It is as if you are dead, but you can speak.\"\nThen, the youthful looking 43-year-old sales manager apologises for being overcome.\nThe rocket attack that killed the girls echoed through the city. Svitlana's father, Yurii Siemieikin, heard it at his home on the outskirts, and jumped straight into his car.\n\"I knew they were somewhere in that district. The police let me through, and I saw what I saw. Svitlana was lying in front of me,\" he says, gesturing to the ground with his hands, as his words fall away.\nHe sits in the shade of a chestnut tree, his wife Anna and their 12-year-old daughter, Sasha, by his side. The family's secluded garden is a universe of grief.\n\"How is it possible in the 21st Century, to do something like this, completely unprovoked?\" asks Yurii, 41, who works on the railways.\nThe Russians, he says, will never be forgiven. \"This will last for generations to come. Our great-grandchildren will remember all they have done here and are continuing to do,\" he says. Yurii speaks slowly, in a low voice, as if holding in his grief is taking every ounce of energy.\nSvitlana was musical from childhood, he says, and wrote her own songs. She loved K-pop and studied foreign languages. Inside the family's modest house her bedroom is just as she left it - with her posters of Nirvana and AC/DC on the wall. Her guitar is still on the bed, as if she might one day return. Now it is Sasha's turn to play it.\n\"She taught me how,\" Sasha says. \"At first it was hard, and I didn't like it. Now I want to keep playing. She wanted everyone to be happy and without war. She wanted to do what she could with her music.\"\nSasha speaks calmly of missiles and air raids - now staples of a Ukrainian childhood. The killing of her sister has changed her calculation of risk, in an unexpected way.\n\"I started paying less attention to the danger,\" she says matter-of-factly. \"I live in my own world. I feel safer now because I feel that Sveta [Svitlana] is always with me.\"\nA framed photo of Svitlana is attached to the cross on her grave, Kristina's photo is alongside, on her grave. In the photos they are looking towards each other, both forever young.\nUkraine is losing some of its brightest and its best, on and off the battlefield. The dead include actors and artists, ballet dancers and sports stars, and voices of the future like Kristina and Svitlana.\nWhen the war broke out, Halyna suggested that the girls should leave. They refused. She says they wanted to keep singing, to lift people's spirits. Halyna grieves not just for her loss, but for what her country is losing every day.\n\"Young people are dying who are very talented and very ambitious. If we don't have children, what future does the country have. It doesn't just impact us,\" she says. \"It can destroy Ukraine.\"\nHalyna says that when Kristina started performing - at the age of five - \"she came on to the scene as a star. She had no fear of the stage. For her, it was vital to sing.\"\nShe imagined her daughter would be famous for her voice, not for her death.\nInstead, she and Svitlana - and many more - are filling early graves.\nHey, listen, Mum.\nI'm going off to war.\nDon't you cry\nI'll come back alive.\nAdditional reporting by Wietske Burema and Natalka Sosnytska"}

I am just about to release,\" Mr Menendez allegedly texted Mr Daibes in August 2021, referring to a press release that contained favourable comments about Qatar. \nAbout a month later, the senator and Mr Daibes attended an event in New York hosted by the Qatari government. \nDays later, the indictment says, Mr Daibes sent the senator photographs of watches ranging in price from $9,990 to $23,990 (£7,900 to £19,000), asking Menendez: \"How about one of these?\"\nIn 2022, ahead of the meeting with Mr Daibes and the Qatari investor in London, Mr Menendez allegedly texted both of them: \"Greetings, I understand my friend is going to visit with you on the 15th of the month. \n\"I hope that this will result in the favorable and mutually beneficial agreement that you have both engaged in discussing.\"\nAmong the benefits Mr Menendez received from the Qataris, the indictment alleges, were tickets to a Formula One Grand Prix race in Miami, Florida.\nIt also claims that one day after returning from a trip to Qatar and Egypt and being picked up at the airport by Mr Daibes driver, the senator performed a web search for \"how much is one kilo of gold worth\".\nA search of the Menendez house in June 2022 discovered, among other things, two one-kilo gold bars that the government says were provided as part of the bribery plot. \nAgents also discovered hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash that bore Mr Daibes' fingerprints and DNA.\nAdam Fee, a lawyer for Mr Menendez said in a statement, \"the government's new allegations stink of desperation\".\nHe said the prosecutors' claims are all \"based on routine, lawful contacts between a Senator and his constituents or foreign officials\".\n\"At all times, Senator Menendez acted entirely appropriately with respect to Qatar, Egypt, and the many other countries he routinely interacts with,\" the lawyer added."}

A group of current and former state lawmakers challenged Mr Trump's place on the ballot, which Maine law required Ms Bellows to rule on.\nSeveral lawsuits in other states - such as Michigan and Minnesota - that are similar to the Maine objection have been rejected in court.\nThe US Supreme Court is expected to take up the issue raised in Maine and Colorado, which will not take effect until the legal challenges are settled. A ruling by the court on Mr Trump's eligibility would be applied nationwide.\nDavid Janovksy, a senior policy analyst at the Project on Government Oversight, an independent watchdog, said that \"whichever way the Supreme Court rules is the best outcome\".\n\"The fact that we now have two states in Colorado and Maine that have made this determination against the backdrop of other states that have declined to go that far means that if there was ever a case for the Supreme Court to resolve, this would be it,\" he said.\n\"Time is of the essence now that we're in an election year,\" Mr Janovsky added\nIn an interview with the BBC last week, Ms Bellows defended her actions and said she hoped that the matter would ultimately be settled by the Supreme Court.\nShe said that she was \"mindful\" that no other secretary of state in US history had removed a presidential candidate due to the insurrection clause.\n\"But I'm also mindful that no presidential candidate has, ever before, engaged in insurrection,\" Ms Bellows said.\nShe also denied that her decision was in any way politically motivated, instead arguing that it was \"thorough and based on the rule of law\".\nBoth Mr Trump and his campaign have repeatedly decried the rulings from Maine and Colorado as politically motivated and intended to harm his chances of winning the 2024 election.\nIn addition to the legal wrangling over his eligibility in the election, Mr Trump is facing trials in federal court and in Georgia stemming from his attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.\nHe has not been charged with inciting insurrection in either of the two cases.\nIn a separate case on Tuesday, a federal judge in Washington DC ruled that part of a lawsuit against Mr Trump stemming from the death of a police officer at the 6 January riot can go ahead.\nIn the lawsuit, Sandra Garza - the wife of Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick - sued Mr Trump and two participants in the riot over his death."}

Was the cemetery used over a long period of time as burial practices were changing? Or were some people being marked out as different?\nThe items being found around the graves are also surprising and they show how life in the middle of the first millennium was very different from now.\nFragments of dishes and cups have been found, and splinters of animal bone that have been butchered and burnt. One item really brings this community to life: a tiny carved peg that may have been used as a marker for scoring in a game, perhaps something like we use in a cribbage board.\nDr Andy Seaman, a specialist in early medieval archaeology from the University of Cardiff - who is leading the digging team - says unlike cemeteries now, this doesn't seem to be just a place to dispose of the dead.\n\"We tend to think of graveyards as sort of enclosed spaces that we don't really go to, but they probably would have been quite central to life in the past,\" he explained.\n\"And it's not just a place for people being buried, but it's a place where communities are coming together: they are burying their dead, but they're also undertaking other forms of activity, and social practice, including eating and drinking - and feasting\"\nMost perplexing though is that the artefacts being discovered here suggest these people were far from ordinary.\nWhile we're at the dig, an excited shout goes up: \"I've just found a piece of glass.\"\nIt's lying in one of the graves.\n\"It's a rim shard, an ice-cream shaped cone vessel - very fine material, very fine glass… it's a really nice find,\" Andy Seaman says as he admires the fragment.\nHe thinks it's from the Bordeaux region in France - and it's not the only imported item, the team has also found pieces of pottery, possibly from North Africa.\nThe quality of these finds suggests that the people there were of a high status.\nTudur Davies, from the University of Cardiff, says: \"The evidence we've got here is that the people have access to very high quality imported goods, that you can only get through trading or exchange networks, with people with a lot of wealth, to bring it here.\n\"What exactly is going on? Who are these people being buried here?\"\nFurther research is needed to get a more precise date for when the graveyard was in use, and DNA analysis will reveal more about the skeletons buried there.\nThe cemetery will provide a snapshot in time of both each individual and the community as a whole helping to shed more light on an era that we still know very little about.\nBut the questions about who actually lived and died here may take a lot longer to answer.\nFollow Rebecca on X, formerly known as Twitter.\nYou can see more on the medieval cemetery on Digging for Britain on BBC 2 at 8pm on 4 January.

We have received a lot of information about people in need of rescue and there are people waiting for help,\" Mr Kishida said Wednesday after an emergency task force meeting.\nHe also said some 3,000 rescuers were trying to reach parts of the Noto peninsula. Helicopter surveys showed many fires and widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure. The city of Wajima, on the northern tip of Noto, has been cut off from land routes. \nIn the coastal city of Suzu in Ishikawa prefecture, some 90% of homes in the city had been \"completely or nearly completely destroyed\", mayor Masushiro Izumiya told news outlet Kyodo. \nThe Japanese military has been handing out supplies including food, water and blankets for those who have had to vacate their homes. The country's government has said that 57,360 people had to be evacuated. \nTens of thousands of meals are being delivered across the affected region.\nAftershocks continued into Wednesday. The chief cabinet secretary, Yoshimasa Hayashi, warned people to \"be alert\" for more earthquakes \"of an intensity of up to 7\" in the coming week. \nIshikawa, 155km (96.3 miles) south of the Noto peninsula, experienced a 5.5 quake on Wednesday morning.\nThe major tsunami warnings put out by the Japanese government on Monday were later downgraded. By Tuesday, all tsunami advisories were lifted along the Sea of Japan, meaning there was no longer a risk of giant waves.\nResidents of the affected area of Japan have been sharing their experiences of the quake, which lasted several minutes. \nAn 82-year-old resident of Nanao, Toshio Iwahama, told the BBC that his wooden home had partially collapsed. He said that despite living through multiple earthquakes, he had never experienced tremors of this magnitude.\nBriton Emma Ward, 41, who was on a skiing holiday in the resort village of Hakuba, said the quake had hit \"without warning\", prompting her group to take shelter under a table in a cafe. She told the BBC that the intensity of the tremors had caused people to flee the building entirely. \"The worst part during the earthquake was not knowing how intense it was going to become. It's a very frightening experience,\" Ms Ward said.\nMany also said the quake had reminded them of the devastating 2011 earthquake and tsunami that killed 18,000 people and triggered an accident at a nuclear plant in Fukushima.\nIn an incident unrelated to the earthquake, a Japan Airlines plane caught fire on Tuesday as it collided with a coastguard aircraft on its way to provide earthquake relief at Tokyo's Haneda airport.\nFive people on board the coastguard plane are known to have died, but the Japan Airlines plane's 379 passengers and crew managed to escape.\nJapan is one of the most seismically active nations on Earth, owing to its location on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, where many tectonic plates meet. \nThe constant threat of earthquakes has led Japan to develop one of the world's most sophisticated tsunami warning systems."}

Such powers cannot be exercised in the absence of cogent justifications,\" he said.\nHe also rejected the argument that there was a conflict of interest among members of the court-appointed panel and added that newspaper reports and investigations by third-party organisations cannot be held as conclusive evidence to question Sebi's findings.\nIn its report, Hindenburg - which specialises in \"short-selling\", or betting against a company's share price in the expectation that it will fall - accused Mr Adani of \"pulling the largest con in corporate history\". \nThe report questioned the Adani Group's ownership of companies in offshore tax havens such as Mauritius and the Caribbean. \nIt also claimed Adani companies had \"substantial debt\" which put the entire group on a \"precarious financial footing\".\nThe Adani Group denied the allegations, calling the report \"malicious\" and said that it had always been \"in compliance with all laws\".\nThe allegations triggered a meltdown in Indian markets as the Adani Group's companies saw more than $100bn (£82bn) wiped off their market value in the weeks after the report was made public.\nHowever, their stocks have since bounced back and saw a jump in price in the hours before Wednesday's verdict.\nMr Adani is among the richest people in the world and is perceived as being close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

But she later complained of being pressured by officials of the Spanish football federation to put her name to the statement.\nMr Rubiales is being investigated for possible coercion over his role in the alleged pressure on Ms Hermoso.\nJorge Vilda, the coach who led the team to World Cup glory before being sacked shortly afterwards, is also being investigated along with Albert Luque and Rubén Rivera, both federation executives.\nMs Hermoso said she did not want to be kissed and that she felt that she had been a \"victim of assault\". Under Spanish law a kiss without consent can be deemed a form of sexual assault.\nMr Rubiales has always maintained the kiss was a \"consensual peck\" but in the wake of the incident he was forced to resign as president of the Spanish football federation.\nProsecutors opened an investigation and last September he was barred by investigating judge Francisco de Jorge from going within 200m (650ft) of the footballer.\nIn a statement to prosecutors leaked to Spanish TV in October, Ms Hermoso said that \"clearly I felt disrespected\" as a player and a person.\n\"I didn't do anything to land myself in that situation... how could I expect it in that scenario of a medal ceremony at a World Cup final?\"\nMs Hermoso, 33, announced on Monday that she was changing clubs.

The mouse is out,\" the trailer screams in red text.\n\"People need to not take it too seriously, we made a ridiculously fun movie,\" said Simon Phillips, who wrote and produce the film and plays the man behind the Mickey mask.\nMr Phillips told the BBC that \"if you put Mickey into a family movie, you don't cover new ground\".\n\"In order to flip the coin, you have to come up with something that's the polar opposite of what already exists,\" he said.\nThe film itself does not have a confirmed release date but is expected to be out this March.\nNot to be outdone, a new video game has been unveiled, also featuring the 1928 version of Mickey.\nGame studio Nightmare Forge Games said the game, titled Infestation 88, is a survival horror game in which an outbreak of vermin turns into something more sinister.\nAt the start of the trailer, a man is heard saying nervously: \"I thought it was just rodents, but there's something else in here.\"\nA huge, blood splattered Mickey then pops up on screen, while mice scurry around him.\nA spokesperson from Nightmare Forge Games told the BBC that Steamboat Willie entering the public domain \"allowed us to include our own derivation of the film's starring character in our game, which fits perfectly as an antagonist causing an infestation\".\nMickey's not the first childhood character to be given the horror movie treatment.\nWhen Winnie the Pooh entered the public domain, the loveable bear was turned into the R-rated horror film Blood and Honey, which was one of last year's worst-rated films.\nUS copyright law says the rights to characters can be held for 95 years, which means the characters in Steamboat Willie entered the public domain on 1 January 2024.\nDisney has faced losing the copyright over its original cartoons several times in the past.\nThe characters were first expected to go into the public domain in 1984, but Congress extended the term by 20 years.\nBefore the next expiry date came up in 2004, another 20-year extension was passed.\nDisney's efforts to protect its characters have even led to the law being dubbed \"the Mickey Mouse Protection Act\". But the moment finally came, and was hailed as being \"deeply symbolic\" by experts.\nThe company still separately holds a trademark on Mickey as a brand identifier and a corporate mascot. That means there are still limits on how the public can use these images.\nAnd Disney has insisted that more modern versions of Mickey are still covered by copyright.\n\"We will, of course, continue to protect our rights in the more modern versions of Mickey Mouse and other works that remain subject to copyright,\" the company said."}

But last summer, she had a mainstream breakthrough with the pinging, percussive pop banger It Goes Like (Nanana).\n\"Even though I've been releasing music since 2015, last year really hit differently,\" she says. \n\"I did not expect this song was going to get so much love, but it really changed a lot of things for me.\"\nSince the song hit the charts, she's graced the cover of Vogue magazine, been named the best house DJ in the world and linked up with Lenny Kravitz,\nOn top of that, she's just been voted into third place on BBC Radio 1's Sound Of 2024, which aims to predict the biggest crossover stars of the next 12 months.\n\"I can't believe it,\" she says on a Zoom call from Dubai. \"I want to say thanks to everyone who voted for me!\"\nIn some respects, her place on the list is a surprise. Since it started in 2003, the Sound Of poll has championed newcomers - from the initial winner, 50 Cent, to the likes of Franz Ferdinand, Adele, James Blake, Stormzy and PinkPantheress.\nNo other nominee has ever been eight years into their career, but there's a sense that Gou's poised to break out of the dance bubble.\nIt's a change she's noticed herself. \"Before, people knew about me before they knew my music. But after Nanana, I felt like people heard the music without knowing what I even look like. That's the big difference.\"\nThe music speaks for itself. Bright, melodic and danceable, it has obvious mass appeal. \nIn the words of legendary producer Todd Terry, her interpretation of house is not just a style of music but a feeling in itself.\n\"I want to give people a really good energy,\" she says. \"After 50 years, I want people to say, 'Do you remember that song? Do you remember that moment?' and talk about the memories and the feelings they had when they heard it for the first time.\"\nPeggy Gou was born Kim Min-ji in 1991, and raised in South Korea's chief seaport, Incheon. \nThe first music she loved was K-pop - not the modern, mechanical sounds of Stray Kids or BTS, but the 80s idols like Kim Wan-sun and Uhm Jung-hwa (aka \"the Korean Madonna\").\n\"If I listen back to it now, it's still good,\" she says. \"It has a sexy feeling and a happy feeling to it.\"\nBut her real musical education began when she turned 14 and her parents sent her to London to study English.\n\"It was quite a brave thing to do, if I think about it. I didn't speak any English. I used to carry dictionaries around with me all the time.\"\nAs a minor, she spent three years living with guardians, but she took a casual approach to the rules - obtaining a fake ID and spending her weekends clubbing around the capital. \n\"I don't know if you know Croydon, but I lived in Croydon,\" she laughs. \"I was a little savage ghetto girl!\"\nShe moved back to Korea when she was 18, but instantly found home to be stifling. Within six months, she'd enrolled in the London College of Fashion and returned to the UK.\n\"I couldn't keep up with the studying in Korea, if I'm honest,\" she says, \"but I also felt like I belonged [in the UK]. \n\"I was more open-minded and Korea at that time, for me, it was too conservative.\"\nStudying took second place to nightlife. She went out dancing six times a week, at hip-hop nights and underground clubs. In 2011, she discovered deep house and fell in love with its vibey, R&B-infused sound.\nBy that point, she'd already learned the basics of beat-matching from a friend, and when the DJ pulled out of a Korean society event at her university, Gou offered to step in.\n\"I messed up a lot of things in that show, but I still made people dance. \n\"I was like, 'Wow, this is amazing. I love this feeling.'\"\nWord began to spread. Gou was booked to play at other University events, then scored a weekly residency at east London's Book Club.\nUnsurprisingly, she failed her fashion course, but she picked up work at Harper's Bazaar and, in 2016, moved to Germany.\nThere she had one aim: To be the first Korean woman to play Berghain, Berlin's most exclusive nightclub. \nWithin a year, she'd achieved it.\nBy that point, Gou was dropping original songs into her DJ sets - but only after four years of writing and rejecting her own material.\nHer first demos were \"70% samples\", she says, mixing club beats with traditional Korean instruments, but \"every song sounded the same\" (for completists, she later released one of those early tracks, Hungboo, on her DJ-Kicks compilation). \nIn 2016, she released four EPs of supple-but-lethal house tunes. But it was only when she went for a more stripped-back, vocal-led approach that things started to come together.\nHer calling card was It Makes You Forget (Itgehane), the sound of sunrise set to music - all swirling synths and gently bubbling acid bass, over a skipping house beat. \nAn ode to club culture and the restorative power of escapism, it also marked Gou's first attempt at singing.\n\"That was my brave challenge. I was singing in Korean, which I thought wasn't such a cool thing in the beginning,\" she says. \n\"I did try it in English and Spanish, also. But then I was like, 'You know what, I'm Korean. I should sing in Korean!'\"\nFor Westerners used to the staccato, rap-infused cadences of K-Pop, Gou's diaphanous vocals may come as a surprise, but she explains the Korean language has many colours.\n\"With K-pop, as soon as it's out, it has to hit number one - meaning it's all about how addictive the song is, how catchy it is. \n\"In my songs the lyrics are very poetic, so I care about how the words sound. Does the line finish with an \"ay,\" an \"ah\", or an \"oh\"? \n\"My vocal trainer always says I have a breathy voice, so the way I sing is not so staccato.\"\nIt Makes You Forget (Itgehane) became a huge anthem in the summer of 2018; and Gou's schedule grew even busier, with gigs in Brazil, Australia, Italy, Paris, France and Japan.\nBut it was a set at Glastonbury that really stood out.\n\"I didn't even know what Glastonbury was, I was so naive,\" she says. \n\"But when I started playing, people took their shoes off, held them in the air and started shouting, 'Peggy Who? Peggy Shoe!'\"\n\"I still don't really know why - but in Australia, when people take their shoes off, it means you're playing a banger.\"\nThe success was thrilling and welcome, but the demanding lifestyle of an international DJ began to take its toll.\nWhen she travels, Gou takes notes of how she feels as a sort of aide-memoire. But in 2019, after catching a glimpse of herself in the mirror of an airport toilet, she simply wrote: \"I look exhausted\".\nIt was only when Covid hit that she had time to pause. \n\"I had to stop because there were no shows,\" she says, \"and I spent a lot of that time digging out 90s music and 80s music. \n\"I don't know why but music from that period really encouraged me during that difficult time. Simple, catchy, classy, repetitive but never boring.\"\nInspired, she spun her exhausted-in-an-airport story into a song, using the uplifting innocence of 90s dance music to give her motivation when life seemed overwhelming.\n\"'I Go' is such a great phrase because, obviously, it means 'I'll keep moving' in English, but it's also a sound that older people in Korea make whenever they're suffering from pain or they're tired.\n\"I thought it was perfect. I like to find the word in Korean that makes sense in English, too.\"\nUnsurprisingly, Gou admits to being a perfectionist. She won't release a song until she's 100% happy - which is perhaps why it's taken eight years for her to prepare her debut album.\nScheduled for release this year, it will feature It Goes Like (Nanana) and her current single, I Believe In Love Again - a collaboration with Lenny Kravitz.\nThe rest of her album, including the title, is currently under wraps, but Gou promises \"it's not just dance music\".\n\"You can expect certain things that are different than I've ever done\".\nAnd as she takes centre stage, she hints that her in-demand DJ sets might soon be accompanied by more traditional concert performances.\n\"Why not?\" she smiles cryptically. \"I think that's everyone's dream.\""}

Experts say a flawless evacuation and new technology played a large part in their survival.\nThose on board the second plane, a smaller coastguard aircraft due to deliver aid to quake victims, were not as fortunate. Five were killed and the pilot is seriously injured.\nInvestigators are piecing together what happened at 17:47 local time (08:47 GMT) at Haneda airport, and why two planes could have been on the runway at the same time.\nFor now, videos and statements from passengers paint a picture of a few minutes of terror, then disbelief at what they had lived through.\nSwede Anton Deibe, 17, a passenger, described the chaos after impact as the Airbus A350 lumbered to a halt on the runway.\n\"The entire cabin was filled with smoke within minutes,\" he told the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet.\n\"The smoke in the cabin stung like hell. It was a hell.\n\"We threw ourselves down on the floor. Then the emergency doors were opened and we threw ourselves at them.\n\"We had no idea where we were going so we just run out into the field. It was chaos.\"\nHe, his parents and his sister managed to escape the wreckage unharmed.\nSatoshi Yamake, a 59-year-old passenger, said he felt the airplane had \"tilted to the side and felt a big bump\" in the initial collision.\nAnother unnamed passenger described a \"bump, like the aircraft was colliding with something when touching down. I saw a spark outside the window and the cabin was filled with smoke\".\nA third reported to Kyodo News he felt \"a boom like we had hit something and jerked upward the moment we landed\".\nSnippets of those moments were caught on phones.\nSome passengers filmed the red glow from a still sparking engine as the plane came to a halt.

So everyone disembarked from the front,\" he said.\nImages and video show the moment people began to jump down the airliner's inflatable slides - some tumbling in their effort to get away from a now burning cabin, and running to greater safety.\nNo one appears to be holding their bulky carry-on luggage - a major factor in how quickly a cabin can be cleared.\nAlex Macheras, an aviation analyst, told the BBC that the crew \"were able to initiate a textbook evacuation\" in the crucial first few minutes after impact.\nThe fire was \"isolated to one area\" of the Airbus A350 for the initial 90 seconds, allowing them a brief window to get everyone out.\nHe said the crew were clearly able to understand which doors were away from the flames, which is why pictures show not all the exits were opened for people to escape through.\nHe added that passengers can slow things down in panic - for example by trying to grab their bags from lockers.\nThe Airbus A350 is one of the first commercial jets to be made of composite, carbon-fibre materials - which appear to have stood up well to the initial collision and the resulting fire.\nAll of this was achieved as the fire was quickly spreading to engulf the plane. Video footage showed firefighters battling to contain the blaze, as the plane's fuselage began to break in two.\nMr Yamake, the passenger, said for all of the chaos, it took about five minutes for everyone to get out. \"I saw that the fire had spread in about 10, 15 minutes,\" he added.\nTsubasa Sawada, 28, said he could \"only say it was a miracle, we could have died\".\nIt took several hours for the fire to finally be extinguished. Fourteen passengers and crew were treated for minor injuries.\nPassengers were already trying to come to terms with that they had just lived through, telling their friends and loved ones that they were okay, and preparing for what was to come.\nMr Sawada had one question. \"I want to know why this happened,\" he said, adding that he did not plan to get on another plane until he got the answer."}

In 2003, the figure was 51.\nMusic writer Patrick Clifton recently identified that statistics like these added up to a \"crisis\" for the British music industry.\n\"A new generation of artists is not building fanbases that will buy gig and festival tickets in two, five, or 10-years' time, and is not popularising songs that will have ubiquity in our culture once this generation of music fans reaches old age,\" he wrote on Medium.\nThe artists who succeed, he argued, are those who are able to cultivate a \"two-way\" relationship with fans on social media, and \"don't mind revisiting songs from their repertoire if those songs blow up\".\nThe year-end charts partially reflect this shift, with artists like PinkPantheress and David Kushner translating viral success into real-world achievements.\nMeanwhile, superstars like Miguel and The Weeknd took overlooked album tracks into the charts for the first time after they resurfaced on TiKTok.\nThe so-called \"long tail\" effect also means that older songs will continue to generate streams after their initial chart run.\nTo that effect, nine hits from 2022 racked up their millionth \"sale\" in 2023, including Eliza Rose's dance anthem BOTA (Baddest Of Them All), George Ezra's Green, Green Grass and Sam Smith's duet with Kim Petras, Unholy.\nOne interesting side-effect of the shift in music habits is that the vinyl charts - once the preserve of collectible classics - now seem more up-to-date than the main album countdown.\nSeven of the top 10 vinyl albums were new releases. Taylor Swift's 1989 was the best-seller, followed by The Rolling Stones' critically-acclaimed comeback Hackney Diamonds. \nNew music from Olivia Rodrigo, Blur and Lewis Capaldi also made the top 10, alongside the perennial best-sellers Rumours, by Fleetwood Mac, and The Dark Side Of The Moon, by Pink Floyd.\nOverall, demand for music continued to grow, with a record 179.6 billion songs streamed in the UK.\nMore than 6 million vinyl records were sold, the highest total since 1990. Ten million albums were sold on CD, and cassette sales topped 100,000 for a fourth consecutive year.\nBut streaming dominates the UK's music habits, now accounting for 87.7% of the market, compared to 63.6% five years ago.\nThe BPI said 2023 was a \"landmark\" year for women, with seven of the top 10 best-selling songs featuring female acts.\n\"This should be celebrated, but without complacency,\" said Jo Twist, the organisation's chief executive. \n\"Our work in the music industry continues to ensure that this becomes the norm.\" "}

That's why it can make such precise measurements. \nThere's a network of GPS stations dotted at strategic points right across the country. When an earthquake strikes, scientists can tell exactly how much each one has moved, showing how the landscape has buckled and shifted.\nThis system shows that the land moved as much as 130cm to the west after the earthquake on Monday. \nMeanwhile, scientists have also been keeping an eye on Japan from space, comparing satellite images taken before and after the earthquake. \nOn its latest pass, the ALOS-2 spacecraft reported that the distance between itself and the ground had shortened as the Earth's surface had risen up under the force of the tremor. \nThe ground moved the most on the western side of the Noto peninsula. The ocean floor shifted off the coast there, generating tsunami waves of about 80cm in height. \nFortuitously, the uplift may actually have lessened the impact of the waves when they arrived at the shoreline.\nAny death is one too many, but it is remarkable just how few have occurred, even as searches continue for those still trapped in the rubble. The loss and damage models have been predicting an eventual toll of, at most, a hundred or so.\nIt's worth comparing this event with last year's M7.8 quake in Turkey. The two were broadly similar in terms of the energy released, but the death toll in Turkey and Syria rose to 50,000 and more. Go back to 2010 and the M7 quake in Haiti. More than 100,000 people died in that horrific event.\nThe explanation of the difference is simple: preparedness.\nJapan sits at the confluence of four major tectonic plates. It is one of the most seismically active areas on Earth; the country accounts for about 20% of global quakes of Magnitude 6.0 or greater, with seismometers recording some kind of event every five minutes on average. Japan has therefore invested greatly in making its infrastructure and its population resilient.\nThe building codes - the rules that guide construction - are strictly enforced; and citizens are well trained in how to respond to tremors. Japan also has one of the most advanced early warning systems in the world.\nScientists cannot predict the timing and scale of an event, but once under way instruments will trigger notifications to TV, radio and cell networks. These warnings will arrive for some people distant from the epicentre perhaps 10 to 20 seconds before the onset of the most severe shaking.\nThat might not sound like a lot of time, but it's sufficient notice to open the door at the local fire station, to apply the brakes on a high-speed train, and for everyone to \"drop, cover and hold on\".

They asked her to step down and allow the polls to be held under a neutral interim government - demands she rejected. \nThe Muslim-majority nation of about 170 million people, Bangladesh is almost surrounded on three sides - barring a 271km (168-mile)-long border with Myanmar in the southeast - by India. \nFor India, Bangladesh is not just a neighbouring country. It's a strategic partner and a close ally, crucial to the security of its north-eastern states. \nSo, Indian policy makers argue that Delhi needs a friendly regime in Dhaka. Ms Hasina has forged close ties with India since she was first elected in 1996 and it's no secret that Delhi wants to see her return to power. \nMs Hasina has always justified Dhaka's close relationship with Delhi. During a visit to India in 2022, she said Bangladesh should not forget India, its government, people and armed forces as they stood beside the country during the independence war in 1971.\nThis backing for her Awami League party has triggered sharp criticism from the opposition BNP.\n\"India should support the people of Bangladesh and not a particular party. Unfortunately, Indian policy makers don't want democracy in Bangladesh,\" Ruhul Kabir Rizvi, a senior BNP leader told the BBC.\nMr Rizvi said Delhi was \"alienating the people of Bangladesh\" by openly rooting for Ms Hasina and backing what he called a \"dummy election\".\nAn Indian foreign ministry spokesperson refused to comment on the BNP's allegations on Delhi's alleged interference in Bangladesh polls.\n\"Elections are a domestic matter to Bangladesh. It's for the people of Bangladesh to decide their own future. As a close friend and partner of Bangladesh we would like to see peaceful elections there,\" the spokesperson said in response to a question by the BBC.\nIndia is also concerned that the return of BNP and the Jamaat-e-Islami party could pave the way for the return of Islamists in Bangladesh, as it had happened when the coalition was in power between 2001 and 2006.\n\"They gave rise to so many of these jihadi groups which were used for various purposes, including the 2004 assassination attempt on Ms Hasina and the capture of 10 trucks full of arms that came from Pakistan,\" Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty, a former Indian High Commissioner in Dhaka told the BBC.\nSoon after coming to power in 2009, Ms Hasina also won favour with Delhi after acting against ethnic insurgent groups of India's northeast, some of which were operating from Bangladesh. \nIndia and Bangladesh share close cultural, ethnic and linguistic ties. Delhi played a key role in Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan in 1971 by sending in troops in support of the Bengali Resistance Force.\nDhaka depends on Delhi for the supply of many essential commodities like rice, pulses and vegetables. So, India is influential in Bangladesh from the kitchen to the ballot. \nIndia has also offered more than $7bn Line of Credit to Bangladesh since 2010 for infrastructure and development projects.\nBut over the decades, there have been irritants in relations ranging from disputes over sharing of water resources to accusations of meddling in each other's internal affairs. \n\"India has an image problem in Bangladesh. It comes from the perception that Bangladesh is not getting the best of the good neighbour, whether it comes to Delhi's support for the government that possibly doesn't enjoy full democratic legitimacy or in deals where we seek equitable share,\" Debapriya Bhattacharya, distinguished fellow at the Centre for Policy Dialogue in Dhaka, told the BBC. \nMs Hasina came to power for a second time in January 2009 and her party has since won two more elections, although there have been accusations of widespread vote-rigging. The Awami League has denied the allegations.\nThough India has gained road, river and train access via Bangladesh to transport goods to its north-eastern states, critics say Dhaka is still not able to do full-fledged overland trade with landlocked Nepal and Bhutan across the Indian territory.\nIndia also has other strategic reasons to have a friendly government in Dhaka.\nDelhi wants road and river transport access for its seven north-eastern states through Bangladesh.\nNow the road and train connectivity from the Indian mainland to its northeast is through the \"chicken's neck\" - a 20km (12 mile) land corridor that runs between Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan. Officials in Delhi are afraid this stretch is strategically vulnerable in any potential conflict with India's rival, China.\nWhile several Western governments had wanted to impose additional sanctions on Bangladeshi officials over alleged human rights violations and extra-judicial killings, India has been resisting the move calling it counterproductive. More so, since Beijing is keen to extend its footprint in Bangladesh as it battles for regional supremacy with India.\n\"We have conveyed to the West that if you push Ms Hasina, she will go into the Chinese camp, like other countries have done. That will cause a strategic problem with India,\" the former Indian diplomat, Mr Chakravarty, said. \"We can't afford that,\" he added.\nDespite close ties between the two governments there is suspicion among some Bangladeshis when it comes to India.\n\"I don't think Indians are friendly in all the areas. We are always having a problem with India as we are a Muslim nation,\" Zamiruddin, a vegetable merchant in Dhaka, said.\n\"We will have to safeguard ourselves first and then rely on others. Otherwise, we will be in trouble,\" he added.\nWhile Delhi is concerned about the possibility of an Islamist regrouping, many in Bangladesh are worried about what's happening across the border. \nRights groups say since the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in 2014 in India, discrimination against religious minorities, particularly Muslims, has increased - an allegation the BJP denies. \nIndian politicians also talk about alleged infiltration by \"Bangladeshi illegal immigrants' - seen as a part reference to Bengali Muslims who live in states like Assam and West Bengal.\n\"The maltreatment of Indian Muslims creates high potential possibility of maltreatment of the Hindu minorities in Bangladesh,\" Mr Bhattacharya said.\nHindus constitute nearly 8% of Bangladesh's population.\nDelhi is clear that Sheikh Hasina at the helm will suit its interests. But the challenging part will be reaching out to the people of Bangladesh.\nBBC News India is now on YouTube. Click here to subscribe and watch our documentaries, explainers and features."}

The court filings include 40 documents of evidence from a woman who has made accusations against the prince.\nJohanna Sjoberg claimed Prince Andrew groped her breast while sitting on a couch inside Epstein's Manhattan apartment in 2001.\nBuckingham Palace has previously said the allegations are \"categorically untrue\".\nLast year, the prince paid millions to Ms Giuffre to settle a lawsuit she filed claiming that he sexually abused her when she was 17 years old. \nHe said he had never met Ms Giuffre and denied her allegations. \nThe former US president is mentioned more than 50 times in the court documents, according to ABC News. But there is no implication of any illegality.\nHe travelled on Epstein's plane on humanitarian trips to Africa in the early 2000s and at the time praised Epstein as a committed philanthropist.\nMr Clinton's team have previously said that he cut ties with Epstein before the financier came under investigation. They have in the past said he knows nothing about Epstein's crimes.\nMany of his mentions in these court filings relate to Ms Giuffre's unsuccessful attempts to make the former president testify about his relationship with Epstein, says ABC.\nEpstein, a millionaire known to mix with high-profile figures like Prince Andrew, died in jail in 2019.\nHis death, as he awaited federal sex-trafficking charges, was ruled to be a suicide by the New York medical examiner. \nHe was accused of running a \"vast network\" of underage girls for sex.

Was this a sign of democratic maturity, as the government would have it, or a sham, as the opposition has claimed?\nIt was certainly complex.\nThe country was electing a president, along with national, provincial, and local representatives. There were close to 41 million voters choosing between 100,000 candidates, who came from at least 70 political parties and coalitions.\nBallot papers, polling boxes, and voting machines had to be distributed at 75,000 stations around a country the size of western Europe with few roads. The election material was taken by foot, helicopter, dug-out canoes and motorcycles.\nThe polls were certainly also an historic opportunity. This is the fourth national election since the return of multiparty democracy in 2006; this was also the first time people in the diaspora could vote, and that local elections were held.\nIt was also a chance for the population to weigh in on the monumental challenges they face, to push their leaders to do better.\nSeven million people are displaced in the mineral-rich east due to ongoing violence; 25 million have so little food that their lives are in danger; and, despite enormous mineral wealth, around 73% of the population lives in extreme poverty. And people did mobilise in large numbers, waiting patiently for hours to vote.\nAnd yet, despite the kaleidoscope of parties and the massive challenges facing the country, the election campaigns were largely devoid of concrete policy proposals.\nThe main organising principle was whether you were with President Félix Tshisekedi and his Union for Democracy and Social Progress party (known by its French initials UDPS) or with \"the opposition\". The reason for putting the latter in quotes is that it is more of an aspiration than a real organisation.\nIts three main stalwarts­­ - Moïse Katumbi, a business tycoon and former governor, Martin Fayulu, a former Exxon Mobil executive, and Denis Mukwege, a gynaecologist and 2018 Nobel Peace Prize winner - had tried and failed to unite on either a joint platform or behind a common candidate.\nIn the end, the elections were remarkably disorganised. \"A gigantic, organised disorder,\" Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo of the Roman Catholic Church said.\n\"Une grande bouillabaisse,\" a friend who was monitoring the elections described it - \"a big electoral stew\".\nThe prelate's alarm was informed by the 24,000 election observers fielded by the Catholic and Protestant churches.\nThe statistics they reported back are disturbing: in 551 polling stations (6% of those observed), fights broke out, often because voters were tired from waiting for hours, or because they could not find their names on the voting lists.\nIn 3%, ballot stuffing or the buying of votes was observed and in around a quarter of places the voting machines broke down.\nThe vote, which was supposed to last just for one day, continued for five days in some places, in violation of the electoral law.\nThe scandal that flooded social media was the phenomenon of \"private voting machines\".\nIn one of these videos one can see someone shamelessly cranking out dozens of ballots for Mr Tshisekedi on a voting machine in the privacy of his own apartment; in another one can see two people getting into a fight over which candidate they should use the machine to cheat for.\nWhile it is difficult to verify these videos, the election commission has admitted that some of its machines had been stolen or lost.\nUnsurprisingly, the opposition did not even wait to hear the official results. Just days after the vote began, Mr Fayulu and Mr Mukwege called for the process to be cancelled, while Mr Katumbi said that he had in fact won.\nOn 29 December, the Catholic and Protestant churches gave their preliminary verdict. Their voice is critical.\nIn 2018, it was the Catholic Church that led the charge against the election commission's official results, saying that Mr Tshisekedi had not won the vote.\nIn 2011, the bishops had slammed that result as \"not reflecting the will of the people\".\nEven this time, the churches had been on a war footing with the electoral commission - after all, the head of this body is supposed to be put forward by religious groups, but the government had snubbed the Catholics and the Protestants, who together probably represent around 70% of the population.\nIn the run-up to the poll, the head of the episcopal conference - the Catholic co-ordinating body in the country - had lambasted the commission's chief, Denis Kadima, for getting the elections \"off to a bad start\".\nThe clerics also deplored the violent repression of demonstrations, instrumentalization of the justice system and arbitrary arrests. Mr Kadima pushed back against his critics, calling them \"prophets of doom\".\nIn the end, however, the religious leaders struck a milder tone. They observed that \"one candidate clearly stood out from the others with more than half of the votes alone\".\nIn private, priests left no room for doubt. They confirmed the conclusion of the election commission - Mr Tshisekedi won.\nThis outcome, although not the stratospheric score of 73% proclaimed by the commission, was also what several pre-election polls suggested.\nBut the prelates cited \"numerous cases of irregularities that could affect the integrity of the results of different ballots, in certain places\".\nThey pointed to the various legislative elections and called on the electoral commission and the justice system to live up to their responsibilities, presumably by cancelling the vote and charging abusers where necessary.\nThe president's nationalist firebrand rhetoric - he promised to take the fight to Rwanda if they continue their alleged meddling in the east - and his record of free primary education were probably critical, as was a weak and divided opposition.\nBut this is hardly a victory for democracy.\nThe electoral commission was politicised, as were the courts responsible for judging election disputes. There was no thorough audit of the voter list, and opposition candidates faced headwinds in campaigning and mobilising.\nAll of this percolated into voter turnout: a paltry 43%, down from 67% from the heady 2006 elections. And the elections cost around $1.2bn (£945m), more than the country's education or health budget.\nAs the opposition struggles to contest the results, the real threat is not political instability or riots - as investors and donors seem to fear - but rather the erosion of Congolese democracy.\nIn a country in dire need of greater accountability - to finally move from conflict and poverty to making the country \"the Germany of Africa\", as Mr Tshisekedi has promised - this was a missed opportunity.\nJason K Stearns is the founder and strategic adviser to the Congo Research Group (CRG), based at New York University. He is also the author of Dancing in the Glory of Monsters: The Collapse of the Congo and the Great War of Africa, and The War That Doesn't Say Its Name: The Unending Conflict in the Congo."}

In 2003, the figure was 51.\nMusic writer Patrick Clifton recently identified that statistics like these added up to a \"crisis\" for the British music industry.\n\"A new generation of artists is not building fanbases that will buy gig and festival tickets in two, five, or 10-years' time, and is not popularising songs that will have ubiquity in our culture once this generation of music fans reaches old age,\" he wrote on Medium.\nThe artists who succeed, he argued, are those who are able to cultivate a \"two-way\" relationship with fans on social media, and \"don't mind revisiting songs from their repertoire if those songs blow up\".\nThe year-end charts partially reflect this shift, with artists like PinkPantheress and David Kushner translating viral success into real-world achievements.\nMeanwhile, superstars like Miguel and The Weeknd took overlooked album tracks into the charts for the first time after they resurfaced on TiKTok.\nThe so-called \"long tail\" effect also means that older songs will continue to generate streams after their initial chart run.\nTo that effect, nine hits from 2022 racked up their millionth \"sale\" in 2023, including Eliza Rose's dance anthem BOTA (Baddest Of Them All), George Ezra's Green, Green Grass and Sam Smith's duet with Kim Petras, Unholy.\nOne interesting side-effect of the shift in music habits is that the vinyl charts - once the preserve of collectible classics - now seem more up-to-date than the main album countdown.\nSeven of the top 10 vinyl albums were new releases. Taylor Swift's 1989 was the best-seller, followed by The Rolling Stones' critically-acclaimed comeback Hackney Diamonds. \nNew music from Olivia Rodrigo, Blur and Lewis Capaldi also made the top 10, alongside the perennial best-sellers Rumours, by Fleetwood Mac, and The Dark Side Of The Moon, by Pink Floyd.\nOverall, demand for music continued to grow, with a record 179.6 billion songs streamed in the UK.\nMore than 6 million vinyl records were sold, the highest total since 1990. Ten million albums were sold on CD, and cassette sales topped 100,000 for a fourth consecutive year.\nBut streaming dominates the UK's music habits, now accounting for 87.7% of the market, compared to 63.6% five years ago.\nThe BPI said 2023 was a \"landmark\" year for women, with seven of the top 10 best-selling songs featuring female acts.\n\"This should be celebrated, but without complacency,\" said Jo Twist, the organisation's chief executive. \n\"Our work in the music industry continues to ensure that this becomes the norm.\" "}

Five of the six people on board the smaller aircraft died.\nThe flawless evacuation on the Japan Airlines jet has astounded the world and won praise from many. Aviation experts and flight crew tell the BBC it boiled down to the flight crew putting their rigorous training in place and \"well-behaved\" passengers who obeyed safety protocols.\n\"I don't see a single passenger on the ground, in any of the videos I've seen, that has got their luggage with them… If people tried to take their cabin luggage, that's really dangerous because they would slow down the evacuation,\" said Prof Ed Galea, director of the Fire Safety Engineering Group at the University of Greenwich.\nThe state of the aircraft, an Airbus A350, made the evacuation difficult, Prof Galea said.\n\"This accident was far from ideal. The aircraft was nose down, which meant it was difficult for passengers to move,\" he said.\nOnly three inflatable slides could be used to evacuate passengers but they were not properly deployed because of how the jet landed. The slide was very steep, which could have been dangerous.\nThe aircraft's announcement system also malfunctioned during the evacuation, so the flight crew had to convey instructions using a megaphone and by shouting, Japan Airlines said.\nOne passenger sustained bruises and 13 others requested medical consultations due to physical discomfort, the airline said.\nThe Japan Airlines jet departed from Sapporo's New Chitose airport at 16:00 local time (07:00 GMT) and landed at Haneda shortly before 18:00. The smaller coastguard aircraft was due to deliver aid to victims of a powerful New Year's Day earthquake. An investigation into the collision is under way.\nA former Japan Airlines flight attendant told the BBC that passengers on the commercial flight were \"incredibly fortunate\".\n\"I felt relieved to find out that all the passengers were safe. But when I started thinking about the emergency evacuation procedure, I suddenly felt nervous and fearful,\" she said. \"Depending on how the two planes collided and how the fire spread, it could have been a lot worse.\"\nIn real-life situations, it could be difficult to ensure that passengers do not panic, said the former flight attendant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\"But what they achieved is harder than one can imagine. The fact that they managed to get everyone to escape is a result of good co-ordination among crew and passengers following instructions,\" she said.\nShe said new crew members undergo stringent evacuation and rescue training for up to three weeks before they are allowed to serve in commercial flights. The training is repeated every year.\n\"We go through a written exam, case study discussions and practical training using different scenarios, such as when the plane has to make a water landing or if there is fire on board. Maintenance staff are also involved in such training,\" said the former flight attendant, who left the company 10 years ago.\nA pilot for a South East Asian airline, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the rigorous training that the flight crew had undergone helped with the speedy evacuation.\n\"I must say it was amazing. I think what happened in this case was that the training kicked in. You really don't have time to think in a situation like this, so you just do what you were trained to do,\" he said.\nIn order for any passenger aircraft to be internationally certified, aircraft manufacturers must show that everyone aboard can leave the plane within 90 seconds. Evacuation tests sometimes involve actual passengers, he added.\nThe pilot added that aviation safety regulations had been significantly strengthened after past mishaps.\nFor instance, the collision of two Boeing 747 jets at Los Rodeos Airport in Spain in 1977 - which killed 583 people and remains the deadliest accident in aviation history - led to a review of cockpit procedures and radio communications. The crash was found to be due to miscommunication between flight crew and air traffic controllers.\nJapan Airlines experienced its own catastrophe in August 1985, when Osaka-bound Flight 123 crashed into a mountain shortly after take-off from Tokyo Haneda. It was later attributed to faulty repair work by Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer. Only four out of 524 people on board initially survived the crash.\nIn 2006, Japan Airlines opened a museum-like facility near Haneda displaying wreckage from the incident, aimed at promoting safety awareness among its employees.\n\"In face of the pain and grief of the bereaved families and public distrust in airline safety [after the 1985 crash], we pledged that we would never again allow such a tragic accident to occur,\" Japan Airlines wrote on the facility's webpage.\n\"Every staff is reminded that valuable lives and property are entrusted to us in our work.\"\nAdditional reporting by Mariko Oi\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox."}

Was the cemetery used over a long period of time as burial practices were changing? Or were some people being marked out as different?\nThe items being found around the graves are also surprising and they show how life in the middle of the first millennium was very different from now.\nFragments of dishes and cups have been found, and splinters of animal bone that have been butchered and burnt. One item really brings this community to life: a tiny carved peg that may have been used as a marker for scoring in a game, perhaps something like we use in a cribbage board.\nDr Andy Seaman, a specialist in early medieval archaeology from the University of Cardiff - who is leading the digging team - says unlike cemeteries now, this doesn't seem to be just a place to dispose of the dead.\n\"We tend to think of graveyards as sort of enclosed spaces that we don't really go to, but they probably would have been quite central to life in the past,\" he explained.\n\"And it's not just a place for people being buried, but it's a place where communities are coming together: they are burying their dead, but they're also undertaking other forms of activity, and social practice, including eating and drinking - and feasting\"\nMost perplexing though is that the artefacts being discovered here suggest these people were far from ordinary.\nWhile we're at the dig, an excited shout goes up: \"I've just found a piece of glass.\"\nIt's lying in one of the graves.\n\"It's a rim shard, an ice-cream shaped cone vessel - very fine material, very fine glass… it's a really nice find,\" Andy Seaman says as he admires the fragment.\nHe thinks it's from the Bordeaux region in France - and it's not the only imported item, the team has also found pieces of pottery, possibly from North Africa.\nThe quality of these finds suggests that the people there were of a high status.\nTudur Davies, from the University of Cardiff, says: \"The evidence we've got here is that the people have access to very high quality imported goods, that you can only get through trading or exchange networks, with people with a lot of wealth, to bring it here.\n\"What exactly is going on?

The court filings include 40 documents of evidence from a woman who has made accusations against the prince.\nJohanna Sjoberg claimed Prince Andrew groped her breast while sitting on a couch inside Epstein's Manhattan apartment in 2001.\nBuckingham Palace has previously said the allegations are \"categorically untrue\".\nLast year, the prince paid millions to Ms Giuffre to settle a lawsuit she filed claiming that he sexually abused her when she was 17 years old. \nHe said he had never met Ms Giuffre and denied her allegations. \nThe former US president is mentioned more than 50 times in the court documents, according to ABC News. But there is no implication of any illegality.\nHe travelled on Epstein's plane on humanitarian trips to Africa in the early 2000s and at the time praised Epstein as a committed philanthropist.\nMr Clinton's team have previously said that he cut ties with Epstein before the financier came under investigation. They have in the past said he knows nothing about Epstein's crimes.\nMany of his mentions in these court filings relate to Ms Giuffre's unsuccessful attempts to make the former president testify about his relationship with Epstein, says ABC.\nEpstein, a millionaire known to mix with high-profile figures like Prince Andrew, died in jail in 2019.\nHis death, as he awaited federal sex-trafficking charges, was ruled to be a suicide by the New York medical examiner. \nHe was accused of running a \"vast network\" of underage girls for sex. He pleaded not guilty.\nA decade earlier he had been convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor."}

The tepid, bureaucratic answers by the panellists, including Dr Gay, on how to deal with calls for Jewish genocide prompted the resignation of University of Pennsylvania president Liz Magill.\nAfter that episode, Harvard offered continued support for Dr Gay's tenure as president. But the battle was not over.\nFor her right-wing critics, Dr Gay - who is black - represents much of what they loathe about modern American higher education, which they view as being dominated by a left-wing ideology that places a greater emphasis on ethnic and gender diversity than on academic rigour.\n\"It was a thinly veiled exercise in race and gender when they selected Claudine Gay,\" Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, a Harvard graduate, wrote on social media after she announced her resignation.\nNew York Times columnist Bret Stephens, noting the 53-year-old Dr Gay's relatively thin academic record that includes no published books and 11 journal articles, decried what he called the \"social justice model of higher education\".\nHe wrote that the \"intellectual rot\" in American higher education \"won't stop spreading until universities return to the idea that their central purpose is to identify and nurture and liberate the best minds, not to engineer social utopias\".\nThe plagiarism allegations that led to Dr Gay's resignation were surfaced by Christopher Rufo, a right-wing activist best known for the cultural battle over alleged teaching of Critical Race Theory in US schools.\nIn a December social media post, Mr Rufo laid out what is a now-familiar strategy for conservatives seeking to generate coverage of stories they believe the mainstream media are ignoring.\n\"We launched the Claudine Gay plagiarism story from the right,\" Mr Rufo wrote. \"The next step is to smuggle it into the media apparatus of the left, legitimizing the narrative to centre-left actors who have the power to topple her. Then squeeze.\"\nMr Rufo's efforts were amplified by media outlets that included the New York Post and the Washington Free Beacon, which on Monday published details of a new anonymous complaint filed with Harvard that included additional evidence of alleged plagiarism in Dr Gay's published work.\nIn her resignation letter, Dr Gay said she was \"subjected to personal attacks and threats fuelled by racial animus\", adding that the last few weeks had made clear that more must be done to \"combat bias and hate in all its forms\".\nIt was a sentiment echoed, with more focused anger, by others on the left.\n\"So what we've learned is this: Bad-faith bigots pretending they're concerned about antisemitism will happily use women of colour - especially black women - as a scapegoat and lightning rod for large systemic issues,\" wrote novelist Celeste Ng on social media. \"And that people invested in maintaining those systemic issues will comply.\"\nThe current Harvard controversy reached its culmination with Dr Gay's resignation, but the larger conservative effort to undermine - and ultimately supplant - liberal-dominated institutions of higher education continues.\nIn Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis - a current Republican presidential candidate - replaced the leadership of the New College of Florida, cancelling its diversity and inclusion programmes, firing faculty members and putting right-wing activists, including Mr Rufo, on its board trustees. His goal, in part, is to offer a conservative counterpoint to the modern liberal arts college.\nDonald Trump, as part of his \"Agenda 47\" plan for a second term in office, has called for changes in how US universities are accredited, to emphasise \"defending the American tradition and Western civilization\". He has also pledged to end equity programmes, force universities to reduce overhead costs and tax the endowments of schools that do not comply.\nHarvard may ultimately replace Dr Gay with someone who has a similar academic and political disposition, who continues to defend ways to make Harvard's student body diverse. \nBut by toppling the president of one of the nation's most prestigious universities - the one involved in the Supreme Court fight over racial preferences in admissions earlier this year - conservatives have a substantial victory on which to build."}

In August, a Russian rocket slammed to earth killing two young women as they sat on a bench in a playground, in the shadow of a church.\nTheir names were Kristina Spitsyna and Svitlana Siemieikina, and they are among the more than 10,000 civilians who have lost their lives since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.\nThe UN believes the actual number of men, women and children who have been killed is \"considerably higher\".\nRussia's war in Ukraine is now a constant. The horror has become familiar. Many deaths are not reported in detail, but we wanted to tell the story of the lives, and last moments, of just two of those killed.\nWhen the breeze whispers in the trees, Halyna Spitsyna feels it is the presence of her daughter, Kristina. \"The wind blows, and you think this is the soul of your child, hugging you,\" she says.\nThen she bends to put yellow chrysanthemums in a vase on Kristina's grave.\nHer daughter - a promising young singer - took her last breath in August, together with her best friend Svitlana. They are buried side by side at the edge of an overgrown cemetery.\nThe twin graves are a blaze of colour, stacked with wreaths, and topped with blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flags. The graves stand out - as if calling attention to the youth and talent that have been taken.\nKristina and Svitlana came together in wartime, bonding over a love of music and a love of Ukraine. They formed a duo called Similar Girls. They sang at weddings, and live-streamed street concerts to their Telegram channel, raising money for soldiers and civilians alike.\nOn 9 August they were singing outside a supermarket on a busy street in their hometown of Zaporizhzhia - Svitlana, 18, on guitar, and Kristina, 21, on vocals.\nTheir performance was recorded on a phone. It is haunting to watch.\nThe footage shows Kristina, with long blond hair, wearing shorts, and Svitlana, guitar in hand, in jeans. They are brimming with life.\n\"Our last song will be for all people and the defenders of Kherson,\" says Kristina. She chooses a well-known Ukrainian song called Winning The War. Her voice soars across the evening air.\nUnder the blue sky in the rays of truth\nWith the yellow sun on my shoulder\nWe write books for the future\nHow we will win the war\nHow we win the war\nThat song became their requiem. Twenty minutes later both girls were killed in the playground around the corner where they had gone to take a rest. It was a 300m walk from the main street.\nHalyna is tormented by profound loss and agonising questions - what if the girls had not gone to the playground? What if they had stayed on the street?\nAnd how can she carry on living now?\n\"You don't know what plans to make for tomorrow,\" she says, her face wet with tears. \"Sometimes you can smile, but then you remember that she can't smile any more. It is as if you are dead, but you can speak.\"\nThen, the youthful looking 43-year-old sales manager apologises for being overcome.\nThe rocket attack that killed the girls echoed through the city. Svitlana's father, Yurii Siemieikin, heard it at his home on the outskirts, and jumped straight into his car.\n\"I knew they were somewhere in that district. The police let me through, and I saw what I saw. Svitlana was lying in front of me,\" he says, gesturing to the ground with his hands, as his words fall away.\nHe sits in the shade of a chestnut tree, his wife Anna and their 12-year-old daughter, Sasha, by his side. The family's secluded garden is a universe of grief.\n\"How is it possible in the 21st Century, to do something like this, completely unprovoked?\" asks Yurii, 41, who works on the railways.\nThe Russians, he says, will never be forgiven. \"This will last for generations to come. Our great-grandchildren will remember all they have done here and are continuing to do,\" he says. Yurii speaks slowly, in a low voice, as if holding in his grief is taking every ounce of energy.\nSvitlana was musical from childhood, he says, and wrote her own songs. She loved K-pop and studied foreign languages. Inside the family's modest house her bedroom is just as she left it - with her posters of Nirvana and AC/DC on the wall. Her guitar is still on the bed, as if she might one day return. Now it is Sasha's turn to play it.\n\"She taught me how,\" Sasha says. \"At first it was hard, and I didn't like it. Now I want to keep playing. She wanted everyone to be happy and without war. She wanted to do what she could with her music.\"\nSasha speaks calmly of missiles and air raids - now staples of a Ukrainian childhood. The killing of her sister has changed her calculation of risk, in an unexpected way.\n\"I started paying less attention to the danger,\" she says matter-of-factly. \"I live in my own world. I feel safer now because I feel that Sveta [Svitlana] is always with me.\"\nA framed photo of Svitlana is attached to the cross on her grave, Kristina's photo is alongside, on her grave. In the photos they are looking towards each other, both forever young.\nUkraine is losing some of its brightest and its best, on and off the battlefield. The dead include actors and artists, ballet dancers and sports stars, and voices of the future like Kristina and Svitlana.\nWhen the war broke out, Halyna suggested that the girls should leave. They refused. She says they wanted to keep singing, to lift people's spirits. Halyna grieves not just for her loss, but for what her country is losing every day.\n\"Young people are dying who are very talented and very ambitious. If we don't have children, what future does the country have. It doesn't just impact us,\" she says. \"It can destroy Ukraine.\"\nHalyna says that when Kristina started performing - at the age of five - \"she came on to the scene as a star. She had no fear of the stage. For her, it was vital to sing.\"\nShe imagined her daughter would be famous for her voice, not for her death.\nInstead, she and Svitlana - and many more - are filling early graves.\nHey, listen, Mum.\nI'm going off to war.\nDon't you cry\nI'll come back alive.\nAdditional reporting by Wietske Burema and Natalka Sosnytska"}

Zhuang's family eventually paid $80,000 (£62,600) to the perpetrators.\nExperts told the BBC that advancements in technology have made it easier for criminals to pursue cyber kidnapping schemes. While there is no clear data on the number of cases, they said, Zhuang's experience is not an isolated occurrence. \n\"The way it's being perpetrated in most cases, [it] could happen to anyone,\" said Joseph Steinberg, a cyber security expert who has advised business firms and governments. \"The crimes have gotten much more targeted and much more expensive.\"\nPolice believe kidnappers began manipulating the 17-year-old exchange student as early as 20 December, when he was seen with camping equipment in Utah.\nTypically, cyber kidnappings involve criminals calling or messaging a victim to trick them into thinking a loved one has been kidnapped, though the person is actually safe, Mr Steinberg said. \nVictims have reported hearing screaming on the phone while the perpetrator claimed their loved one was in danger to secure a ransom. \n\"They will do anything to keep you on the phone,\" said Marie-Helen Maras, the director of the Center for Cybercrime Studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \"They'll threaten to cause harm if you hang up or if you try to contact anyone to frighten their targets into making rushed decisions.\"\nThere have been several cases in which Chinese foreign exchange students in other countries - including Canada and Australia - were coerced into staging their own kidnappings to extort money from relatives, said Dr Maras, who has studied cyber kidnapping cases. \nNo data is available on the frequency of virtual kidnappings, which go largely unreported, experts said. They emphasised, however, that advances in technology have facilitated the crimes and made them easier to commit.  \nMr Steinberg said he worries about the use of artificial intelligence to impersonate loved ones' voices and coerce them into paying ransoms. \n\"The technology has reached a point where even loving parents who know their kids really well can be tricked,\" he said. \nSocial media also allows perpetrators to study and collect information on victims before they make contact, allowing them to gain valuable insight on an individual's life. \nCriminals \"can even spoof numbers to make it look like it's coming from you\", Dr Maras said. \"They are becoming increasingly better at obscuring the fraud.\" \nThe crimes seem to be leading to larger payouts now, too, said Mr Steinberg, who noted that perpetrators are rarely caught. \nIn the past, criminals targeted more vulnerable individuals - such as undocumented immigrants and non-native English speakers - for small sums, he said. \nBut in the case of Zhuang, officials said his parents paid a hefty ransom. \n\"Cyber crime is probably the crime that pays the best,\" Mr Steinberg said. \"You can target people in different languages. You can do it from anywhere.\"\nThough experts said that anyone can fall victim to virtual kidnappings, people can take several steps to better protect themselves. \nThe first is simply being aware of the problem, knowing what personal information is public and staying vigilant, Mr Steinberg said. \nBut those who are targeted should report it to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center first. \nAfter initially receiving an emergency call or message, Mr Steinberg also recommends trying to reach the loved one to verify their location. Families can also come up with specific phrases or keywords to use in emergency situations that perpetrators would not be aware of, he said.\nLaw enforcement agencies and telecommunications companies may play a role in preventing the crimes in the future as well by making improvements in authenticating and tracing the source of calls, Mr Steinberg said. \nWhile it remains unknown how many victims are out there, experts said these small steps could help keep people safe. \n\"The reality is that we know that people just like us… have fallen prey,\" Mr Steinberg said.

Ukraine has not commented.\nThe attacks come after Russia launched its biggest aerial bombardment yet.\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says Russia has used some 300 missiles and 200 drones over five days.\nRussia's renewed aerial bombardment on Ukraine began late last week. Ukrainian forces responded with Saturday's attack on Belgorod in which more than 100 people were also injured.\nIn his nightly address, he said Russia had fired \"almost one hundred missiles of various types\" on Tuesday. They had, he said, been \"specifically calculated by the enemy to cause as much damage as possible\".\nAccording to Mr Zelensky, 10 hypersonic ballistic missiles had been shot down on Tuesday alone.\nUkrainian officials said early Wednesday that Tuesday's attacks - including on Ukraine's biggest cities including Kharkiv and Kyiv - had killed or injured more than 130 people across the country.\nMeanwhile, one person was killed and five were injured across the border in Belgorod on Tuesday, according to the region's governor. However, the 12 missiles fired at the area overnight were destroyed by Russia's air defence system, the defence ministry said,\nBlasts were also heard overnight in Sevastopol - the biggest city in Russian-occupied Crimea - where a missile was shot down over the port, the Moscow-installed governor, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said on Telegram. No casualties or damage were reported.\nSpeaking to the BBC, the Ukrainian ambassador to the US, Oksana Markarova, said Russia's recent bombardment was \"not something that came as a surprise\" - but that for Ukraine to win the war they needed more weapons to respond and \"just clearly send a message to Russia that they should stop\".\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has already vowed to step up strikes in response to recent attacks on Belgorod by Ukraine."}

A group of current and former state lawmakers challenged Mr Trump's place on the ballot, which Maine law required Ms Bellows to rule on. \nSeveral lawsuits in other states - such as Michigan and Minnesota - that are similar to the Maine objection have been rejected in court. \nThe US Supreme Court is expected to take up the issue raised in Maine and Colorado, which will not take effect until the legal challenges are settled. A ruling by the court on Mr Trump's eligibility would be applied nationwide. \nDavid Janovksy, a senior policy analyst at the Project on Government Oversight, an independent watchdog, said that \"whichever way the Supreme Court rules is the best outcome\". \n\"The fact that we now have two states in Colorado and Maine that have made this determination against the backdrop of other states that have declined to go that far means that if there was ever a case for the Supreme Court to resolve, this would be it,\" he said. \n\"Time is of the essence now that we're in an election year,\" Mr Janovsky added \nIn an interview with the BBC last week, Ms Bellows defended her actions and said she hoped that the matter would ultimately be settled by the Supreme Court. \nShe said that she was \"mindful\" that no other secretary of state in US history had removed a presidential candidate due to the insurrection clause. \n\"But I'm also mindful that no presidential candidate has, ever before, engaged in insurrection,\" Ms Bellows said.\nShe also denied that her decision was in any way politically motivated, instead arguing that it was \"thorough and based on the rule of law\". \nBoth Mr Trump and his campaign have repeatedly decried the rulings from Maine and Colorado as politically motivated and intended to harm his chances of winning the 2024 election. \nIn addition to the legal wrangling over his eligibility in the election, Mr Trump is facing trials in federal court and in Georgia stemming from his attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.\nHe has not been charged with inciting insurrection in either of the two cases. \nIn a separate case on Tuesday, a federal judge in Washington DC ruled that part of a lawsuit against Mr Trump stemming from the death of a police officer at the 6 January riot can go ahead. \nIn the lawsuit, Sandra Garza - the wife of Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick - sued Mr Trump and two participants in the riot over his death.

I am just about to release,\" Mr Menendez allegedly texted Mr Daibes in August 2021, referring to a press release that contained favourable comments about Qatar. \nAbout a month later, the senator and Mr Daibes attended an event in New York hosted by the Qatari government. \nDays later, the indictment says, Mr Daibes sent the senator photographs of watches ranging in price from $9,990 to $23,990 (£7,900 to £19,000), asking Menendez: \"How about one of these?\"\nIn 2022, ahead of the meeting with Mr Daibes and the Qatari investor in London, Mr Menendez allegedly texted both of them: \"Greetings, I understand my friend is going to visit with you on the 15th of the month. \n\"I hope that this will result in the favorable and mutually beneficial agreement that you have both engaged in discussing.\"\nAmong the benefits Mr Menendez received from the Qataris, the indictment alleges, were tickets to a Formula One Grand Prix race in Miami, Florida.\nIt also claims that one day after returning from a trip to Qatar and Egypt and being picked up at the airport by Mr Daibes driver, the senator performed a web search for \"how much is one kilo of gold worth\".\nA search of the Menendez house in June 2022 discovered, among other things, two one-kilo gold bars that the government says were provided as part of the bribery plot. \nAgents also discovered hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash that bore Mr Daibes' fingerprints and DNA.\nAdam Fee, a lawyer for Mr Menendez said in a statement, \"the government's new allegations stink of desperation\".\nHe said the prosecutors' claims are all \"based on routine, lawful contacts between a Senator and his constituents or foreign officials\".\n\"At all times, Senator Menendez acted entirely appropriately with respect to Qatar, Egypt, and the many other countries he routinely interacts with,\" the lawyer added."}

The mouse is out,\" the trailer screams in red text.\n\"People need to not take it too seriously, we made a ridiculously fun movie,\" said Simon Phillips, who wrote and produce the film and plays the man behind the Mickey mask.\nMr Phillips told the BBC that \"if you put Mickey into a family movie, you don't cover new ground\".\n\"In order to flip the coin, you have to come up with something that's the polar opposite of what already exists,\" he said.\nThe film itself does not have a confirmed release date but is expected to be out this March.\nNot to be outdone, a new video game has been unveiled, also featuring the 1928 version of Mickey.\nGame studio Nightmare Forge Games said the game, titled Infestation 88, is a survival horror game in which an outbreak of vermin turns into something more sinister.\nAt the start of the trailer, a man is heard saying nervously: \"I thought it was just rodents, but there's something else in here.\"\nA huge, blood splattered Mickey then pops up on screen, while mice scurry around him.\nA spokesperson from Nightmare Forge Games told the BBC that Steamboat Willie entering the public domain \"allowed us to include our own derivation of the film's starring character in our game, which fits perfectly as an antagonist causing an infestation\".\nMickey's not the first childhood character to be given the horror movie treatment.\nWhen Winnie the Pooh entered the public domain, the loveable bear was turned into the R-rated horror film Blood and Honey, which was one of last year's worst-rated films.\nUS copyright law says the rights to characters can be held for 95 years, which means the characters in Steamboat Willie entered the public domain on 1 January 2024.\nDisney has faced losing the copyright over its original cartoons several times in the past.\nThe characters were first expected to go into the public domain in 1984, but Congress extended the term by 20 years.\nBefore the next expiry date came up in 2004, another 20-year extension was passed.\nDisney's efforts to protect its characters have even led to the law being dubbed \"the Mickey Mouse Protection Act\". But the moment finally came, and was hailed as being \"deeply symbolic\" by experts.\nThe company still separately holds a trademark on Mickey as a brand identifier and a corporate mascot. That means there are still limits on how the public can use these images.\nAnd Disney has insisted that more modern versions of Mickey are still covered by copyright.\n\"We will, of course, continue to protect our rights in the more modern versions of Mickey Mouse and other works that remain subject to copyright,\" the company said."}
