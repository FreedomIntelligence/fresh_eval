Abrupt environmental\nchanges for a species might lead to changes in the evolutionary process of the\ndescendants to adapt to the environment (Losos, 2011; Mahler, Ingram, Revell,\nand Losos, 2013). The changes in the evolutionary process will be reflected in the\nobserved trait values of present-day species. By detecting abrupt changes based\non observed traits, we can get knowledge of unobserved historical environmental\nchanges and better understand the evolutionary history. The most popular sta-\ntistical models to model the evolutionary process along a phylogenetic tree are\nBrownian Motion (BM, Felsenstein, 1985) and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process\n(Hansen, 1997). Abrupt changes in the evolutionary process are mainly modeled\nby shifts in parameters in these models. Most research in this area focuses on\nthe detection of shifts in mean (BM model) or optimal value (OU model). Butler\nand King (2004) formulate the multiple-optima OU model for adaptive evolu-\ntion. They assume that the optimum is constant along a branch and may differ\nbetween branches due to discrete events where changes in selective regime occur.\nThey test the difference in optima between branches using hypothesis testing.\nUyeda and Harmon (2014) propose a Bayesian framework to detect shifts in the\nselective optimum of OU models. Ho and An´ e (2014) illustrate the limitation of\nAIC and BIC in the shift detection task and introduce modified BIC (Zhang and\nSiegmund, 2006) into the shift detection task. They perform forward-backward\nselection to conduct model selection. Khabbazian et al. (2016) formulate the\nshift detection problem into a variable selection problem and combine the OU\nmodel with LASSO to detect the shift points, which they implement in the\nℓ1ouRpackage. The application of LASSO makes it a fast method. Further,\nthey propose a new information criterion pBIC with correction for phylogenetic\ncorrelations. Bastide et al. (2017) develop a maximum likelihood estimationDETECTION OF SHIFTS IN VARIANCE\nprocedure based on the EM algorithm, which they implement in the Rpackage\nPhylogeneticEM. Zhang et al. (2022) propose an ensemble variable selection\nmethod ( Rpackage ELPASO). They conduct simulations for scenarios when the\ncommon model assumptions are violated and show that measurement error, tree\nconstruction error and shifts in the diffusion variance impact the performances\nof the current methods.\nHowever, these methods only consider shifts in optimal values (mean) with-\nout considering shifts in variances. In reality, when abrupt environmental shifts\noccur, they are likely to not only affect the optimal values but also affect the\nvariances of traits. There are some existing models which allow variance ( σ2)\nto change. Beaulieu et al.

Introduction\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an infectious agent that attacks\nthe immune system, and if not treated properly, it can lead to severe conse-\nquences. It was discovered in 1981 and thereafter it has infected more than\n80 million people and caused the deaths of more than 40 million. By the end\n2of 2021, the World Health Organization estimated that, globally, about 38.4\nmillion people were living with HIV [1]. There are no vaccines for HIV, and\nit cannot be cured yet. Despite this, with regular treatment and high-quality\nhealth care, people living with HIV (PLHIV) can have a life expectancy\ncomparable to that of people not infected by the virus.\nAntiretroviral therapy (ART) has been shown to be effective in controlling\nviral replication for most PLHIV. If no ART is used, HIV-infected patients\ncome to manifest symptoms of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\nCommonly, an ART usually consists of a cocktail of three antiretroviral drugs\nthat cooperatively block virus replication at multiple steps and, compared to\na single drug, are successful in prolonging the time it takes for HIV to become\nresistant to therapy. This success is due to the development of potent and\nwell-tolerated antiretroviral drugs with high genetic barriers to resistance.\nAs a result, it is increasingly common to switch patients under prolonged\nsuccessful therapy to a simplified and highly tolerated regimen, even a dual-\ndrug regimen. However, before a change of therapy, patient records should be\ncarefully analyzed to guide treatment choices and preserve future treatment\noptions. This includes reviewing past drug exposure, treatment failures,\ncumulative drug resistance, and duration of virological suppression [2, 3].\nBy examining the correlation b"}

Several modalities are used in newborns and infants to \ncharacterize the properties of the developing brain, from growth, morphology to microstructure \nand functional specialization.

Early alterations in normal neural development can lead \nto a variety of behavioral disorders  that manifest  in childhood . It is therefore important to gain \na better understanding of these phenomena, which requires linking brain and behavioral \nchanges in vivo . This is why th e use of non -invasive neuroimaging methods such as ‘magnetic \nresonance imaging ’ (MRI) has revolutionized our knowledge in this field over the last twenty \nyears.  \nBefore describing the se recent advances , it is important to remember that MRI  \nmeasurements only indirectly reflect the complex series of dynamic  and intertwined \nmechanisms  observed throughout development  at the molecular, cellular and network  levels , \nwhich occur within a highly constrained but constantly evolving  context  (Stiles and Jernigan \n2010, Kostović, Sedmak et al. 2019) .

Both in theoretical approaches (computer  \nmodeling and analysis) and in real experiments (replication of biological macromolecules), parasitic \nprocesses emerge almost immediately. An effective way to avoid the elimination of the host -parasite \nsystem is through compartmentalization. In both theory  and experiments, the pressure of parasitism leads \nto the complexification of the host -parasite system into a network of cooperative replicators and their \nparasites. Parasites have the ability to create niches for new replicators. The co -evolutionary arms race \nbetween defense systems and counter -defense mechanisms among parasites and hosts can progress for a \nconsiderable duration, involving multiple stages, if not indefinitely.    \n \nОглавление  \nAbstract  ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .........................  1 \n1.

Действительно, \nнакопленные знания свидетельствуют о том, что на самых ранних этапах жизни организмы были \nорганизованы много проще, чем бол ьшинство современных. Так что проблема усложнения  \n(комплексификации1) процессов и механизмов в эволюции остается одной из актуальных на \nсегодня.   \nРассматривая детально пути эволюции, можно обнаружить этапы появления новых свойств, а \nтакже этапы медленног о изменения существующих. Чтобы смоделировать происхождение новых \nфункций, нам нужен механизм того, как сложное поведение более высокого уровня возникает из \nвзаимодействий низкого уровня [Kaneko, 20061]. Природа, как видно, использует малоизученные и \nдаже  еще неисследованные механизмы эволюционного усложнения.   \nУсложнение генетических программ построения организма из единственной исходной клетки — \nодин из наиболее впечатляющих аспектов становления организации живых существ в эволюции. \nСовременная биология  рассматривает генетические программы в рамках концепции генетических \nсетей, поэтому под усложнением такой программы понимают усложнение  организации \nгенетических сетей (т.е. числа генов в ансамбле и количества функциональных связей между \nними).

Cells employ various repair methods known as non-homologous end \njoining (NHEJ ), microhomology mediated end joining ( MMEJ ), and homology -directed recombination \n(HDR). These repair processes may lead to DNA sequence variations (e.g., nucleotide insertions, deletions, \nand substitutions) at the location of the break. Studying DNA DSB repair process es often involves the use \nof high throughput sequencing assays to precisely quantify the sequence variations near the break  with \nsoftware tools . Often methods of assessing and visualizing th ese data have not taken into account  the full \ncomplexity  of the sequencing data, such as the frequency, type, and position of the sequence variations in \na single comprehensive representation . Here we present a method that allows visualization of  the overall \nvariation pattern as well as comparison of  these pattern s among  experimental setups . \n \n \nIntro duction  \nIn recent years, DNA repair of double -strand break ( DSB ) and genome editing  promoted by DSBs \nhave been studied by DNA high throughput sequencing of the genetic material obtained after the DNA \nrepair of experimentally induced breaks , frequently by CRISPR/Cas9 assays, at specific locations in a  \ngenetic sequence1–3. In the case of  breaks induced in DNA within cell environments, the  repair  may be done  by one of the natural repair processes, including the error  prone non-homologous end -joining  (NHEJ)  or \nmicrohomology  mediated end -joining  (MMEJ ) pathways , or the  precise  homology- directed repair (HDR) \npathway tha t could  be used for genome editing4–6. To study the repaired DNA,  a process known as targeted \namplicon sequencing (or targeted next generation sequencin g (NGS), amplicon sequencing , amplicon deep \nsequencing , etc.)  is used , where primers are applied near  locations around the DSB that allow amplification \nof the sequence around the repaired DSB that is then  sequence d with high -throughput sequencing \ntechnolog ies7. The resulting sequencing reads are  aligned to the expected repair outcome, called the \nreference sequence  (or reference amplicon , amplicon sequence , amplicon,  etc.), to detect and quantify the \nvariations (insertions, deletions, and substitutions) near the DSB site resulting from the repair process.  The \nhuge amount of data produced by high- throughput sequencing platforms , such as Illumina HiSeq8, call for \nautomated tools and various software to analyze the data . Such software tools include  CRISPR-GA9, \nAGEseq10, CrispRVariants11, CRISPResso12, BATCH-GE13, Cas-Analyzer14, CRISPR-DAV15, \nHi-FiBR16, RIMA17, CRISPResso218, ampliCan19, and PEM-Q20. However, these tools have not \nconsidered  the full  information contained in the  sequencing data and often  summarize  the distribution of \ninsertions and deletions (indel s) using figures  focused on a couple of properties of the data. For example,  \nsuch figures may include 2D histograms showing indel frequency vs. positions on the reference  sequence \nor indel frequency  vs. length of indel  (e.g., CRISPR-GA, CRISPResso, Cas-Analyzer, CRISPR-\nDAV, and CRISPResso2 ) though some tools  also show  a list of  the most frequently occurring variants \naligned to the reference sequence (e.g., CrispRVariants, BATCH-GE, Cas-Analyzer , RIMA , \nCRISPResso2, and ampliCan ). \nHere we present  DSBplot, a software tool developed to represent sequence variations and their \nrespective frequencies in libraries obtained from targeted amplicon sequencing.

Very often changes in the concentration of extracellular substances occur\nwhich, through receptor binding, give rise to a sequence of intracellular changes in\nwhat is called a signaling cascade .

A statistical analysis of the time intervals between subsequent IP 3R-\nmediated Ca2+pulses observed experimentally has revealed an exponential dependence\nwith the external stimulus strength in several cell types. This type of dependence,\nwhich is reminiscent of Kramers’ law for thermally activated barrier crossing, has also\nbeen derived for certain excitable systems. Excitable systems have a stable stationary\nsolution and, upon perturbations that surpass a threshold, perform a long excursion\nin phase space before returning to equilibrium. In this paper we use a very simple\nmathematical model of IP 3R-mediated Ca2+signals and published experimental results\nto derive the scaling law between the interpulse time and the external stimulus strength.\n1. Introduction\nCells continuously interact with their surroundings, not only to exchange nutrients\nand energy, but also to detect environmental changes and act accordingly [43].\nVery frequently changes in the environment are endowed in concentration changes of\nsubstances that can bind to plasma membrane receptors. This, in turn, induces changes\nin the concentration and/or activation level of various intracellular components in what\nis known as a signaling cascade . Cells use different strategies to go from the external\nstimulus to the end response [44, 30, 14]. Sometimes, increasing intensities of the\nexternal stimulus are “encoded” in increasing concentrations of the internal messengers\n(amplitude codification) [48]. On other occasions, stimuli induce a pulsatile behavior in\nsome of the intermediaries in which the frequency increases with the stimulus strengtharXiv:2312.17629v1  [q-bio.CB]  29 Dec 2023Frequency encoding and excitability 2\n(frequency encoding) [4, 5]. This last behavior has been observed in intracellular Ca2+\nsignals [7, 42] that involve Ca2+release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through\nInositol Trisphosphate Receptors (IP 3Rs) [12].\nCa2+is ubiquitous as intracellular messenger. It is involved in the control of many\ncellular functions including both fertilization and cell death [2]. On many occasions,\nthe selective control of specific targets depends on the spatio-temporal of the cytosolic\nCa2+concentration. Ca2+release from the ER through IP 3Rs give cells the tools to\nproduce different spatio-temporal patterns. On one hand, IP 3Rs need to bind IP 3and\nCa2+to become open. Therefore, the opening of one such channel can lead to the\nopening of many others due to Calcium Induced Calcium Release [11]. IP 3Rs, in turn,\nare usually organized in clusters containing ∼10−20 channels. Furthermore, high Ca2+\nconcentrations inhibit IP 3Rs. Thus, the signals can range from blips andpuffs involving\nCa2+release from one channel or cluster, to waves that propagate throughout the cell\ndepending on the level of IP 3[46, 40, 39] and the interplay between Ca2+activation and\ninhibition. In many different cell types, constant stimulation with extracellular ligands\ncan yield sequences of these waves that, when the interior of the cell is not resolved, are\nvisualized with fluorescence microscopy techniques as sequences of Ca2+spikes [7, 42].\nUsually each Ca2+spike is preceded by localized signals which start to occur more\nfrequently until they yield the global release event [29]. This is typical of spatially\nextended excitable systems in which random local (Ca2+release) events are amplified\nthrough space eventually triggering an “extreme” one (a Ca2+spike) [26, 18]. We\nhereby recall the defining characteristics of excitable systems: the existence of a stable\nstationary state, a threshold which, if surpassed by perturbations, a long excursion in\nphase space occurs before the system returns to the stationary solution and a refractory\nperiod before a new spike can be elicited by perturbations [19].\nA systematic study of intracellular Ca2+pulses evoked by constant concentrations\nof extracellular ligands showed, in many cell types, that the interspike "}

Taking this mathematical statement seriously\nrequires that the network dynamics have a zero mode, which connects to many other observations\non this system.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nClosely related organisms can vary widely in size, but\nvariations in their proportions are much smaller [1–3].\nThere is a considerable gap between this qualitative ob-\nservation and some precise mathematical statement of\nscaling, e.g., that the linear dimensions of all elements in\nthe body plan are in direct proportion to the linear di-\nmensions of the organism. If correct this scale invariance\nwould be visible not only in the fully developed organism\nbut already at some earlier stages in its development.\nThere are many examples of “allometric scaling,”\npower-law relationships among different quantities across\na well-defined class of organisms [4–6]. In some cases,\nthese relations connect the linear dimensions of different\nbody parts. Nonetheless, truly precise spatial scaling in\nembryonic development would be quite surprising.\nWe understand the mechanisms of pattern formation in\na wide range of non–biological systems, from fluid flows\nto crystal growth (snowflakes) and more [7–12], but none\nof these examples exhibit scale invariance. Instead, the\nelements of the pattern have linear dimensions set by\nmicroscopic parameters, and larger systems exhibit more\nrepetitions of the same pattern rather than expansion\nor contraction of pattern elements to match the size of\nthe system as a whole [13]. Going back to the pioneer-\ning work of Turing [14], the mathematical structure of\nthe equations governing these systems is not so different\nfrom the structure of models for genetic or biochemical\nnetworks. If we take these analogies literally, we would\npredict that taller people should have more vertebrae,\nwhich is obviously wrong. Is there a real problem here,\nor are we just oversimplifying?Here we try to make the notion of scale invariance in\ndevelopment more precise. We use the first hours of de-\nvelopment in the fruit fly as an example, following spa-\ntial patterns of morphogen concentration as they flow\nthrough three layers of a genetic network, from maternal\ninputs to the gap genes to the pair rule genes [15–17]. In\nthe spirit of earlier work [18–22] we analyze discrete po-\nsitional markers, such as the stripes in pair rule-gene ex-\npression, and find that positions of these markers vary in\nproportion to the length of the embryo with better than\n1% accuracy [23]. We then go beyond discrete markers,\ndecomposing the information carried by graded patterns\nof gap gene expression into information about fractional\nor scaled position vs. information about the absolute po-\nsition; we find that all the available information is about\nfractional position along the anterior–posterior axis. In-\nformation that would signal a deviation from scale invari-\nance is less than 1% of the total.\nThese results provide strong evidence for scaling in a\nprecise mathematical sense, for both the gap genes and\nthe pair rule genes. But at least one of the maternal\ninputs, Bicoid [24, 25], does not show any sign of scale\ninvariance: as in well-understood non-biological pattern-\nforming systems, there is a length scale that presumably\nis set by underlying molecular parameters and does not\nadjust in respon"}

In both cases,\nour approach demonstrate promising preliminary results. We make our code available at\nhttps://github.com/KuNyaa/RNA_Design_codebase.\n1 Introduction\nRibonucleic acid (RNA) is of utmost importance in life because it plays both the informational role where\nmessenger RNAs (mRNAs) pass genetic information from DNAs to proteins [Crick, 1970] as well as the\nfunctional roles where non-coding RNAs facilitate protein translation, catalyze reactions, and regulate gene\nexpression [Eddy, 2001, Doudna and Cech, 2002]. By contrast, DNA has an informational role and protein\nonly functional ones. In addition, the public became more aware of RNA because COVID-19 was caused by\nthe RNA virus SARS-CoV-2 [Wu et al., 2020], which was then partially contained by mRNA vaccines [Baden\net al., 2021, Polack et al., 2020].\nThe field of RNA design has applications in diagnostics and therapeutics [Zhang et al., 2023, Zhou et al.,\n2023]. There are two broad categories of RNA design problems, which correspond to the two roles of RNAs\nabove. The first type (“information passing”) is to design optimal mRNAs given a protein, which aims to\nfind the optimal mRNA in terms of factors such as stability and codon optimality among all the mRNA\nsequences that translate to that protein [Mauger et al., 2019, Cohen and Skiena, 2003, Terai et al., 2016].\nFor example, Zhang et al. [2023] designed an efficient algorithm for mRNA design that jointly optimizes\nminimum free energy (MFE) and codon optimality, by reducing the mRNA design problem to lattice parsing,\nwhere the design space is a regular language (encoded by a finite-state automata) and the objective function\n∗equal contribution\n†corresponding author: liang.huang.sh@gmail.comarXiv:2401.00037v1  [q-bio.BM]  29 Dec 2023(energy) is encoded by a stochastic context-free grammar. However, the mRNA design problem optimizing for\npartition function [McCaskill, 1990] (i.e., ensemble free energy) is wide open, and is likely NP-hard due to the\nminimization over a summation (instead of minimization over a minimization in the MFE case). The second\ntype (structural/functional) is to design an non-coding RNA for a secondary structure, which aims to find an\nRNA sequence that naturally folds, or has the highest probability of folding, into that structure [Zadeh et al.,\n2011, Garcia-Martin et al., 2013, Portela, 2018, Zhou et al., 2023]. Some instance of this problem has been\nproved to be NP-hard [Bonnet et al., 2020].\nWhile these RNA design problems are by default discrete optimization problems that were tackled by local\nsearch methods such as random walk [Zhou et al., 2023], we offer an alternative view and instead formulate\nthem as continuous optimization instances. The basic idea is to start with a distribution over all possible\ncandidate sequences, and extend the objective function from a sequence to be the expectation on a distribution.\nThis extension makes use of a new concept, “expected partition function” (Section 2), which is a generalization\nof the classical single-sequence partition function [McCaskill, 1990].3We then use gradient descent-based\noptimization methods (Section 4) to improve the extended objective function, and the distribution will gradually\nshrink towards a one-hot sequence (i.e., a single sequence). We consider two important case studies within this\nframework, the mRNA design problem optimizing for ensemble free energy (Section 3.1) and the non-coding\nRNA design problem optimizing for conditional (i.e., Boltzmann) probabil"}

Current\ntechniques enable the capture and modulation of intact neural circuit activity during complex behaviors, aligning these\nrecordings with detailed molecular and anatomical maps. Advanced statistical tools unlock computational patterns\nin this vast data. Neuroscientists are increasingly coming together in large teams to develop and implement these\nnew techniques at scales beyond the individual laboratory. However, larger projects often undergo chaotic phases as\ndiverse teams strive to integrate disparate technical and organizational methods. The central question looms: How can\nadvancements in neurotechnologies be translated into substantial scientific breakthroughs?\nTo keep pace with neurotechnologies, research teams require a revolution in their scientific operations. As the complexity\nof coordinating data and computation grows, it is crucial to boost collaboration, streamline processes, reduce errors,\npromote data integration and prioritize reproducibility. A new catalyst for discovery is the integration of artificial\nintelligence into research activities—a prospect that demands a formalized approach to scientific workflows1,2. Through\nenhanced operations, teams can integrate and navigate vast data, blending human ingenuity with emerging artificial\nintelligence. As the challenges increase, a clear roadmap becomes vital, steering research teams from their current\npractices towards greater capacities for ambitious projects.\n2 Capability Maturity Model for Scientific Operations\nTo address the question of research teams’ readiness to tackle complex challenges with robust methods, we introduce\nthe Capability Maturity Model for Scientific Operations (Fig. 1).

However, there exists a richer and potentially more useful set of measures, termed \ndiversity measures, that incorporate elements’ frequencies and between -eleme nt similarities. \nAlthough these have been available in the R and Julia programming languages for other \napplications, they have not been as readily available in Python, which is widely used for \nmachine learning, and are not easily applied to machine -learnin g-sized datasets without special \ncoding considerations. To address these issues, we developed greylock , a Python package that \ncalculates diversity measures and is tailored to large datasets. greylock  can calculate any of the \nfrequency -sensitive measures of Hill’s D-number framework , and going beyond Hill, their \nsimilarity -sensitive counterparts  (Greylock  is a mountain) . greylock  also outputs measures that \ncompare datasets ( 𝛽 diversities). We first briefly review the D -number framework, illustrating \nhow it incorporates elements’ frequencies and between -element similarities . We then describe \ngreylock ’s key features  and usage . We end with several examples —immunomics, \nmetagenomics, computational pathology, and medical imaging —illustrating greylock ’s \napplicability across a range of dataset types and fields .   3 Introduction  \nAssessing the size and quality of a dataset is an important part of machine  learning in many \nfields (Table 1). How many unique elements are there, and how do they relate to each other? \nHow do they cluster? Summary statistics provide initial answers and can form the basis for \ndeeper questions. Historically, different statistics have featured more prominently in different \nareas of investigation . Examples include species richness in ecology , Shannon entropy in \ncomputer science , and Simpson's index in biology.  In several fields, the practice is to bin \nelements before calculating statistics. For example, in metagenomics, sequences are usually \nbinned into operational taxonomic units (OTUs); in immunomics, antibody and T -cell receptor \n(TCR) genes are often binned b y lineage or antigen specificity. In machine learning, elements \nare binned by label to calculate class balance.  \nFrequency -sensitive diversity measures  \nIt has long been known that the summary statistics above , among others,  are related by how \nthey account for differences in the relative frequency of repeated dataset elements [1]. For \nexample , species richness, Shannon entropy, and Simpson's index, in that order , place an \nincreasing emphasis on element frequency, essentially down -weighting elements that appear \nless frequently by having them contribute less to the statistic’s final value . For example, in \nmetagenomic dataset s, species richness weights all OTUs the same regardless of how frequent \nthey are , whereas in Simpson ’s index rare OTUs  count less . In fact, these statistics are highly \nrelated to each other in that they are speci fic instances of a more general formula, known as \nHill’s diversity framework, in which the key parameter is the frequency down -weight ing 𝑞 \n(sometimes  known as the “viewpoint parameter ”) [2]: \n 𝐷𝑞=(∑𝑝𝑖𝑞𝑛\n𝑖=1)1\n1−𝑞  Eq. (1) \n(Note 𝐷𝑞 also appears in the literature as 𝐷𝑞.) In this equation, the dataset contains 𝑛 unique \nelements and 𝑝𝑖 is the frequency of the 𝑖th unique element in the dataset. In the limit of 𝑞=1, \nEq. (1) approaches exp⁡(−∑𝑝𝑖ln𝑝𝑖)𝑛\n𝑖 , which the exponential of the Shannon entropy [3]. The \nonly substantive difference between species richness, Shannon entropy, Simpson's index, and \nmany other summary statistics is in the value of 𝑞: 𝑞=0 for species richness ( all elements \ncount the same ), 𝑞=1 for Shannon entropy (some down -weight ing of rare elements ), 𝑞=2 for \nSimpson's index (more down -weig"}
