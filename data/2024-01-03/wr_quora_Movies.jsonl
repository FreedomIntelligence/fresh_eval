Hindu has deviated himself from path because of manipulation in texts and as he doesn't knows Sanskrit so he is unaware about religion,texts too and also blame the invasions of foreigners who destroyed texts, buildings,mandirs\n\nNow take an example of Muslims it is unimaginable to even think that anyone would even dare to draw a picture of Prophet or it is unimaginable to think anyone doing role of Sikhs First Guru Guru Nanak Ji or any Sikh Guru like Guru Gobind Singh Ji because of the code of conduct. There is something such as code of conduct which is absent among Hindus. Code of conduct is prevalent among Sikhs,Muslims,Jews\n\nwhat we see here is this below\n\nüëÜüëÜ\n\nNow just tell me what representation is made in mind of a person who wants to be a film producer or director and sees this mocking of religion himself since child hood. Hindu himself is responsible for this. If Hindu was wise he wouldn't have let anyone do this. Wearing costume of shiva people ask for money even I can show u on ghats and chowks in holy cities and when a producer and director dares to show this incident in P.K it becomes insult to religion. Are we practical people? Are we not insulting our religion ourselves by allowing this mimicking at first instance?\n\nAnd see these songs below.

When casting news drops, it's like chumming the water for film aficionados and comic book fans. You see, everyone's got an opinion, and with the relative anonymity of the internet, those opinions can get as harsh as Portland rain in the middle of winter.\n\nThere's this celeb mythos that every actor who steps into the ring of a franchise film will have skin as thick as the Dark Knight's armor. But they're human, and words can hit harder than Batarangs.\n\nNow, we're talking about Tom Hardy, a man who's played roles from a notorious British prisoner to Mad Max. He's got range, intensity, and the physicality to pull off a convincing Bane. The truth is, Tom faced quite a bit of backlash when he was first cast. The Dark Knight's fanbase can be protective and, yes, critical. But there's a difference between a few trolls spewing vitriol and a universal backlash.\n\nDid he actually cry over it? That seems more like tabloid fodder than reality. Actors, especially ones who take on roles like Bane, tend to develop a tough exterior against public opinion. Hardy's given no public indication of shedding tears over the role.\n\nIn fact, what's often overlooked is the overwhelming support an actor gets from devoted fans, and after \"The Dark Knight Rises\" hit theaters, many fans and critics alike praised Tom's portrayal of Bane. It was intense, memorable, and added a fresh take on an iconic villain.\n\nSo, while it makes for a sensational headline, Hardy's tough guy persona and professional history suggest that he's more likely to hit the gym and channel that frustration into his performance than to start crying about it. And honestly, the way he owned that role, it's clear that whatever initial reactions he faced, he had the last laugh... or should I say, the last menacing monologue."}

Honestly I didn't even notice it until the film was mostly over, and then only because the characters were talking about it.\n\nIn Wonder, a little boy, played by Jacob Tremblay, suffers from birth defects that cause him to have an abnormal appearance so out of the ordinary as to be frankly alarming.

Casting a relatively unknown actress like Sasha Calle as Supergirl in the DCEU is what Hollywood's silver screen needs more of‚Äîfresh faces. It's a gutsy move that can either pay off big time or backfire, but isn‚Äôt that the exciting part of cinema?\n\nHistorically, we've seen unknown actors bring a sense of authenticity and rawness to superhero roles. Remember when Henry Cavill first donned the cape, or when Gal Gadot took up the Lasso of Truth? There's a certain thrill in witnessing a new talent step into such a massive role, and often, they grow into the character in a way that more established actors can't, simply because we don't see them as \"that person from that other thing.\"\n\nNow, focusing in on Calle herself, who has mainly been seen in 'The Young and the Restless'. She‚Äôs got the acting chops and the charisma‚Äìand let's be clear, charisma is half the battle in winning over comic book fans. The snippet of her finding out she got the part that circulated on the web showcased a genuine reaction that endeared her to many instantly. That kind of infectious enthusiasm resonates with people.\n\nWhat about her as Supergirl? Given the right script and direction, I reckon Calle could be a standout Supergirl who brings something new to the table. Supergirl, as a character, needs to embody hope, strength, and a touch of vulnerability ‚Äì it‚Äôs a complex balance. From what I‚Äôve seen, Calle could deliver a Supergirl who‚Äôs not just a female Superman, but a hero in her own right.\n\nLiving here in Portland, OR, I've seen a real push for more diversity and inclusivity in all forms of media, which Calle‚Äôs casting also exemplifies. She will be the first Latina Supergirl, which is a milestone and means a lot to countless fans who want to see themselves represented. It's a sign of the times and, frankly, a long overdue shift towards a more global lens in Hollywood, acknowledging the rich tapestry of its audience.\n\nSure, there will always be naysayers when it comes to any casting decision ‚Äì especially when it involves beloved comic book characters. But if the DCEU is looking to move forward, evolve, and perhaps catch up a little with the competition, rolling the dice on a talented actress like Calle may just be the super move they needed.\n\nAnd after all is said and done, isn't it the storyline, the action, and overall portrayal that we'll ultimately judge? So, let's give the woman a chance to fly before we decide if she soars or stalls. For now, I'm cautiously optimistic that we'll see something special when Sasha Calle spreads her Supergirl wings."}

Creating a film based on the extensive novel Ponniyin Selvan by Kalki posed significant challenges. While I haven't read the book, I went through a summary before watching the film on Amazon Prime Video to have a general understanding of the characters, family tree, and the Chola and Pandyan dynasties. I watched in the original language (Tamil) with subtitles to stay connected with the characters.\n\nIt disappoints me that some audiences expect historical films to be solely about action scenes. Despite comparisons to Bahubali, Magadheera, or Tanhaji, I appreciate the film for its focus on political drama rather than just action. It's disheartening to hear some of my friends find it boring, as I believe the film offers much more depth.\n\nThe cinematography by the talented Ravi Varman, known for his previous works like Tamasha and Barfi, is outstanding. The frames are a work of art, capturing various angles with precision. Kudos to the team for shooting on real locations wherever possible, and avoiding excessive dependence on green screens. One of my favorite scenes is the one in the caves with Buddhist monks. I mean just look at this beauty‚Äî\n\nCinematography is not just about shots of beautiful landscapes but also about the lighting props. Just look at the lighting work done in these shots. The natural lighting coming from diyas adds more beauty to the frames. Ponniyin Selvan will go down in history as one of the best cinematography ever.\n\nI was disappointed with the camera work in the action sequences. Although the film isn't primarily about action, I must say the action choreography was decent, but the editing of these scenes was poor. It made the action sequences look poorly executed. I praise the big-scale action scenes with so many stuntmen, but I wish they could've been better. Except for the starting fight of Adithya Karikalan, no other scene impressed me. The last battle felt rushed. With more compelling action sequences, even if the amount is less, the film and its political drama would have fleshed out really well.\n\nI have mixed opinions on the songs in the film, as some songs add to the film's long length. Otherwise, the background score was good. With the great A.R. Rahman on board, it was not up to the expectations and could have been done better.\n\nCast: The cast is so huge and filled with such talented people that I can't write about all. I was happy to see actors like Parthiban and Kishore. I was just as stunned as Vallavaraiyan when he saw Nandini for the first time. Aishwariya and Trisha looked gorgeous, and I couldn't see anyone else on the screen when they appeared. All the performances were great but Aishwariya, Vikram, and Karthi stole the show as the main leads. The performances by Aishwariya and Vikram will be remembered for a long time. The climax scene where Karikalan kills himself in front of Nandini was so good, probably one of the best scenes in Indian cinema.\n\nAlso, the death of Nandini was very poetic. But I wished her mother Mandakini was used properly.\n\nThe film has some signature tropes of Mani Ratnam films like this mirror scene, love angle, and rain but there was a lack of long shots just like in Mani‚Äôs previous films. This is not a drawback but just a Mani Ratnam fan stating his thoughts.\n\nIt is the drama that makes the film, with the fight for the throne among several kings, political cunningness, loyalty, and not to forget the grand sets created. Keeping in mind the budget, I feel the VFX and CGI used were good‚Äînothing exceptional, but they do a good job and do not feel out of place. The screenplay lags at several moments and some scene unnecessarily adds to the length of the film, it could have been avoided easily.\n\nI am very happy that the dream project for both filmmakers and Tamil audiences came true on the screen, and it didn't disappoint. I can understand why this film did not work in the Hindi belt. Still, both films earned well and were among the highest-grossers. I watched both parts yesterday and couldn't stop myself from writing about this, even if the hype and interest in the film have faded after several months since its release.\n\nI truly stand by the fact that a web series of 4‚Äì5 seasons is the best medium to capture this beautiful novel, but it also comes with a huge cost and effort. One day, we will definitely have a period drama web series like Vikings or Game of Thrones.\n\nCheers."}

Despite having studied Philosophy at University he was drawn to the stage as a young man and despite his notable accent, his excellent command of English, deep menacing voice and natural talent soon saw him cast in British films during WWII, where one of his early roles was as Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nA very much in demand actor, he was often on the London stage as well. At one point he was offered a seven picture deal by a Hollywood studio but was denied a visa by the U.S. Embassy. However the British film, television and stage industries kept him busy for over half a century. He usually played villainous foreigners but occasionally he played the hero, notably in the well received TV show The Human Jungle, where he played a psychiatrist helping his patients (and sometimes the police) prevent or solve a crime. He also appeared in various British films including for the Hammer horror studios. However his most famous and lasting role was as a supporting actor in the Pink Panther film series where he played Police Commissioner Dreyfus, the long suffering boss of the inept and incompetent Inspector Jacques Clouseau, famously played by Peter Sellers. In fact Lom (who had played the role of ‚ÄòLouie‚Äô in the Ealing comedy film The Ladykillers alongside Sellers 9 years earlier) was so memorable in the role that his scenes were expanded in the sequels. His comic timing, deadpan delivery, facial expressions and total despair at how a complete moron like Clouseau could somehow solve crimes by sheer fluke and luck were often some of the funniest scenes in the films. The characters subsequent nervous breakdowns and accidents caused by Clouseau‚Äôs idiocy inspired some of his most memorable moments (the scene where he tries to shoot Clouseau with a snipers rifle in 1975s The Return of the Pink Panther, misses and instead kills the villain who was about to shoot Clouseau anyway is absolutely hilarious).\n\nLom would continue acting long after Sellers death in 1980. He appeared in a few Hollywood movies like The Dead Zone in 1983 and King Solomons Mines in 1985 and also turned up in various film and TV Agatha Christie adaptations where his grumpy personality and distinctive voice were always put to good use. One of his last acting jobs was turning up opposite Jasper Carrot and Robert Powell in an episode of the BBC spoof cop comedy series ‚ÄòThe Detectives‚Äô He died in his sleep in 2012 age 95 at his home in London having made his first movie (a Czech film called ‚ÄòZena pod kr√≠zem‚Äô) 75 years earlier."}

He always had this lovable everyguy quality about him, mixed with a bit of neurotic wit. Even his offbeat roles retained a certain relatable humanity.\n\nNow, flip the script and think about Spock. Spock is the epitome of stoicism, a character steeped in an enigmatic blend of Vulcan logic and subtle, often suppressed, human emotion. Leonard Nimoy brought an inimitable gravitas to the role that was all about nuance; an eyebrow raise here, a slight twitch of the lips there, all speaking volumes without shouting.\n\nSo, would young Cusack be able to switch gears and give us a compelling young Spock? Well, here's the thing about acting ‚Äì it's all about range. While we've pegged Cusack as the quirky, heart-on-his-sleeve sort of protagonist, that doesn't mean he couldn't rock a calm, calculating demeanor in his repertoire. The key ingredient here would be restraint, a tall order for actors who thrive on emotional expression, but not impossible.\n\nCusack would bring a different energy to the character for sure. Perhaps we'd witness a Spock that's a touch more visibly conflicted on that human-Vulcan teeter-totter, giving us a peek at the simmering passion beneath the cool exterior. Imagine those moments in the Academy or on early spacefaring missions where Spock wrestles with his identity, Cusack could bring a vulnerability to those scenes, offering a fresh angle on Spock's journey to becoming the icon.\n\nIn a hypothetical world where we timewarp and cast young John Cusack as a young Spock, think Portland ‚Äì unusual, a little off the beaten track, but somehow fitting. Perhaps he wouldn‚Äôt embody Spock with the same austere aura as Nimoy, but I bet Cusack‚Äôs take would've been interesting. It would‚Äôve been the Spock that leaned into his human heritage a bit more, giving us a new layer to that internal struggle.\n\nIt's all conjecture, but that's the fun of these what-if scenarios in the world of movies. Like contemplating rain while sitting in a quiet, misty Portland garden, it's the possibilities that stir the imagination."}

Things got so bad that Jones took his ball and went home just before post-production, which would result in much of his dialogue for the film being dubbed over by professional voice and dramatic actor Peter Marinker; whose identity was unknown, even to the main draw of the film Jones.\n\nBut Von Sydow, the master of actor gravitas and versatility, a man who played both Jesus and Satan, really helped carry more than his part of the load in this film with his over the top evil performance. He was the epitome of the 1980s cheese bad guy. With a stereotypical line such as, while referring to his nemesis:\n\n‚Äú'Ahhh‚Ä¶now my victory is complete. With Flash Gordon dead, nothing can stop me from conquering the universe!'\n\nBut somehow the guy made the line and the character work. In a movie filled with most of the characters hamming it up, Von Sydow‚Äôs contribution was, really, the best and most interesting performance.\n\nWhat was also cool about this movie is that Queen did the entire soundtrack. It was the rock band‚Äôs first of two soundtracks that they ever recorded."}

While living off just film royalties for a lifetime is quite rare, several actors have struck gold with specific movies, securing them a comfortable financial cushion for years to come. Here are a few notable examples:\n\n1. Harrison Ford: Remember Han Solo from Star Wars? Ford reportedly negotiated a percentage of the franchise's gross profits, resulting in a massive payday that continues to generate significant royalties. Estimates suggest he's earned over $65 million just from the original trilogy, ensuring his place as one of Hollywood's wealthiest actors.\n\n2. Daniel Radcliffe: The boy who lived also lives pretty comfortably thanks to the Harry Potter series. Radcliffe's upfront salary combined with a percentage of profits from the blockbuster franchise puts him at an estimated net worth of over $100 million. Even though the movies have wrapped, he continues to rake in royalties from reruns, merchandise, and theme park appearances.\n\n3. Tom Hanks: Forrest Gump may have said, \"Life is like a box of chocolates,\" but for Hanks, it's been more like a box of gold coins. His deal for the iconic film included a percentage of the back-end profits, which have reportedly exceeded $40 million so far. Add that to his hefty salaries from other blockbusters like Cast Away and Saving Private Ryan, and Hanks is definitely set for life.\n\n4. Cameron Diaz: While she's taken a step back from acting recently, Diaz's role in There's Something About Mary remains a cash cow. Her savvy contract negotiations secured her a 20% stake in the film's profits, which translated to a staggering $70 million payout. Talk about making a lasting impression!\n\n5. The Cast of Seinfeld: This iconic sitcom keeps on giving for the main cast members, Jerry Seinfeld, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Michael Richards, and Jason Alexander. Thanks to syndication deals and streaming residuals, they each reportedly earn millions of dollars annually, even decades after the show's finale. Not bad for a show about \"nothing\"!\n\nIt's important to note that living solely off film royalties depends on various factors like the movie's success, negotiated contracts, and overall financial management. However, for these lucky actors, their golden cinematic moments have translated into a lifetime of financial security and the freedom to pursue passion projects without financial worries."}
{"date": "2024-01-03-18-23", "error": false, "url": "Is Animal movie worth watching?", "text_blocks": "Is Animal movie worth watching?,'\n',I wrote this as a comment to a different question. Then decided to upgrade it into an answer to a question. I rarely watch Bollywood films, but the interest to watch was spawned out of thin air.\n\nI watched this a couple of days after it was released, in a decent theatre in Tamil Nadu (PSS, Tirunelveli, TN). Honestly speaking some scenes don‚Äôt glue to human logic, I agree, but broadly speaking, the movie rendered a wonderful theatrical experience. By theatrical experience I mean, the ‚ÄúWow feeling‚Äù brought about by the mix of visuals of the landscape, the crystal clear sounds of the background music and some of the beautiful songs, the imposing figure of Ranbir, and the highly manly and ravishingly masculine looks portrayed in some of his life‚Äôs phases, etc. Misogynist elements are there in the film, but I guess the director used them as a gateway to highlight the alpha traits of a male. Traditionally, that is what conjures up when we listen to the ‚Äúalpha male‚Äù buzzword - a male with the abundance of masculinity and charm to sweep a girl/ woman off the carpet and get sex in no time; they make moves and women just follow, I mean women can‚Äôt resist obsessing over them and can‚Äôt stop to kiss them. These are the kinds of information that get disseminated by pick-up guys, movies, media, etc. So Sandeep Reddy Vanga just decorated RB‚Äôs character with those traits, I mean the alpha male stereotype. At the atomic level, the movie revolves around the unhealthy dynamics of a father-son relationship.\n\nFor movie enthusiasts, Animal is a decent film that is worth experiencing in a theater. Without giving away any spoilers, the movie portrays how someone who is starved for fatherly love can turn cold-blooded, even when there is a father who is super busy and ignorant of his kids and family. Imagine craving something so much, but not getting it despite its proximity. You may start acting out, even frenzily, hoping to get it one day. When love is what you crave, but the supply isn't there, you may overdo things to see if there is any change, only to no avail. How frustrating and infuriating is that? What if what you overdo is a bunch of violence and human butchering, all to impress what you find as the vital source of love? That's what I felt about Animal. However, this core essence is coated with layers that you would see if you watched it superficially. The movie also has a layer that flaunts the masculinity, heroism, and handsomeness of the lead actor. The climax, despite its over-dramatic nature, could have been made better, especially by showing the spectators that all the murders happened in India, and none are entitled to do human-slaughtering like the Leatherface in Texas Chainsaw Massacre."}

The censor board gave the movie an A-certificate, but the intimate scenes are nothing but soft-p@rn. Teens and desperate people in our country may like it, but it's a mood-dampener for those who went to the movie halls, specifically for these scenes. The scenes show us that not much has changed in Urduwood since the 1970s.\n\nAnimal has plenty of violence and shocking dialogues, but what is the point in giving it an A-certificate when we have watched most things on OTT? Animal is no different from most Urduwood movies regarding intimate scenes. Only the unfiltered violence, Ranbu‚Äôs acting, and Vanga‚Äôs direction save the day. Some things separate Animal‚Äôs intimate scenes from other Bollywood movies.\n\nProgression: In 70s, 80s, and 90s Urduwood movies, a flower used to appear when the lead actors tried to kiss. After the 2000s, objects like flower vases, curtains, and glass windows hid the body parts. In Animal, the actress uses her hand to cover her body.\nDialogues: In older Urduwood movies, only the villain does such stuff. Ranbir blurs the lines between good and evil. He cheats on his wife and uses strong arguments to defend his acts. Moreover, Vijay controls his feelings even after Zoya tells the truth; he doesn‚Äôt break down like a simp.\nHotter Bhabhi 2: Animal is one of the few movies where the other woman is hotter than the lead actress. Tripti has gained more popularity for her role as Zoya in the movie than Rashmi, who plays Geetanjali.\nNo guilt trip: None of the characters feel guilty after the intimate scene in the movie. They enjoyed the act and took full responsibility for it (unlike earlier movies where the hero and the actress must feel remorse to satisfy the demands of the morality brigade).\nGray Shades: Older Urduwood movies show how the hero can never be bad and that they do such things under the influence of alcohol or other stuff. However, the hero in Animal does it consciously and without any regret.\nFeelings: Regardless of the legality of their relationship, Vijay falls in love with Zoya and offers to marry her. He even orders a Rolls Royce car for her (with the color matching her love bite). Older Urduwood movies show no respect for the other women in the movie.\nEmotional perspective: Some scenes explore the emotional complexities of intimacy, delving into characters' desires, vulnerabilities, and power dynamics. This goes beyond the romanticized or purely sensationalized portrayals of earlier movies.\nFemale Dominance: Some intimate scenes in Animal showcase female characters initiating or driving the encounter rather than solely fulfilling the male gaze. This represents a move towards portraying women with more agency and desire.\nContextual Importance: Intimacy isn't just used for titillation or commercial appeal. In the movie Animal, it is often integrated into the narrative, serving specific character arcs or plot developments.\n\nDuring the scene‚Äôs filming, Ranbu actually asks Tripti if she‚Äôs comfortable. It shows that the industry is changing and that outsiders get some respect (or at least they‚Äôre making efforts). Besides the above points, the intimate scenes are no different from regular Indian movies.\n\nThe hero and the heroine have all the on-screen fun, while the spectators don‚Äôt get to see anything. The credit goes to the cameraman, who keeps the viewers gasping for more but never delivers what they want. It‚Äôs the kind of excitement that most desis crave. The only thing I am curious about is whether Vijay loved Zoya more than Geetanjali.\n\nThey show us everything, but still, we don‚Äôt see anything. Will Animal‚Äôs OTT version give us some more action and erotica? Let‚Äôs wait and watch.\n\nImage Credits - Google"}

This is why its box office collection was barely ‚Çπ65.98 crore, could not reach even ‚Çπ100 crore. If it had mindless high-octane actions, melodramatic or heroic scenes, it would collect at least ‚Çπ200 crore.\n\n* ùó¶ùó£ùó¢ùóúùóüùóòùó• ùóîùóüùóòùó•ùóß:\n\n12th Fail is an inspirational movie for those who not only aspire to qualify for UPSC exams but also for any competitive examination. Its story motivates and creates enthusiasm to dream and prepare for building one's successful future.\n\nThe story revolves around Manoj Kumar Sharma (Vikrant Massey), a 12th class student in Bilgaon village in Chambal, who fails in his first attempt due to unfair exam practices prevalent in the school. After DSP Dushyant Singh advises him to study and pass without copying answers, he follows the path and clears the higher secondary level in the next year.\n\nSubsequently, he also completes his BA degree course.\n\nNext, he aspires to become an incorruptible, honest police officer like Dushyant Singh to stop corruption practices. To achieve it, he needs to appear and qualify in PCS exam.\n\nHe goes to Gwalior to prepare for the exam, where he meets a friend, alongwith whom he goes to Delhi to join coaching.\n\nThe majority of the story is centered around how Manoj faces difficulties and challenges during preparation for the competitive examination. It depicts how he strives to earn and gather funds for preparation. At the same time, he has to look after his family members while studying for the exam.\n\nDuring his coaching and working as a library cleaner, he comes across his future life partner Shraddha Joshi (Medha Shankar), who also aspires to clear the state civil service exam. In between, misunderstandings and confusions happen among them, but they mutually overcome and sort these out.\n\nHe fails in three attempts out of four attempts. However, he persists without losing hope, he prepares more seriously and ultimately qualifies for the Mains exam on the fourth and final attempt. Ultimately, he qualifies in the final personal interview section too and becomes an IPS officer, although it was challenging as a 12th fail (once) and Hindi medium candidate. The movie ends in a wedding ceremony with girlfriend Shraddha.\n\nThe best part of the 12th Fail movie is it has a message that nothing is impossible if one works hard with strong dedication and commitment, not losing hope after several failures. Success awaits to those committed enough to pursue it.\n\nIt also highlights how lakhs of aspirants from different backgrounds come to Delhi every year to prepare for India's toughest competitive examination. Their mental agonies, struggles and commitments are thoroughly portrayed throughout the movie.\n\nOn an interesting note, there are several scenes where ùóóùóø. ùó©ùó∂ùó∏ùóÆùòÄ ùóóùó∂ùòÉùòÜùóÆùó∏ùó∂ùóøùòÅùó∂ can be seen as a teacher in a coaching centre. In real-life, he cracked the UPSC exam in 1st attempt in 1996 at 384 AIR and served as IAS, but left the job in 1999 to start his own ùóóùóøùó∂ùòÄùòÅùóµùó∂ ùóúùóîùó¶ coaching institute.\n\nCertain scenes in the movie remind of Hrithik Roshan in the movie 'Super 30' as well as 'Koi Mil Gaya' because both Vikrant and Hrithik resemble to each other, especially in their smiles.\n\nPersonally, I feel Vikrant Massey stands as a strong contender for the Best Actor award in any film festival for the year 2023. His outstanding performance in this movie is thousand times praiseworthy.\n\nEven director Vidhu Vinod Chopra deserves Best Director award for his excellent and fine direction. It's one of his many masterpiece movies.\n\nPriyanshu Chatterjee has a special appearance as a DSP. His presence is short but appealing."}

It's one of those things that's not just a bold choice in the real world, but also a pretty killer way to make a character in films and TV stand out. Here are some prime examples:\n\nJinx from \"Arcane\"Anyone who's tuned into \"Arcane\" can't forget Jinx. She's the epitome of chaos, with those wild blue eyes and a mane of electric purple hair that just screams 'unpredictable'. Plus, she's got an arsenal of weapons and a backstory that‚Äôll break your heart. She's a piece of work, but the hair makes her unforgettable.\nRamona Flowers from \"Scott Pilgrim vs. The World\"Ramona's hair is like a mood ring. It changes color faster than the seasons here in Portland. Her purple phase is just as significant as her green, blue, or red hair, reflecting the myriad phases of her ever-evolving character. Plus, she's got the whole \"mysterious girl with a past\" thing down pat.\nHit-Girl from \"Kick-Ass\"This pint-sized vigilante, with her spunky and, frankly, brutal approach to fighting crime, rocks a vivid purple bob that‚Äôs as much a part of her superhero persona as her propensity to... well, kick ass. Not exactly the type of superhero we get roaming in Portland, but she‚Äôs fun to watch from the safety of the couch.\nLeela from \"Futurama\"Even cyclops need love and Leela doesn't disappoint. Her distinctive one-eyed visage is perfectly complemented by that purple ponytail. She may not be your conventional silver-screen beauty, but she adds a dash of normalcy to the outlandish future where she resides.\nRaven from \"Teen Titans\"Dark, moody, and mystical, Raven's whole aesthetic is something out of a goth phase, but with real supernatural powers. That purple hair plays into her look, giving her just a tinge of softness in an otherwise hard-edged character.\nSpike from \"My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic\"What list of characters with purple hair could be complete without mentioning Spike? Okay, he‚Äôs not human, but his purple and green color scheme screams 'adorable' in a world of magical, friendship-spouting ponies.\n\nTo top it all off, purple hair isn't just a stylistic choice. It often adds layers to a character's identity, hinting at their uniqueness, their otherworldliness, or sometimes their inner turmoil. Whether it's a symbol of their rebellion against societal norms or a reflection of their quirks, in the end, these characters are given something special with just a touch of the violet.\n\nAnd hey, it's so much more than a hair color‚Äîit's a personality trait. Whether you find such flamboyant stylings walking the streets of Portland or on the silver screen, one thing's for sure: characters with purple hair never fail to leave a lasting impression."}

Cinema is a powerful medium with which we correlate a lot. Some films are so inspirational that they leave an everlasting positive impact on people‚Äôs lives. Everyone loves heroes. But there are some negative characters from whom the fans take a very wrong kind of inspiration.\n\n1 - Drishyam\n\nDrishyam is an amazing and intelligent thriller film. In the film, the lead actor takes inspiration from the movies and hides a dead body. The police cannot uncover the crime. A similar incident has happened in Indore. A politician Jagdish Karotiya killed a girl and threw the remains in a sewer. The accused called the municipal asking for permission to dig a put on his plot. He needed to bury a dog. Police reached the spot after receiving this information. When they started digging, they found a dog‚Äôs carcass. This was done intentionally to mislead the police. The accused took the inspiration from the film Drishyam to fool the police.\n\n2 - Bunty and Babli\n\nIn ‚ÄúBunty and Babli‚Äù, Abhishek and Rani play the roles of con artists who fool people and get money out of them to support their lavishing lifestyle. Many couples who were inspired by this film committed crimes. In Delhi, a husband-wife fooled some people, they got their money and ran away. When they were arrested in 2013, they revealed in the interrogation to the police that they took inspiration from the movie. After releasing from jail, this couple started conning people in different cities. You would not believe they have a total of 23 cases pending on them. Bunty (Jagmeet) has been arrested, but the Babli is still absconding.\n\n3 - Khosla Ka Ghosla\n\nThe film tells the story of a middle-class common man whose property gets taken over by a corrupt property dealer by fake documents. In Delhi, many people were sold the property in a similar fashion. Some people claiming to be the members of DDA went up to the people, telling them that they are selling the govt plots at very cheap rates. People seeing fake documents would pay them a handsome amount for token money. Later when people realized that they became victims of fraud, they reported it to the authority and the fake dealers were caught. Police revealed that the group operated in a similar way as depicted in the film ‚ÄúKhosla Ka Ghosla‚Äù.\n\n4 - Khalnayak\n\nSanjay Dutt has played the most number of gangster roles. Many people took inspiration from his characters and even committed crimes. A UP ma named Nadeem AKA Billu Sanda took serious inspiration from Sunjay Dutt‚Äôs film ‚ÄúKhalnayak‚Äù and modeled himself after the character. He said he wants to become a don. He challenged the police that he will escape from jail.\n\n5 - Special 26\n\n‚ÄúSpecial 26‚Äù is based on the infamous 1987 Opera House heist where a group of people posed as CBI officers who did an income tax raid and ran away with 30-35 lakh worth of cash and jewelry. After the release of this film, many similar heists were reported. A case was found in Maharashtra in which some fake CBI officers stole around Rs 21 lakh from a businessman. After getting arrested, they revealed that they were inspired by the film ‚ÄúSpecial 26‚Äù and re-watched the movie before executing their fake raid.\n\nOne more similar case happened in Hyderabad where some people pretended to be CBI officers and entered into the Muthoot Finance bank and said they got a tip that a customer has deposited gold in their bank purchased with black money. They did it so professionally that they sent a fake Traffic cop in the bank before their arrival who purposely informed the bank that a CBI team is coming to do a raid. They took around 40kg gold from the bank."}

This is what good actors do as they know when to stop or say no.\n\nNow, the 2017 movie Logan is set in the year 2029. This is a timeline where there are no mutants born since 25 years. Transigen Corporation is hunting mutants for their genetics.\n\nWolverine is shown old as his healing is not as good as it used to be. Due to this the very Adamantium that he used as a weapon is now killing him from the inside.\n\nThe movie doesn‚Äôt dive into the details of why Wolverine lost his healing. But there‚Äôs an easter egg for this. The farmer with which Wolverine and Laura stay tells that mutants lost their abilities because of corn syrup.\n\nWhat happened is Dr Zander Rice, found out a way to isolate the X-gene in mutants which was responsible for the mutation. When the X-gene was isolated, it couldn‚Äôt mutate and so the mutants couldn‚Äôt exist as the gene couldn‚Äôt provide any powers.\n\nHaving made this virus Rice with the help of Transigen Corporation manufactured high-fructose corn syrup. He then added the virus which could isolate the X-gene to the corn syrup.\n\nCorn syrup was used an additive for cereal and energy drinks globally which saw the end of mutants.\n\nWolverine was no exception to this virus, as the food he was consuming weakened his healing factor.\n\nHence, Wolverine was written in a way that could give his character a satisfying end."}

He was married to his second wife Maria Langham but didn‚Äôt allow that technicality to interfere with his philandering. He was well-known on the M-G-M lot for rutting his way through female contract players, and did so with energetic abandon. He was also a regular client of upscale Hollywood brothels.\n\nIf you want to know what Hollywood was (and is) like in the ways of sex, read ‚ÄúGrowing up in Hollywood‚Äù by director Robert Parrish, ‚ÄúThe Moon‚Äôs A Balloon‚Äù by David Niven, ‚ÄúMy Wicked, Wicked Ways‚Äù by Errol Flynn. You‚Äôll get a taste of the satyr-like behavior of many of Hollywood‚Äôs Chosen Few. (Note: Mr. Niven leaves out of his autobiography the running around he did behind first wife Primula‚Äôs back. But since he depicted the first Mrs. Niven as a loving angel, it was probably a wise move.)\n\nAddendum: Since the question has come up regarding unwanted pregnancies, Golden Age studios had a solution for pesky things like that: Classic Hollywood‚Äôs Secret: Studios Wanted Their Stars to Have Abortions"}
