In a Nov. 30 Instagram reel, Kiyosaki elaborated on his debt philosophy, highlighting a critical distinction between assets and liabilities.He said many people use debt to buy liabilities, while he uses debt to purchase assets. To illustrate his approach, Kiyosaki said his luxury vehicles, like a Ferrari and a Rolls Royce, are fully paid off, categorizing them as liabilities rather than assets.In the reel, Kiyosaki also expressed skepticism toward saving cash, referencing the U.S. dollar’s detachment from the gold standard in 1971 under President Richard Nixon. Instead of saving cash, he saves gold and converts his earnings into silver and gold. This strategy, according to Kiyosaki, has led to an accumulation $1.2 billion in debt, an amount he admits to. He says he is in debt because “if I go bust, the bank goes bust. Not my problem.”Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here are 3 high-yield investments to add significant income to your portfolio.His approach involves using debt strategically to enhance wealth. Kiyosaki categorizes debt into good debt and bad debt, with good debt being that which helps build wealth, such as loans used for acquiring income-generating assets like real estate, businesses or investments. He advocates using debt as leverage in investments, particularly in real estate, seeing it as an effective way to ride market fluctuations and capitalize on opportunities.Kiyosaki’s investment strategy is multifaceted. He is known for his stance against fiat money, labeling it in derogatory terms and instead advocating for investment in what he calls “real assets” like Bitcoin, silver, gold and Wagyu cattle. Bitcoin, in particular, is a favorite of his, perceived as a hedge against the deteriorating value of the U.S. dollar. Kiyosaki views gold, another key component of his portfolio, as more stable and reliable than cash, which he calls “trash\" because he just doesn't \"trust the frickin' dollar.\"  He has expressed a willingness to increase his gold holdings even if prices drop significantly.Silver, too, forms a significant part of his investment strategy. He views it as a long-term investment, particularly because of its increasing rarity and relatively lower price compared to gold. Real estate remains a cornerstone of his investments, valued for its dual benefits of rental income and capital appreciation. His investment in Wagyu cattle, a less conventional asset, reflects his belief in diversifying his portfolio beyond traditional investments.Kiyosaki’s approach to debt and investment is rooted in a broader perspective on finance and wealth. He views money as a form of debt or obligation, a tool that can be used for acquiring assets and generating wealth. His philosophy emphasizes education in finance, suggesting that people should be well-informed about financial matters.While Kiyosaki's methods have been successful for him, they come with risks, as illustrated by his past financial troubles, including filing for bankruptcy in 2012 after a legal dispute over royalties.Elon Musk has reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land just outside of Austin. Here’s how to invest in the city’s growth before he floods it with new tech workers.Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class.

By 2020, he had scaled his way up to a salary of $133,000, with benefits bringing him up to an annual salary of over $272,000, according to California state archives viewed by Insider.While his career set him up for financial stability, his weekly working hours could range from 60 to 100 hours.\"I didn't have any personal freedom,\" Alex said.  \"I was neglecting my personal life. I wasn't hanging around my family who I love. I'm a big family guy. And at the end of the day, I realized, this can't be life.\"The deeper realization that a salaried career wasn't going to be his future was during periods when overtime was paused, which would cut his pay drastically, he said. Some months, his biweekly paycheck would be $2,000 after deductions. This meant he always had to save for those low months to cover his bills, which could range from $5,000 to $6,000 a month, he said.\"What really was a morale killer was the fact that you want to move ahead in life. And I feel it kept you static when that happened,\" Alex said.He decided that investing in cash-flowing assets would be a way out of the paycheck volatility. He could then use his salary for discretionary purchases such as vacations, cars, and additional investments.He initially considered real estate but felt that it would require a lot of cash and a mortgage that would create more debt. Plus, he believed that the overhead expenses of maintaining a property would add to his stress. He'd have to hold any rental income in cash in case he had to cover the mortgage due to missed rent or repairs.In 2017, Alex came across the idea of investing in ATMs through a colleague who had been researching the business. He began joining social media groups about it,  watching YouTube videos from others who had done it, and reading any material he could.It was a business model that was out of his comfort zone because he knew nothing about it. But the draw of it was that it had a low-cost barrier to start; relative to buying real estate, an ATM could cost less than $3,000. It also had lower risk because if the ATM wasn't generating a return, he could relocate the machine, which he refers to as a floating asset. And finally, it was a quick way of starting a side hustle because once a machine was placed on location, it could start generating a profit almost immediately. Alex decided to pursue it as a side hustle in 2018. By March 2021, he had left the police force and made it his full-time job where he provides the ATMs for those who also want to embark on this business.From January 2021 to April 2023, Alex's profit and loss statements viewed by Insider show a total sales of $12 million and a net profit of about $3.5 million for his company ATMTogether, a provider of ATM machines and services. His company Merchant Task Force, which provides credit-card terminals, shows an income of $844,000 and a net profit of $742,000 for the same period.In 2018, Alex took two weeks off from work and used that time to scout the city for ideal locations.He looked for high-traffic areas that had an incentive to have an ATM on site. This included tourist areas and city spots that were populated with nightclubs, restaurants, and valets to target zones where staff was tipped. He also looked for small businesses that offered cash back at checkouts, which was a nuisance to the business because they had to be sure there would always be enough dollar bills in the register.Alex would pitch the businesses as though he was offering a service. He would be responsible for providing and maintaining the machine at no charge to them. He recalled cold calling over a hundred businesses and physically walking into over 20 locations.\"When I started this and I had gone out there and I was getting nos and yeses, wins and losses, It was very difficult for me to go back to work and not think about my business. And I think that's what caught me, was just the fact that I was growing something for myself and I wanted to continue to grow it.\"He initially had the idea of starting with three ATMs but by the time he was done, he was able to secure six locations: three liquor stores, two barber shops, and one nail salon in the San Francisco Bay Area. The first three were incentivized by cashback and the last three by cash tips.Once the machines arrived on location, he loaded each ATM up with about $2,000 to $3,000 in cash.Not every location was a grand slam. Alex noted that a decent minimum return on an ATM should be at least $200 a month per machine. Within the first month, Alex could already tell that the only three machines producing a return were the ones he placed at the liquor stores. They had a net profit of about $250 to $500 a month per location from fees charged for withdrawals. In contrast, the lower traffic locations were only producing $25 to $100 a month. He let the machines sit for two months before deciding it was time to move them.Alex also found a mentor from Facebook who was successful in the business. Based on his mentor's advice, he moved the three machines to two convenience stores and another liquor store. From there, they began to bring a net profit almost immediately, with the highest return being $600 a month, he said. He suddenly had six operational machines that brought in roughly $3,000 a month in net profit, he said. It took him approximately six months to get a return on his investment.While Alex had enough cash saved to purchase the machines, he realized he would need the bills to stock the ATMs. So instead, he signed up for two personal credit cards and used them to buy the hardware, he said. They were cards that specifically offered zero-interest for the first 12 months, he noted. This would give him enough time to create cash flow without incurring interest every month.When he purchased his first set of six machines, Alex assumed he got a good discount, which was $2,100 an ATM. He would later realize it was a bad deal because it required him to pay a 30% commission from the fees his ATMs charged. While the sales agent he worked with told him it was standard practice, he later realized it wasn't the only way.The next set of machines would be purchased from his mentor. They were both new and refurbished and cost between $1,800 to $2,200 depending on the model.Additional costs for the ATMs included an internet wireless modem for $150, a monthly internet charge of $6.99, and installation by a technician of $300.Alex would gradually use the profits from his ATMs to buy more machines. And by 2020, he had accumulated 30 ATMs across the San Francisco Bay area that were operative. Each brought in anywhere from $250 to as much as $1,500 a month in net profit.Altogether, these little assets cash flowed anywhere between $9,000 to $12,000 a month in net profit, he said. While his side hustle didn't make up for his salary, he was fully able to cover his bills with the profits. This was enough to make him want to leave his job in 2021 to build a business in this sector.During this time, he met an ATM provider who he partnered with and they scaled to become a provider of ATMs. This allowed him to sell off his machines so that he could become remote.Even while in the act of building his side hustle, Alex still had doubts running through his mind. The chatter from those around him kept him questioning his ability to carry this through. Some of his colleagues thought it was a bad idea to invest in an unknown business and told him he should just pick up extra hours instead. In hindsight, he's glad he kept going.\"Invest in yourself. Self-education is everything,\" Alex said reflecting on his journey. \"All this started from a friend of mine, giving me an idea, and then me taking that idea and doing my due diligence and just researching it, buying books, watching videos, reading, reading, reading to the point where I was comfortable enough to execute it on my own.\"This story was originally published in June 2023.Read the original article on Business Insider"}

Or maybe they suddenly find themselves in need of financial assistance and turn to you for help.Fortunately, the IRS allows you to give away a certain amount of assets – from real estate and stocks to cold hard cash – free of taxes every year. In 2024, you can give away up to $18,000 to an individual and not have to pay taxes on the transfer. In fact, you’ll only trigger taxes in 2024 if you’ve given away more than $13.61 million throughout your life.Understanding the ins and outs of strategic gifting can be important, especially for the wealthy. Speak with a financial advisor today.A gift is any unilateral transfer of money or property. This means that you give someone assets without receiving either fair value or any value in return. The term \"fair value\" applies to when you give someone an asset in exchange for payment significantly below its market price. It applies to any kind of transaction so, for example, giving someone real estate, a low-interest loan or access to an income stream would all apply. The classic gift is to simply give someone cash while receiving nothing in return.There are several exceptions to what the IRS considers a taxable gift. For example, money given to a claimed dependent does not constitute a gift, nor does paying someone's tuition. However, outside defined exceptions, any unilateral or below-market transfer is considered a gift.When you make someone a large enough gift, it becomes taxable. The IRS taxes applicable gifts at between 18% and 40% depending on the size of the transfer. You, as the gift giver, pay this tax. Due to the gift tax's exemptions, it also generally applies only to the very wealthy. But if you need additional help navigating and planning for the gift tax, consider working with a financial advisor.Broadly speaking, the purpose of the gift tax is to prevent people from avoiding estate taxes by simply giving away all their money before they die. As a result, the gift tax only applies to transfers that exceed two fairly high caps.The first cap is called the annual exclusion. This is the amount of money that you can give away every year without triggering the tax. The annual exclusion is set on a per-recipient basis, meaning that it applies separately to each person to whom you give a gift, and there is no limit to the number of people you can give gifts to under this exemption. In 2023, the annual exclusion limit was $17,000 for individuals and $34,000 for married couples. In 2024, it increases to $18,000 and $36,000, respectively.The second cap is called the lifetime exemption. This is the amount of money that you can give away throughout your lifetime – and after your death – without triggering either gift or estate taxes. The lifetime exemption is set on a per-donor basis, meaning that all of your gifts/estate collectively apply. It also increases each year, so that even if you have already met the lifetime exemption, each year you can give a little bit more away without triggering any taxes. In 2023, the lifetime exemption was set at $12.92 million for individuals, which allows married couples to give away up to $25.84. In 2024, the lifetime exemption will increase to $13.61 million for individuals and $27.22 million for married couples.Giving a gift together, as a married couple, is referred to as \"gift-splitting.\" It allows you to take the doubled exemption rates, but both spouses must consent to the gift and claim it on their tax returns. Either way, whenever you give someone a gift worth more than the annual exclusion you must file Form 709 with your taxes the year after you make the transfer. So, for example, if you give someone $25,000 in 2024, you would file Form 709 with your tax year 2024 forms in 2025.Whether you want to make a small financial gift or a large one, talking it through with a financial advisor first can potentially help you avoid unexpected tax bills.So let's look at how the gift tax applies if you’re hoping to give money to your daughter and her spouse:Let’s say you’re single and looking to give them a generous financial gift in 2024. You would be able gift a total of $36,000 – $18,000 to your daughter and $18,000 to her spouse – without having to pay taxes on the gifts.However, you can still give them more than the $18,000 exclusion limit. Any individual gift that exceeds this annual cap simply counts against your lifetime exemption. So, if you gave them $60,000 in 2024, your gifts would be $24,000 over the annual exclusion. This would lower your lifetime exemption from $13.61 million to $13.586 million.In theory, you could give your daughter and her spouse $36,000 in 2024, and transfer up to $13.61 million in additional assets without having to worry about the gift tax. As a result, you could potentially give them up to $13.646 million in 2024 if your entire exemption was intact.But don't forget that the annual exemption renews every year. If you choose, you can create a structured gift that gives your daughter and son-in-law the annual maximum each year indefinitely. You can also top up your gift with each year's lifetime exemption update.However, if you need guidance on how much you’re eligible to gift, consider connecting with a financial advisor using SmartAsset’s free matching tool.The amount that you can gift someone tax-free will depend on how much you have given them this past year and how much you have gifted in total over your lifetime. The IRS allows you to give $17,000 to as many recipients as you want in 2023 and $18,000 in 2024. Gifts that exceed the annual exclusion count against your lifetime exemption limit, which rises to $13.61 million in 2024 from $12.92 million in 2023.A financial advisor can help you manage your assets and organize them within your estate plan. Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be hard. SmartAsset's free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If you're ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.If you’re especially wealthy, gifting assets throughout your life is a tax-savvy way to reduce the size of your estate and avoid the federal estate tax when you die.Photo credit: ©iStock.com/skynesher, ©iStock.com/designer491, ©iStock.com/andresrThe post I Want to Give Money to My Daughter and Son-in-Law.

{"date": "2024-01-03-16-39", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/average-retirement-savings-baby-boomers-125500443.html", "text_blocks": "The Baby Boomer generation is reaching retirement age in record numbers. With more Boomers retiring on a daily basis, it helps to understand how prepared they are to leave their jobs for good. In this article, we’ll discuss the average retirement savings for Baby Boomers, and provide tips for how to boost retirement income.Regardless of which generation you belong to, a financial advisor can help you get ready for retirement.Average Retirement Savings for Baby BoomersAccording to the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies, the estimated median retirement savings for Baby Boomer is $202,000. Based on the 4% Rule, this would yield an annual retirement income of $8,000 per year. Depending on your perspective, this portfolio size could be more or less than you expected. Transamerica also found that about 45% of Baby Boomers have saved $250,000 or more. Further, 40% of Boomers agree with the statement that they have not done enough to save for retirement.A study by the Stanford Center on Longevity found that people born from 1948 to 1953 had a median balance in tax-advantaged plans of $290,000, while those born from 1954 to 1959 had a median balance of $209,246 in their tax-advantaged plans.One item that puts this in perspective is that the Boomer generation was the last to have widespread access to workplace pensions. With expected retirement income from pensions, many Boomers didn’t feel the need to save as much as succeeding generations.Additionally, for Boomers who are still working, this number should continue to rise as they make additional annual contributions and their investments grow. If you use the Rule of 72, the youngest Boomers could expect to have one last “doubling” of their retirement nest egg with average returns of 8% to 10% before they reach 67.How Baby Boomers Can Increase Retirement IncomeRetirement income is an important topic for people close to retirement age. These steps are simple ways to boost the average savings retirement savings for Boomers. For each strategy that you are able to implement, you’ll increase your potential retirement income.Maximize Retirement PlansBy contributing the maximum every year to your retirement plans, you’ll create a larger nest egg to withdraw from in retirement. Additionally, if you contribute to pretax retirement plans (like a 401(k), 403(b), or 457 Plan), you’ll reduce your tax bill every year providing extra money to invest. For 2022 you are allowed to contribute up to $20,500 in these plans.Conversely, by contributing to post-tax retirement plans like a Roth IRA, you’re creating tax-free income in retirement. These plans do not have required minimum distributions starting at age 72, so this tax-free money can continue to grow for many years. You can add up to $6,000 per year (2022 annual limit) to your Roth IRA, depending on your income.Catch-up Contributions For Savers Over 50When you reach age 50, you’re allowed to make “catch up” contributions to your retirement accounts. This means that you can add an additional $6,500 to your company retirement plans and another $1,000 to your IRA (Traditional or Roth). These catch-up provisions help you boost your retirement savings in the final years before retirement. The more you are able to put away, the larger your nest egg will grow and produce monthly income in retirement.If you’re ready to be matched with local advisors that can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.Use a Brokerage AccountWhen you’ve maxed out your retirement savings, investing through a brokerage account is a good idea. There are no contribution limits or withdrawal rules to worry about. While most retirement plans have limited choices, you have infinitely more investment options to choose from in a brokerage account.Brokerage accounts can also help with your tax planning strategies since you can pick and choose which assets to sell. For example, you can benefit from capital losses that offset an unlimited amount of capital gains and up to $3,000 of ordinary income each year. And when you sell winning investments after holding them for longer than one year, those profits are taxed at lower capital gains rates.Use a Health Savings AccountA health savings account offers triple tax benefits. Your contributions are tax-deductible each year when paired with a high-deductible health insurance plan. The money grows tax-deferred while it is inside the account. And your withdrawals are tax-free when used for eligible medical expenses, including Medicare premiums. Plus, there are no required minimum distribution requirements so the money can continue to grow and cover future medical expenses in retirement.Purchase an AnnuityAnnuities are another investment option that provides tax-deferred growth for your investments. These insurance products provide returns that mimic a variety of assets, including fixed income and the stock market. Equity-index annuities offer the best of both worlds. It offers guarantees similar to fixed income, but the potential to earn more with participation in the stock market.When you need retirement income, you can withdraw as needed or annuitize your balance for guaranteed income like a pension. The monthly annuity payments are a combination of principal and interest. Your principal is returned tax-free. However, you must report all interest on your tax returns.Cash-Value Life InsuranceBuying a cash-value life insurance policy allows you to purchase a death benefit to protect your loved ones with the ability to invest additional cash. As your cash balance increases, it has the potential to increase your death benefit for your beneficiaries. Additionally, you may be able to withdraw the cash tax-free when taken as a loan. When you pass away, the unpaid balance is deducted from your death benefit.Delay Taking Social SecurityThe full retirement age for people born between 1943 and 1954 is 66. And everyone born after that, it is age 67. For every year that you delay taking Social Security, your monthly benefit increases by 8%. While it can be tempting to take the guaranteed money today by starting Social Security early, waiting can be very lucrative.If you are able to until 70, you’re guaranteeing a 32% increase in the monthly benefit. This extra income is yours for the rest of your life. This extra money also impacts anyone getting survivor benefits. For people who have a long life expectancy, this additional money really adds up.Baby Boomers, DefinedThe Baby Boomer generation is the nickname given to people born between 1946 and 1964. This generation covers more than 20 years of births and most people assume that it’s a homogenous group of people. However, there is actually quite a lot of variety in the ages, personalities, experiences, and goals for Boomers.Common thinking is that you’ve reached retirement age when you turn 65 years old. However, that isn’t always the case. Social Security considers age 66 full retirement for people born between 1943 and 1954, and age 67 for everyone born after that. Plus, modern advances in medicine and nutrition help people live longer and enjoy healthier lives well beyond conventional thinking. For example, the last two U.S. presidents and numerous members of Congress, the Supreme Court, and CEOs of major corporations are all over the age of 65.The first Boomers born in 1946 reached 66 in 2012, yet the last Boomers won’t hit full retirement age until 2031. Many Boomers continue to work because they enjoy the challenge, while some have to because they didn’t save enough. Others retire based on the growth of their net worth thanks to all-time highs in the stock market and housing values.The Bottom LineThe average retirement savings for Baby Boomers is just over $200,000. Since the last Boomers won’t retire until 2031, there is still plenty of time to boost their retirement savings. By contributing to retirement plans and using other accounts, they can use their peak earning years to sock away additional money. This enables market returns and ongoing contributions to maximize their nest egg and the income that it produces. For a personalized recommendation, we suggest speaking with a financial advisor to create your retirement plan.Tips for Maximizing Retirement IncomeIn order to maximize your retirement income from your portfolio, you need to grow your investments.

Apple is rated at hold or better by 40 out of 44 Wall Street forecasters, according to data provided to the Wall Street Journal by FactSet. But Long said that iPhone 15 sales have been “lackluster”—particularly in China, which has reportedly banned government officials from using Apple’s flagship product due to security concerns. He also expects sales of the iPhone 16, which is set to be released in September, to be weaker than expected. “We see no features or upgrades that are likely to make the iPhone 16 more compelling,” he wrote.While Barclays’ downgrade may have sparked Apple’s stock price drop Tuesday, there are several other factors putting the company under pressure. For one, after Apple shares jumped nearly 50% last year, investors might be reallocating some capital away from the company in the new year. “The new year brings tax-motivated postponed gain-taking and repositioning by portfolio managers,” Louis Navellier, founder and chairman of Navellier & Associates, told Bloomberg Tuesday.Apple’s decline also coincides with wider weakness in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. The index sank 1.6% on Tuesday, with investors digesting the potential impact of rising geopolitical tensions amid the Israel-Hamas war and Houthi rebel attacks on ships carrying freight in the Red Sea, a critical trade route. Surging oil prices and broken supply chains because of conflict in the Middle East could lead inflation to be stickier than previously anticipated, which might force the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates high, weighing on growth-focused tech stocks.There have also been warning signs about waning iPhone demand for some time—and that’s critical given that iPhone sales made up nearly 50% of Apple’s total revenue in the third quarter of 2023.UBS analyst David Vogt, who holds a neutral rating and $190 price target for Apple, warned in a Monday note that iPhone 15 sales have been “soft” in many key regions lately, including China and India.Vogt explained that U.S. iPhone sales to end customers (called sell-through) fell almost 13% from a year ago in November, while China sales were down 6% over the same period. This led Apple to lose 50 basis points of global smartphone market share year over year in November, and 320 basis points of smartphone market share in China over the same period. “New competition is a challenge,” Vogt said of the data.Regulatory challenges to Apple’s app store in the U.S. and EU are also weighing on investor sentiment. Apple’s $85 billion services business could face pressure due to a U.S. antitrust trial that revealed, among other things, Google pays tens of billions a year to maintain its standing as the default search engine on Apple’s devices.“In 2024…some app store investigations could intensify,” Long wrote Monday, noting that the U.S. court’s decision over Google’s payments to Apple will come later this year.As Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, told the Financial Times last week, investors may have been ignoring antitrust risks in recent years, but as a number of high-profile cases wind their way through the courts, antitrust is no longer just “noise in the background.”“I think investors should take it seriously,” he warned.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com"}

These other accounts types could include 403(b)s and 457(b)s. If signed into law, this proposal could change the way Roth accounts are managed by their owners.Do you have questions about building a comprehensive retirement plan? Speak with a financial advisor who serves your area today.The aim of the proposed law, sponsored by U.S. Representatives Darin LaHood (R-IL) and Linda T. Sanchez (D-CA), is to allow workers to combine their Roth assets into a workplace Roth account, such as a Roth 401(k), Roth 403(b), or Roth 457(b). This is designed to help eliminate the fees and hassles of tracking multiple investment accounts, as well as simplify the management and monitoring of those investments by getting them all in one place.\"Our bipartisan bill will allow for the consolidation of assets, reduce the potential for duplicative fees and bolster retirement savings for families across the country,\" LaHood said in a statement. If approved, the legislation would mean that \"Retirement savers can roll over and boost their retirement savings, ultimately allowing them to enjoy a comfortable retirement in the future,\" Sanchez added.Roth IRAs are individual retirement accounts where workers can invest after-tax money for retirement and withdraw any subsequent gains tax-free at specific times. In 2024, Roth account holders can contribute up to $7,000 if they're younger than 50 and another $1,000 (for a total of $8,000) if they're 50 or older.Roth IRAs are particularly well-suited for younger workers who are likely to pay taxes in a lower bracket early in their careers, but end up in a higher bracket when they retire. Roth accounts also allow account holders who are at least 59.5 years old to withdraw contributions after five years without any penalty. This can make them a financial backstop to an emergency fund and other savings.Workplace Roth accounts, such as the common 401(k), offer some of the best features of both the Roth IRA and standard workplace 401(k). Like a Roth IRA, the worker's contributions to the plan are made with after-tax money so that all subsequent investment gains can be withdrawn tax-free in retirement.An employer can also match or partially match the worker's contribution, but that money goes into a traditional tax-deferred 401(k), where both contributions and gains are taxed when withdrawn. That allows workers to balance both taxable and tax-deferred withdrawals in retirement, helping them manage their tax bills more completely.Perhaps the biggest boon of a Roth 410(k) is that it drops the smaller IRA contribution limits and uses the much higher 401(k) limit, which in 2024 is $23,000, plus an additional contribution of $7,500 if you are 50 or older. Workers also can take loans against their current employer's Roth 401(k) plan, but not against their own Roth IRA or one in the plan of a former employer.Being able to combine all types of Roth accounts can help eliminate what retirement experts call \"leakage\" when workers change employers. Workers can lose track of several small accounts at previous employers, especially if those companies are purchased or go out of business. In addition, many workers are tempted to cash out old, small balance accounts, which triggers taxes and penalties if they're younger than 59.5. This ultimately leaves them with less money to grow for their retirement.Workers who leave a job and don't have a new plan to roll over an old Roth 401(k) or similar account typically are advised to roll the balance into their own Roth IRA in order to make managing the money easier.Maintaining several Roth accounts – or any of the many other types of retirement investments – can mean paying extra plan fees and finding it harder to properly diversify and manage your investments. Not to mention, you can completely lose track of an old account and miss out on that money.A financial advisor can help you build a plan for retirement.

{"date": "2024-01-03-16-39", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/buy-shiba-inu-while-still-111500151.html", "text_blocks": "Even though the Shiba Inu (CRYPTO: SHIB) token is down roughly 88% from its all-time high, the cryptocurrency is still up massively. The popular meme coin gained 18,600,000% from its low shortly after its launch in 2020.With Shiba Inu currently trading at roughly $0.00001 per token, the coin could reach a price of $0.01 per token if it were to rise 99,000%. If the cryptocurrency were to deliver that kind of performance, investors who purchased $1,000 worth of the token would see their position grow to be worth more than $990,000.But could Shiba Inu really hit a price of $0.01 per token?Posting a gain of 99,000% might not seem like an impossible proposition, given that Shiba Inu has fallen dramatically from its high and has a record of posting much bigger percentage gains in the past. But it's important to keep in mind that relative growth becomes much harder to deliver with larger numbers.Currently, Shiba Inu has a market capitalization of roughly $6.2 billion and a circulating supply of roughly 589 trillion tokens. At a price of $0.01 per token, the cryptocurrency would have a market capitalization of $5.89 trillion.For comparison, Bitcoin had a market capitalization of $1.28 trillion at its valuation peak. At a price of $0.01 per token, Shiba Inu's market cap would need to be 4.6 times the peak valuation of Bitcoin, the token that has always had the largest market cap in the cryptocurrency universe.Hitting a price of a penny per token is an incredibly tall order for Shiba Inu and would require an almost impossible performance. But it is possible that the token could climb higher this year and beyond.While the Shiba Inu has plunged precipitously from its high and has fallen in the crypto-market-cap rankings, the fact that the price didn't evaporate amid the depths of cryptocurrency winter in 2022 suggests that crypto has some staying power. If last year's rally in the broader crypto market continues in 2024, it's reasonable to expect that Shiba Inu could record some solid gains. There's at least one good reason to think that could happen.Many investors and analysts now expect that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in 2024. Doing so would make borrowing money less expensive and would be a major catalyst for cryptocurrencies, growth stocks, and other speculative investments.It's also possible that projects including the Shibarium Layer-2 solution for transaction processing and SHIB: The Metaverse -- a virtual world where participants can buy real estate or play games -- could increase adoption of the Shiba Inu token. As it stands right now, these projects seem unlikely to provide major positive pricing catalysts for the token in 2024, but there is a chance they will go on to exceed expectations and drive bullish sentiment for the cryptocurrency.Shiba Inu is a cryptocurrencythat operates on the Ethereum blockchain. Outside of being a speculative asset and with almost no use as a currency, there isn't much to distinguish it from many other cryptos. There are already more than 23,000 cryptocurrencies for investors to choose from, and the ease of launching new tokens means that new digital assets are joining the fray all the time.It's fairly easy to create a cryptocurrency that solely functions as a currency or a speculative asset these days. Building a network that attracts an active community and continues to evolve is much more difficult. There are signs that the Shiba Inu team is making efforts to support the long-term viability of the token, but its status as a well-known meme coin will probably remain its biggest competitive advantage for the foreseeable future.There's no denying that Shiba Inu has put up stellar returns since its inception, but I generally think that cryptocurrencies that are tied to useful applications have better chances of long-term success. That doesn't mean the coin isn't capable of delivering significant gains from current pricing levels, but investors should understand that it is a very speculative, high-risk investment.Should you invest $1,000 in Shiba Inu right now?Before you buy stock in Shiba Inu, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Shiba Inu wasn't one of them.

{"date": "2024-01-03-16-39", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/goldman-sachs-predicts-2024-turnaround-100502395.html", "text_blocks": "The crystal balls are cloudy, and the energy sector is difficult to predict for 2024. Conventional wisdom says, ‘Oil is going higher;’ after all, there is a war in the Middle East. But neither Israel nor Hamas exports oil, and prices are down from a mid-October spike.The conflicted headwinds of the energy sector, and the oil industry especially, have put heavy pressure on energy stocks in recent months. Even the current war in the Middle East only caused a brief spike in prices, and the OPEC+ group’s efforts to pare back production have simply provided a floor in the current environment – they have not pushed prices back toward recent high levels.The wild card here is a possible US recession. If one hits in 2024, that could crimp oil demand – but we may also see a Fed rate cut, which could in turn goose a call for more oil.For Goldman analyst Neil Mehta, however, this confused environment equals opportunity. He sees a strong chance for several energy stocks to make a 2024 turnaround. “As we make the turn into 2024, we continue to screen for companies with turnaround and mean reversion potential in a mid-cycle $80/b Brent and $3.50/MMBtu Henry Hub environment,” the 5-star analyst recently wrote. “Amid a tougher year for Energy equities, there has been significant differentiation in stock performance across sub-sectors.”Moving forward, Mehta sees opportunity in specific names and is bullish on the prospects of two major energy stocks that have underperformed over the past year. We ran them through the TipRanks database to see what makes them stand out. Here’s the lowdown.Schlumberger Limited (SLB)For the first, we’ll look at a leader in the oilfield services sector. The exploration and production companies put their money down finding the oil, siting the wells, and bringing the product to the surface. But, they lack the specific expertise to complete those wells; companies like Schlumberger provide all the particular engineering and technical know-how needed to complete wells and put them into operation. These skills include, among others, drilling, hydraulic engineering, and pollutant control. In 2022, Schlumberger was the world’s largest offshore drilling company, measured by revenue.Drilling and well completion, however, are only part of Schlumberger’s operations. The company sees the writing on the wall, and understands that today’s fossil fuel energy regime will not last forever, and it is diversifying its operations now, both to expand its revenue base and to prepare the next generation of energy technology. These forays into alternate business models include Schlumberger’s business in digital technology, scaled to fit customer needs at any size and capable of tracking and accessing data, developing insights from it, and using that data to elevate performance. The company is also moving into AI technology, to enable autonomous operations on the oil patch.Schlumberger’s operations brought the company solid year-over-year increases in its headline financial results in the third quarter of 2023, the latest reported. The company had a bottom line of 78 cents per share, in non-GAAP measures; this was a full 15 cents per share better than the prior-year result, and came in 1 cent above the forecast. The earnings were based on $8.31 billion in total revenue, a figure that was up 3% from the previous quarter and 11% year-over-year. The company’s revenue, however, came up short of the forecasts, missing by $10 million.Free cash flow in the third quarter was strong, listed as $1.04 billion. This made up the larger part of the company’s $1.76 billion FCF for the first nine months of 2023. Schlumberger generated far stronger cash flows in Q1,2, and 3 of 2023 than in the prior year, when the nine-month total came to just $563 million.While Schlumberger saw sound financial performance, we should note here that the stock price has simply been treading water in 2023. Shares were barely breaking even at the end of trading on December 29, the year’s last trading day, and the stock was down approximately 16% from the peak it hit in September 2023.Turning to the Goldman view, we find that analyst Neil Mehta is bullish here, basing his view at least in part on the company’s solid performance as an offshore driller and its moves into digital tech. Moreover, the stock’s underperformance represents an opportunity. Mehta writes, “We believe that at the current price the stock is fundamentally undervalued as international rig count still remains below pre-COVID levels, offshore activity outlook has remained resilient and SLB continues to expand its digital business. We believe that the stock should be positioned to outperform as macro activity indicators continue to grind higher, margin expansion from repricing contract portfolios continue to improve and over time as the company begins to commercialize its newer businesses in new energy.”For Mehta, this provides support for a Buy rating, and his price target, set at $65, suggests a one-year upside potential of 25%. (To watch Mehta’s track record, click here)This stock has a Strong Buy rating from the Street, based on a lopsided split among the 13 recent analyst reviews – 12 to Buy and 1 to Hold. The shares are trading for $52.04 and their $70.58 average target price points toward a one-year gain of 36%. (See Schlumberger stock forecast)Chevron Corporation (CVX)From oilfield services we can move over now and take a look at a major-name exploration and production company. Chevron is ranked, by market cap, as the world’s third-largest oil company, valued at ~$281 billion by that measure.The company’s business and activities revolve around oil and natural gas exploitation, transport of hydrocarbon products, operation of a maritime shipping line for both crude oil and natural gas products, and a large-scale petroleum refining segment.Chevron is a major producer and supplier of a wide range of petrochemicals, including fuels, lubricants, and various additives. While not the main thrust of Chevron’s business, it’s probably the most visible in our everyday life – Chevron markets many of these products, including gasoline and diesel fuel, through its nation-wide chain of branded gas stations.The biggest recent news for Chevron, however, has come from two updates in its oil business. In 2023, in October, the company entered a definitive agreement with Hess Corporation, an independent E&P firm specializing in offshore hydrocarbon extraction. The agreement’s total value comes to $60 billion, including the $53 billion all-stock acquisition transaction and approximately $7 billion in debt assumption by Chevron. The merger is expected to be completed in 1H24.The second large piece of news for Chevron comes from Kazakhstan, near the northeastern shores of the Caspian Sea. Chevron is expanding an already significant operation in this area, where it has a 50% interest in Tengizchevroil, or TCO. TCO is the operating firm exploiting the Tengiz oil field, a ‘supergiant’ field known to be one of the world’s largest single-trap producing reservoirs. The Tengiz has a massive proven reserve, estimated at 25.5 billion barrels of recoverable oil. Daily production in the field is already averaging 600,000 barrels of crude oil every day, along with 22 million cubic meters of natural gas.Chevron’s last reported financial results on record are from 3Q23, when the company had $54.08 billion at the top line. While this total was more than 18% below the prior-year revenue, it did beat the forecast, by $1.08 billion. The oil giant’s earnings, the non-GAAP EPS, came to $3.05 per diluted share – and missed the forecast by 64 cents per share. Investors were not too keen on the results, sending shares down in the aftermath. Overall, the stock trended lower in 2023, falling some 17% from the peak seen in January last year.Laying out the Goldman Sachs view of Chevron, analyst Mehta lists several factors to support optimism, including strong prospects for gains in the HES acquisition and the Tengiz oilfield expansion operations. He writes of CVX, “Heading into 2024, we believe (a) improving earnings execution, (b) regular updates on TCO, (c) continued commitment to return of capital through-the-cycle, and (d) attractive balance sheet should drive 2024 outperformance. On capital returns we expect the company to be competitive in return of capital, with GS estimates of ~$29 bn in 2024 (buybacks + dividends), representing ~10% yield, with room for upside on potential HES transaction close, based on company commentary. On Tengiz, we continue to look for updated management commentary surrounding the WPMP and FGP start-ups in 2024 and 2025, where we see the project driving a clear Upstream volume ramp and cash flow inflection in 2025.”Putting this into quantifiable form, Mehta rates CVX as a Buy, and his $180 price target implies the shares will appreciate by 21% through 2024.For the Street generally, this stock remains a Buy, albeit a Moderate Buy. This consensus rating comes from 18 analyst reviews, breaking down 12 to 6 in favor of Buys over Holds. Chevron’s shares have a current average target price of $179.59, suggesting a 20% one-year increase from the last trading price of $149.16.

Nvidia stock finished 2023 up 239% last year, crossing the trillion-dollar mark to become only one of five U.S. stocks to have a valuation above that line. The business also delivered phenomenal growth on the top and bottom lines.In its third quarter, revenue jumped 206% to $18.12 billion, and its net income according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) jumped more than thirteenfold to reach $9.24 billion, giving it a margin of more than 50%.Heading into 2024, Nvidia looks to be in great shape for even more growth. Its AI-focused H100 accelerators are in such high demand that prices for them have skyrocketed, and there's a shortage of its GPUs and other components used for its AI models.The spoils of the AI boom are likely to spill over to other companies in 2024, and while Nvidia may retain its lead in AI chips, other chip stocks could narrow the gap. Here are three that could outperform the AI chip leader in 2024.If any semiconductor company is going to pose a challenge to Nvidia in AI capabilities, it seems likely to be Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD).The company's launch of its Instinct MI300 AI accelerators in December was highly anticipated, and the stock jumped 10% on the launch presentation, a sign Wall Street liked what it saw.Among the customers for the new component are Dell, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, Microsoft, and Oracle, among others. AMD also said the Instinct Platform can offer a throughput increase of 60% for running inference on large language models compared with the Nvidia H100 HGX.AMD also made a number of acquisitions in the AI space recently. It acquired AI software leader Mipsology and Nod.ai, an open-source AI software expert, which will help it accelerate its deployment of AI solutions.AMD stock was no slouch in 2023. The stock jumped 128%. But expectations in 2024 are still modest, with the consensus calling for 16% revenue growth. If its new products take off, AMD could easily top that forecast and the stock could soar.ACM Research (NASDAQ: ACMR) is a relative unknown in the semiconductor sector. The company doesn't make chips, but instead makes machines that clean semiconductor wafers, an important process to ensure that these tiny components don't make errors.That position in the value chain makes ACM something of a picks-and-shovels play in the sector, but it also stands to benefit from the AI boom, since cleaning requirements are likely to become more technical as chips become more advanced and AI components become more in demand.ACM Research is a small company, with a market cap of $1.2 billion, but its recent results are impressive. Revenue rose 26% to $21.3 million, with a 31% increase in shipments even during a cyclically challenging period in the semiconductor industry. On the bottom line, adjusted net income rose 33% to $37.5 million.ACM is mostly focused on China, where it's considered a domestic supplier. That could give it an advantage at a time when a tech cold war between the U.S. and China is heating up, with the U.S. banning the export of some advanced technologies to China.The stock is cheap at a price-to-earnings ratio of 15, so it shouldn't take much to drive the stock higher in 2024, even after it gained 154% in 2023.Finally, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) also looks poised for a strong performance in 2024.Taiwan Semiconductor, also known as TSMC, is the world's largest contract semiconductor foundry, handling roughly half of semiconductor manufacturing for companies including Apple, Qualcomm, Broadcom, AMD, Nvidia, and Intel.AI makes up about 6% of the company's revenue, but given the company's strong position in chip manufacturing and even larger market share in the manufacturing of advanced chips, it should see steady growth ahead from increasing AI demand.Like other semiconductor companies, TSMC is fast at work increasing capacity to handle demand for AI production. That momentum may already be starting to build, given that revenue in October jumped 16% from the year before.Compared with the chip designers, TSMC stock is also affordably priced, at a price-to-earnings ratio of 20. With a broader recovery in the chip sector expected in 2024, TSMC could be a big winner.Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?Before you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn’t one of them.

When they do flash, strong stock market gains tend to follow, according to historical S&P 500 data going back to 1950.The trifecta has flashed 31 times since 1950, delivering a positive calendar year return 90% of the time with a median gain of 17.2%. If such a gain materialized in 2024, the S&P 500 would be trading at just under 5,600, which is higher than the most bullish forecasts on Wall Street.The last time the indicator flashed was last year, when the S&P 500 ultimately delivered an annual return of 24%. Before that, the indicator flashed in 2019, delivering an annual return of 29%.The three times the stock market moved lower despite the January trifecta occurring was in 2018, 2011, and 1966.These are the three indicators that need to flash this month for the trifecta to happen:The S&P 500 needs to post a positive return during the Santa Claus Rally, which is a trading window that includes the last five trading days of December and the first two trading days of January.Stocks are teetering on the edge of flashing this signal. The S&P 500 is down 0.10% since the trading window opened, and there's still one full trading day left.The S&P 500 needs to post a positive return during the first five trading days of January for the trifecta to happen.Stocks kicked off the first trading day of January with losses, with the S&P 500 falling more than one-half of a percent. Historically, stocks have tended to post strong gains when the first five trading days of January were positive.The S&P 500 needs to post a positive return during the month of January for the trifect to happen. That means investors won't know if the January trifecta has flashed until the end of the month, assuming the Santa Claus Rally and first five trading days of January are positive.Read the original article on Business Insider"}

{"date": "2024-01-03-16-39", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/could-only-buy-3-stocks-131500104.html", "text_blocks": "Investors have thousands of choices when it comes to stocks to pick. Even when limiting themselves to one subset of stocks, such as the consumer names, investors may still have difficulty boiling down their decision to three top stocks.Nonetheless, some stocks have succeeded at growing market share and driving returns through innovations. They also may create ecosystems that foster virtuous cycles which reinforce the success of their businesses.Three stocks that have excelled at this are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI), and Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), and as they continue to serve more customers, investors will likely continue reaping the benefits.The public knows Amazon best for its unprecedented success on the e-commerce front. Its reach in e-commerce has made it a household name among consumers.Amazon's financials make it unclear whether that business earns a profit. However, it fosters other revenue streams such as subscriptions and advertising that generated tens of billions in revenue at higher margins.Additionally, its Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment, originally meant to promote e-commerce, inadvertently gave birth to the cloud-computing business. Despite rising competition, it remains the leading cloud-computing company and accounts for most of Amazon's operating income.These successes led to $405 billion in net sales in the first nine months of 2023, rising 11% compared with the same period in 2022. Also, slower growth in operating expenses allowed Amazon to return to profitability. The $20 billion in net income is up from a $3 billion loss in the same year-ago period.Amid such improvements, Amazon stock rose by about 85% in 2023. And despite a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 79, its valuation is close to historical lows over the last few years. As both e-commerce and cloud computing continue to recover, it should bode well for Amazon's growth prospects in 2024.MercadoLibre operates exclusively in Latin America and, thus, may not be a household name to U.S. investors. Nonetheless, it gave birth to the e-commerce industry in Latin America in the late 1990s and, like Amazon, led to other business segments.Latin America is primarily a cash-based society. Hence, the company formed Mercado Pago to offer fintech solutions to allow cash-based customers to buy online. This enterprise later became a business of its own and evolved into the region's leading fintech company.Likewise, Latin America offers limited shipping options. The company addressed that by launching Mercado Envios to handle fulfillment and shipping. Mercado Envios and Mercado Pago work separately and together to reinforce each segment and grow MercadoLibre as a whole.That ecosystem drove over $10 billion in revenue in the first three quarters of 2023, a yearly increase of 36%. During this time, MercadoLibre kept general and administrative expense growth in check and reduced its provision for doubtful accounts. This led to $822 million in net income during the nine-month period, well over the $317 million during the same time frame in 2022.As investors took notice of such improvements, MercadoLibre rose by almost 90% in 2023. Despite turning profitable just last year, it supports a P/E ratio of 80, a valuation closely approximating that of better-known e-commerce conglomerate Amazon. As MercadoLibre's businesses foster further growth across Latin America, the stock price should continue to rise in 2024 and beyond.Shopify is in the highly competitive e-commerce-platform business. It stands out for its ease of use and extensive ecosystem. The platform allows entrepreneurs of all sizes, with no coding skills, to build e-commerce sites, and gives them the flexibility to tailor the site's appearance.Moreover, Shopify's ecosystem provides online sellers with numerous functions essential to succeeding as an online store. To this end, they can more easily process transactions with Shopify Payments or market with Shopify's social media and email-marketing capabilities.Furthermore, while it can serve entities of all sizes, Shopify Plus enhanced its value to large and high-growth enterprises. Shopify Plus allows for more rapid onboarding and has extra features such as wholesale-channel solutions or the ability to manage sales and inventory.Additionally, reversing its plans to build a logistics business relieved Shopify of a tremendous financial burden. Thus, its $4.9 billion in revenue in the first three quarters of 2023 surged 27% higher. And while Shopify lost $525 million during that time frame, it suffered a $1.3 billion impairment charge from the sale of the logistics business that led to the loss.Furthermore, Shopify earned $718 million in the third quarter, and with the company again turning a profit, its stock increased by almost 140% in 2023. Although the recent losses leave it without a trailing P/E ratio, its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is now at 15, a yearly high. That sales multiple is also low by historical standards, indicating the stock will probably keep moving higher in 2024.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

{"date": "2024-01-03-16-40", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/3-ultra-high-yield-dividend-102100295.html", "text_blocks": "With the curtain officially closed on 2023, it's safe to say that it was a phenomenal year for equities. The 127-year-old Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to a fresh record high, while the benchmark S&P 500 and growth-fueled Nasdaq Composite registered respective gains of 24% and 43%. It was a needed reminder of how powerful optimism and patience can be on Wall Street.Patience is also one heck of an ally when it comes to dividend stocks. According to a study from Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds, publicly traded companies that initiated and grew their payouts between 1973 and 2022 generated an annualized return of 10.24%. Not only was this better than the annualized return of the equal-weighted S&P 500 Index (7.68%) over the same timeline, but it also crushed the annualized return of non-payers (3.95%) over this roughly half-century span.These results shouldn't come as a surprise. Companies that pay a regular dividend to their shareholders are usually profitable on a recurring basis, and they can often provide transparent long-term growth outlooks. Most importantly, dividend payers tend to be time-tested.In an ideal world, income investors would enjoy high-octane yields with minimal risk. But in the real world, high-yields and risk tend to correlate. This means extra vetting is required by investors to seek out winners with ultra-high yields.The good news is that safe, supercharged dividend stocks do exist, and some are ripe for the picking by opportunistic income seekers. What follows are three ultra-high-yield dividend stocks, with an average yield of 8.83%, which are screaming buys in 2024.The first top-notch dividend stock that stands out as a no-brainer buy in 2024 is none other than telecom company AT&T (NYSE: T).Two factors contributed to AT&T's underperformance of the broader market last year. The first was rapidly rising interest rates. Legacy telecom companies are lugging around quite a bit of debt on their balance sheets. Future deals or refinancing could be considerably costlier as interest rates normalize at a higher level.The other headwind that held back AT&T stock was the July report by The Wall Street Journal that suggested the legacy use of lead-sheathed cables by telecom companies could result in hefty replacement costs and environmental/health liabilities.While there's no denying these are tangible concerns for AT&T, both appear to be largely overblown. Working backwards, the lead-clad cable concerns brought up by WSJ are a near-term nothingburger. AT&T hasn't found any evidence that its remaining lead-sheathed cables are a hazard to its workers or the environment. Further, any financial liability claims (should there be any) would likely take years to determine in the U.S. court system.As for AT&T's balance sheet, it's demonstrably improved over the past two years. At the end of March 2022, just prior to its spinoff of content arm WarnerMedia, which was subsequently merged with Discovery to create Warner Bros. Discovery, AT&T was sitting on $169 billon in net debt. But thanks to this spinoff, Warner Bros. Discovery assumed certain lots of debt previously held by AT&T. When combined with cash compensation, as well as AT&T's own organic debt-reduction efforts, it's lowered its net debt to $128.7 billion, as of Sept. 30, 2023.Most importantly, AT&T is operationally benefiting from the 5G revolution. Upgrading its network to support faster download speeds will lead to increased, high-margin data consumption by its wireless customers. Meanwhile, investments in mid-band spectrum have fueled five straight years of at least 1 million net broadband additions.A forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than 7 gives AT&T and its 6.6% yield a safe floor.A second ultra-high-yield dividend stock that stands head-and-shoulders above its peers as a screaming buy in 2024 is business development company (BDC) PennantPark Floating Rate Capital (NYSE: PFLT). PennantPark pays its dividend on a monthly basis, with the company increasing its payout twice last year.A BDC is a type of business that invests in the debt and/or equity of middle-market companies -- i.e., micro-cap and small-cap businesses. Although PennantPark held nearly $161 million in various common and preferred stock investments as of the end of September, its $906 million debt-securities portfolio makes it a predominantly debt-focused BDC.If you're wondering why the company chose to veer toward debt investments, the answer is yield. Most middle-market companies are unproven, and therefore have limited access to traditional debt and credit markets. When these smaller businesses do obtain financing, it's often at a lending rate that's above the market average. It's why PennantPark's weighted average yield on debt investments stood at a hearty 12.6%, as of Sept. 30.What's really fueled PennantPark's stellar operating performance of late is the fact that its entire debt-securities portfolio is variable rate. Every time the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, the variable rate on outstanding debt increases, too. Over the trailing-two-year period, ended Sept. 30, PennantPark's weighted average yield on debt investments climbed from 7.4% to the aforementioned 12.6%.As you can imagine, there are added risks putting money to work in smaller, unproven businesses. However, PennantPark Floating Rate Capital's management team has done an excellent job mitigating these risks. The company's average investment, including its equity holdings, is just $8.1 million spread across 131 companies. This means no single investment is imperative to its success.Furthermore, 99.99% of the company's debt-securities portfolio is first-lien secured debt. First-lien secured debtholders are first in line for repayment in the event that a borrower seeks bankruptcy protection.PennantPark may be small, but it's a true gem for income seekers.The third ultra-high-yield dividend stock that's a screaming buy in 2024 is tobacco behemoth Altria Group (NYSE: MO). Altria is the company behind Marlboro, the most-dominant premium cigarette brand in the United States.Altria's clearest headwind is that the percentage of adults smoking cigarettes has been steadily declining since the mid-1960s. Consumers have become aware of the potentially negative health consequences of long-term tobacco use. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that adult cigarette smoking rates have fallen to just 11.5%, as of 2021.Normally, a declining pool of consumers would be a red flag from an investment standpoint. However, tobacco kingpin Altria has proved to be an exception to the rule.The one factor Altria always has in its corner is pricing power. Tobacco products contain nicotine, which is an addictive chemical. The lure of nicotine for consumers has allowed Altria to increase its prices above and beyond the rate of inflation. In fact, price hikes have (often) more than offset the adverse impacts of lower cigarette shipments. This pricing power isn't going away -- especially with Marlboro accounting for a greater than 42% share of the cigarette market.This is a company that's also looking toward a smokeless future. On June 1, it completed a $2.75 billion acquisition of electronic-vapor company NJOY Holdings. Although Altria's sizable investment in e-vapor company Juul didn't pan out, Altria's purchase of NJOY looks to have rectified previous errors.More specifically, NJOY Holdings has received a half-dozen marketing granted orders (MGOs) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. MGOs are approvals for e-vapor products and devices that gives them a green light to be on retail shelves. Most e-vapor products lack MGOs, and could be pulled from retail shelves at any point in the future.Altria also has a sizable equity stake in Canadian licensed cannabis producer Cronos Group. If and when the U.S. federal government changes its tune on cannabis and reschedules or removes it entirely from the controlled substances list, Altria will be there to assist Cronos with product development and marketing.Lastly, Altria Group is inexpensive. While it's no longer the growth story it once was, shares can be purchased for around 8 times forward earnings. That's a stellar deal for a company yielding nearly 10% that's raised its payout 58 times over the past 54 years.Should you invest $1,000 in AT&T right now?Before you buy stock in AT&T, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and AT&T wasn't one of them.

As of 3:35 p.m. ET, the stock was down 5.19%.Part of what dragged the semiconductor company down was the stock market's broader decline to start the year. A Wall Street analyst also added fuel to the fire. Despite issuing a higher price target, the analyst doesn't view Intel as one of a select group of \"attractive\" chip stocks.Stifel analyst Tore Svanberg maintained a hold rating on Intel, though he increased his price target to $45 from $38. While that might seem like good news at first glance, it suggests an additional downside of 10% compared to Friday's closing price.The analyst laid out criteria for the semiconductor stocks he views as \"attractive\" heading into 2024. Svanberg believes this \"ideal mix\" includes stocks down from their recent highs, with strong balance sheets, and well situated to benefit from the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) revolution -- but Intel didn't make the cut.To add insult to injury, the analyst was clear about his top pick among AI stocks -- citing Nvidia as the top dog. Svanberg went so far as to call Nvidia his \"best idea\" for AI and accelerated computing. He went further, saying Nvidia \"presents a compelling opportunity ahead of the next phase of the company's AI cycle, software and services.\"Not everyone agrees with his decision to snub Intel. Late last week, Argus analyst Jim Kelleher maintained a buy rating on Intel shares and raised his price target to $60 from $42. For investors, this suggests a potential upside of 19% compared to Friday's closing price. Kelleher cited Intel's position in the data center and niche markets, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and applications acceleration, as reasons to buy.Despite soaring in 2023, Intel stock has been essentially flat over the past five years. The stock remains something of a mixed bag, and there are, in my opinion, far better ways to play the AI revolution.Should you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?Before you buy stock in Intel, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Intel wasn't one of them.

The Omaha, Nebraska, native has led his company to market-crushing success through multiple decades and informed and inspired millions of investors around the world.Strikingly, the famous moneyman has delivered incredible returns while largely avoiding the time-honored practice of portfolio diversification. Buffett does advocate diverse holdings for less-experienced investors, calling it \"protection against ignorance.\" But for investors who know what they are doing, he says it makes little sense. For this experienced investor, roughly 57.4% of Berkshire's $367.5 billion portfolio is concentrated in just two stocks.Read on as two Motley Fool contributors explain why Buffett has placed huge bets on a duo of industry-leading companies.Parkev Tatevosian: Surprisingly, the Oracle of Omaha has directed that 47.9% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio be invested in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock. I say surprisingly not because Apple is not worth investment, but because it's unusual to see even professional investors with such a concentrated portfolio. Nevertheless, I can understand why Warren Buffett likes Apple. It is one of the most innovative businesses worldwide, has a proven track record, and sells at a reasonable valuation.Apple's reputation as a trusted brand among consumers helps it retain those customers longer and encourages them to pay a premium for its products and services. That brand loyalty helped Apple grow revenue from $183 billion in 2014 to $383 billion in 2023. When it comes time to upgrade an Apple device, people often stick with the brand, especially because of the ecosystem Apple has built around it. For example, the Apple Watch integrates well with Apple's iPhone and is improved with services from Apple's App Store. If you have any of Apple's products, that ecosystem increases the inconvenience of switching to a rival brand.The ability to charge a premium has proven to be profitable for Apple. The company's operating income rose from $53 billion to $114 billion in the abovementioned years.And yet, throughout Berkshire's ownership of Apple stock where the stock price is up roughly 600%, the stock has never gotten too expensive to buy (when measured by the price-to-earnings ratio), giving Berkshire little reason to exit or dilute its investment in Apple stock. Perhaps those reading this article may consider following suit.Keith Noonan: Today, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) stands as Berkshire Hathaway's second-largest stock holding and accounts for roughly 9.5% of the company's portfolio. That represents an incredible vote of confidence from the Oracle of Omaha. But the stock actually started as a massive loser for Buffett.After first purchasing BofA shares in 2007, Berkshire completely exited its position in the stock in the fourth quarter of 2010. The bank's earnings saw weak recovery on the heels of the Great Recession, and it faced ongoing pressures due to the housing crash, subprime mortgage crisis, and other macroeconomic risks.Buffett contacted Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan directly in 2011 with a surprising proposal to provide the struggling financial giant with investment capital. Ultimately, Berkshire wound up buying $5 billion worth of the bank's preferred stock.Buffett's company also received warrants that would allow it to purchase 700 million shares of the bank's common stock at a price of $7.14 per share. It would up being an all-time great deal for Buffett.In June 2017, BofA stock had seen a dramatic recovery and was trading above $24 per share. Berkshire announced that it would be exercising its warrants -- a move that immediately scored a $12 billion paper profit for the investment conglomerate. The announcement spurred even more short-term gains for the stock, and shares continued to climb in subsequent years -- but the deal has been even sweeter than a quick look at Bank of America's stock performance would suggest.With the benefit of improving financial performance, BofA delivered impressive dividend growth since Buffett moved to exercise those stock warrants. The company currently pays an annual dividend of $0.96 per share -- working out to a 13.4% yield on those 700 million shares that Berkshire purchased at a share price of just $7.14.Berkshire also purchased more of the bank's stock since its big warrant move and now owns roughly 1.03 billion shares of BofA stock. With its massive investment position, Buffett's company is generating almost $1 billion in annual dividend income just for sitting on its Bank of America stock. With the bank likely to deliver another payout increase next summer, Berkshire's annual dividend income from the stock will almost certainly cross the $1 billion threshold.Despite a rocky start, Bank of America stock wound up being a massive winner for Buffett.

Some financial experts believe that the idealized view of retirement frequently contrasts with the experience. In particular, the significance of net worth undergoes a considerable shift.Don’t Miss:The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare?Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you.Hot take: How to turn a $100,000 investment into $1 Million — and retire a millionaire.In the years leading to retirement, net worth is a key indicator of financial preparedness. Accumulating wealth is crucial, as it dictates the lifestyle you can afford post-retirement. In 2023, NerdWallet data suggests that the average household aged 65-74 has a net worth of $1.8 million. This figure is the culmination of years of earning, saving and investing.Voyage Partners Financial Strategies CEO Niles Geary offers a provocative perspective on the topic. In an interview with GoBankingRates, he stated, \"Your net worth becomes meaningless when you retire. The only thing that matters is how much income your net worth produces.\" This viewpoint marks a critical transition from the phase of wealth accumulation to one of sustenance. In retirement, the sheer size of your financial reserves becomes less significant than the consistent income they generate.Retirees often face challenges that can erode their net worth. These include:Inflation: Unexpectedly high inflation can swiftly diminish the purchasing power of a retiree's savings, making it challenging to maintain a desired lifestyle.Health expenses: Unanticipated health costs can significantly impact financial reserves.Market volatility: Fluctuations in the market can affect the value of investments, a key component of many retirees' net worth.Lifestyle choices: Net worth determines options like travel frequency and quality of accommodations in retirement.The distinction between income and net worth becomes crucial in retirement. A substantial net worth, if not structured to provide a stable income, may be inadequate for a retiree's needs. Conversely, a lower net worth generating a reliable income can offer a more secure retirement.To ensure a stable income in retirement, consider these outside-the-box strategies:Investing in startups: Investing a small portion of your portfolio in startups can yield high returns. Crowdfunding platforms offer accessible ways to invest in early-stage companies.Real estate investment trusts (REITs): REITs allow you to invest in real estate without the hassle of owning physical property. They often pay high dividends, which can be a reliable income source in retirement.Peer-to-peer lending: Platforms that facilitate lending to individuals or small businesses can offer higher returns than traditional savings.Renting out a portion of your home: If you have extra space, renting it out can provide additional income without a significant investment.Developing a hobby into a business: Turn your passion into a source of income. Whether it's crafting, photography or gardening, monetizing a hobby can be both fulfilling and financially beneficial.Educational investments: Learning new skills or enhancing existing ones can open doors to consulting or part-time work in retirement.Health investments: Investing in your health through fitness and wellness activities can reduce future medical expenses, preserving more of your net worth for other uses.It’s also important to recognize the emotional and psychological impacts of retirement. Moving from a phase of saving to a phase of spending can be a significant transition. This change often brings a range of emotions — from excitement and freedom to anxiety and uncertainty. Understanding and preparing for these emotional changes is just as vital as financial preparation. It’s about finding a balance between financial security and emotional well-being.In this context, the role of financial advisers becomes invaluable. These professionals do more than just manage assets and create income plans; they offer guidance and support through the retirement planning journey. A good financial adviser understands that retirement is not just a financial event but a life event. They can provide personalized advice that aligns with both your financial goals and your aspirations for retirement.Financial advisers can help navigate the complexities of retirement income strategies, tax planning and estate planning, ensuring that your finances are in order. But perhaps more importantly, they can serve as a sounding board for your concerns and aspirations. They can help you visualize your retirement lifestyle and plan accordingly, ensuring that your financial strategy supports your desired lifestyle and personal goals.Read Next:Funders on this alternative asset platform are earning more than 14% annualized consignment profit funding Pro consignment opportunities.Discover why high-profile names like Leonard Dicaprio are turning to diamond assets and how you can get involved with just $100.What decision made this 20-year-old a millionaire in 1 year?\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?APPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis ReportTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis ReportThis article Does Your Net Worth Become 'Meaningless' When You Retire? originally appeared on Benzinga.com© 2024 Benzinga.com.

{"date": "2024-01-03-16-40", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/4-stocks-im-eyeing-cash-113700937.html", "text_blocks": "Cash is continually flowing into my portfolio. I have regularly scheduled deposits that add money each month. On top of that, I invest heavily in dividend stocks. Those recurring income payments increase my cash position since I don't automatically reinvest my dividends.Given the market's rally in recent months, I've been letting my cash position buildup. I'm waiting for the next sell-off to put some of my cash hoard to work. I currently have my eye on Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET), Blackstone (NYSE: BX), Digital Realty (NYSE: DLR), and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO). Here's why I hope to deploy some of my cash hoard to buy more shares of these high-quality companies in the coming year.Energy Transfer became one of my largest income-producing investments last year after it acquired Crestwood Equity Partners (which I also owned) in an all-equity deal. However, I'm hoping for an opportunity to add to my already sizable position.The big driver is Energy Transfer's lucrative and growing distribution. The master limited partnership (MLP) currently yields 9.1%. Meanwhile, the company expects to increase its payout by 3% to 5% annually. The midstream giant easily supports that big-time payout. It generates lots of stable cash flow and pays out a little more than 50% of that money to investors. It retains the rest to fund expansion projects and maintain a strong balance sheet. That balance sheet gives it the financial flexibility to make value-enhancing acquisitions like the Crestwood deal.Given my already large position, I want to wait for a decent pullback before adding to more units (Energy Transfer's unit price gained more than 17% in 2023). I might also use some of my cash to write some put options to generate income while trying to buy more units at a lower price.Digital Realty is one of two data center REITs I own. I added to my position when shares slumped in 2022. However, I initially held off on buying more shares last year due to concerns about its balance sheet and dividend. That caution proved costly as shares rallied more than 35% in 2023 as it secured several joint ventures to shore up its balance sheet so it could maintain its dividend (currently yielding 3.7%) while expanding its portfolio.The data center REIT is in a much better financial position these days. It has sold stakes in several operating data centers to raise cash to fund new developments and repay debt. It also secured partners, including Blackstone, to fund future data center developments. These moves put the company in a much stronger position to grow its data center platform while paying a compelling dividend.Given the growing need for data centers to support digitalization and AI, Digital Realty has lots of growth ahead. While I'd like to add to my position in the data center REIT, I plan to wait for a better price before boosting my stake.I added to my Blackstone position several times last year, taking advantage of the early weakness in its share price due to near-term growth headwinds. However, shares of the leading alternative asset manager have soared in recent months, sending the stock up more than 80% for the year. While I still think Blackstone is a decent value at the current level, I'd rather wait for a pullback before adding more shares.One of the things I like about Blackstone is its above-average growth. The company has grown its distributable earnings by around 20% annually for the past decade, about double the market's rate. That has enabled Blackstone to pay a bigger dividend since it distributes all its earnings to investors via dividends and share repurchases.Blackstone has several drivers that should power strong earnings growth in the coming years. Private credit is a big one. The company sees its private credit platform roughly tripling over the next decade to around $1 trillion in assets under management. The company also sees strong growth tailwinds for insurance solutions and private wealth as more high-net-worth individuals increase their allocations to alternative investments.I added Broadcom to my portfolio in late 2022. I took advantage of a decline in its stock price to lock in a pretty attractive dividend yield at the time from the semiconductor and software company. I wish I had bought more shares then, considering the stock doubled last year.Two catalysts drove Broadcom higher. It finally closed its deal to buy VMWare, which will power accelerated revenue and cash flow growth in 2024. The semiconductor company is also starting to capitalize on the AI craze, which is enhancing demand for its products.I'd love to buy more shares of Broadcom in 2024 if there's a meaningful pullback. It's a cash flow growth machine, which gives it the money to deliver healthy dividend growth. The company recently boosted its payment by 14%, its 13th straight year of dividend growth. Given its growth catalysts, I expect Broadcom to continue delivering strong dividend growth in the coming years.I've been building up my cash position in recent months, hoping for an opportunity to put that cash hoard to work when the market takes a breather. In the meantime, I'm assembling a list of stocks I'd love to buy, led by Energy Transfer, Digital Realty, Blackstone, and Broadcom. In the meantime, I plan to be patient, which will give me an even bigger cash hoard to deploy during the next downdraft.Should you invest $1,000 in Energy Transfer right now?Before you buy stock in Energy Transfer, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Energy Transfer wasn't one of them.

After founder Jack Ma made insulting comments about Chinese finance ministers, the tech giant bore the brunt of Beijing's crackdown on the tech sector, which led to a multibillion-dollar fine for Alibaba and a number of divestments to assuage Beijing's fears of tech monopolies taking over.Heading into 2024, some investors were hopeful that a turnaround could be afoot, but Alibaba shares were moving in the opposite direction today after Chinese economic data came in on the weak side and President Xi Jinping acknowledged the headwinds facing the company in a rare moment.Chinese stocks fell broadly today as a result, and Alibaba finished down 3.5%, matching the decline of the Nasdaq Golden Dragon Index, showing that Alibaba's peers were down by a similar percentage.China's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) showed factory activity declined slightly from November to December, falling to 49, its lowest level in six months. The report tamped down optimism that China's massive manufacturing sector would start to recover in 2024.Elsewhere, Xi Jinping commented on 2023 in a televised speech, \"Some enterprises had a tough time. Some people had difficulty finding jobs and meeting basic needs.\" The remarks seemed to underscore the difficulty China had in bouncing back from the pandemic.As one of China's biggest and best-known companies, Alibaba has been unable to escape the malaise around the Chinese economy.Alibaba's recent results have shown some signs of improvement. Revenue rose 9% in its September quarter to $30.8 billion, and operating income jumped 34% to $4.6 billion as its earlier restructuring plan seems to be paying off.Still, the company disappointed investors in November when it said it would no longer spin off its cloud unit due to the impact of U.S. chip exporting regulations.With investors still focused on the restructuring plan, Alibaba may be less exposed to China's weak economy than other Chinese stocks, but a recovery in the economy would still clearly benefit Alibaba as the stock hasn't returned to its pre-pandemic growth rate yet.Should you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?Before you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alibaba Group wasn't one of them.

The semiconductor specialist's share price ended the day down 6%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.AMD stock fell on news that ASML had halted shipments of its lithography machines for semiconductor fabrication to China. ASML's decision reportedly stemmed from pressure applied by the U.S. government.In addition to the big semiconductor-industry news, tech stocks also fell after Barclays analyst Tim Long downgraded the investment company's rating on Apple stock from \"neutral\" to \"underweight.\" Long lowered his one-year price target on Apple from $161 per share to $160 per share citing a less favorable outlook for the iPhone line and potential weakening for the company's services business.Today's big pullback for AMD stock highlights some of the key valuation threats facing the tech sector -- and growth-dependent chip stocks in particular. In terms of AMD's business-performance outlook, the ASML news looks much more significant than the ratings downgrade for Apple stock from Barclays.Tensions continue to rise between the U.S. and China, and the semiconductor industry has become a central battleground in the competition between the two world powers. While the U.S. has made moves to limit China's ability to purchase and manufacture high-performance artificial intelligence (AI) chips, China has indicated that it plans to bring Taiwan back under its territorial control.Given that AMD relies on chip-fabrication services from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the fraught geopolitical situation remains a key risk factor for the company.Following surging interest in AI technologies and momentum for the broader semiconductor space, AMD stock has also been pushed up to a much more growth-dependent valuation.While AMD's stock has posted explosive gains over the last year, the business's recent performance has been less impressive. Revenue rose 8% year over year in the third quarter, while non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share were up 21%. The semiconductor specialist's business performance hasn't been bad, but it's important to keep in mind that the 114% increase for its share price over the last year has been aided significantly by excitement about future opportunities in AI.Ultimately, I do think that AMD has what it takes to be a worthwhile long-term investment. The company looks poised to continue gaining market share from Intel in the central processing unit (CPU) and server markets, and it may also be able to gain some ground against Nvidia in the graphics processing unit (GPU) space that is central to the AI race.AMD has the potential to be a big winner, but investors should keep in mind that the stock's outlook is much more speculative after a year of explosive gains.Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?Before you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Advanced Micro Devices wasn't one of them.

When you only have a few years left until you retire, the financial decisions you make take on a new importance. Once you’re inside the five-year window, that’s a good time to review your plan to make sure you’re on track. It’s helpful to understand why the last five years before you retire are critical. Talking to a financial advisor can give you some clarity on what’s working in your plan or what isn’t.When you’re younger, time is on your side when it comes to investing for retirement. The more time you have to save and invest, the more opportunity your money has to grow. Waiting to start saving for retirement can mean having to play catch-up later. If you’re approaching the last five years before you retire, a late start can put you at a serious disadvantage. There are two reasons why.First, you have less time to benefit from compounding interest. Even if you’re maxing out annual contributions to a 401(k) or IRA, including catch-up contributions because you’re 50 or older, that may not be enough to make up for lost time in the market.The second reason is tied to the first. It’s natural that as you get older, you may begin to shift more of your assets toward safer investments. Moving into more conservative investments, such as bonds, can reduce the risk of losing money right before you retire. But you may also be trading off higher returns by doing so, something your portfolio may need if you got a late start on saving.The last five years before you retire are essentially a test of your preparation and planning up to that point. When there are five years left on the clock until your retirement, there’s one big question you need to answer: can I afford it?Whether the answer is yes or no depends largely on everything you’ve done to plan ahead. Some of the most important factors that can influence retirement preparedness include:What you’ve saved in workplace retirement plans or IRAsThe amount of debt you have, apart from your mortgageYour expected expenses in retirement, based on your preferred lifestyleHow long your savings will need to last, based on your age at retirementIf you’ve planned well and remained consistent with your plan, then you may not need to do much tweaking in the last five years before you retire. On the other hand, if your plan has some holes or you’ve yet to start planning at all, you may have more work to do to get ready for retirement.If you have five years until you retire, it’s helpful to know what you should be doing to gauge your readiness. Here are some of the most important things to tackle to ensure that you can retire comfortably and on time.Review your savings: In order to be where you want in retirement, you’ll need to know where you are right now. Specifically, that means understanding how much you have saved for retirement and how much you still need to save within the next five years to reach your goal.Running the numbers through a retirement savings calculator can help you see how close or how far away you are from your goal. You can use the resulting number to shape the next steps in your financial plan.If you’re behind, for example, then you may need to substantially increase 401(k) or IRA contributions. Or you may need to adjust your investment strategy in order to generate higher returns within the remaining years you have until you retire.Know your income sources: It’s a good idea to know what sources of income you’ll be able to count on once you actually retire. Depending on your situation, that might include:Withdrawals from a 401(k) or similar workplace planTraditional or Roth IRAsPension income if your employer offers a pension planSocial Security benefitsFederal Employees Retirement System (FERS) benefitsRental property income if you own real estateAnnuitiesYou may also have income from other sources, such as retirement accounts you inherit or a Health Savings Account (HSA). An HSA isn’t a retirement account, per se, as they’re intended to be used for eligible medical expenses. However, after 65 you can withdraw money from an HSA for any reason, penalty-free. You’ll just pay ordinary income tax on distributions.Taking inventory of your potential income sources can give you a better idea of how much you may have to spend. It can also help you to determine things like when to begin taking withdrawals from tax-advantaged plans, how much to withdraw and the best age to apply for Social Security benefits.Estimate retirement spending: Income is one side of your retirement budget and spending is the other. If you’ve got five years to go until retirement, that’s a good time to start thinking about what kind of lifestyle you want vs. what you’ll be able to afford based on what you’ve saved.Typical retirement expenses include housing, utilities, food and health care. But your budget may also extend to travel, recreation or new hobbies you’ve been wanting to try. Creating a mock budget, then comparing the numbers to your expected monthly income can help you see how far apart the numbers are.You may also take things a step further and try living on your retirement budget in the last five years before you retire. That can help you evaluate how realistic it is. If you expect to spend less in retirement than you are now, doing a test run of your budget could leave you with some additional money to save each month.Consider long-term care needs: Long-term care costs can easily wipe out your retirement savings. If you’re in the five-year span before retirement, that’s a good time to assess your personal risk.Medicare doesn’t pay for long-term nursing care, but Medicaid can. There’s a catch, however, as qualifying for Medicaid usually means spending down assets. If you don’t want to do that, you might consider buying a long-term care insurance policy in the five years before you retire.Long-term care policies can pay out benefits to cover necessary nursing care. If you’re not sure whether you’ll need long-term care, you could consider a hybrid policy that also includes life insurance. If you don’t use the long-term care benefit, then the policy can still pay out a death benefit to your beneficiaries.Review your tax situation: Managing tax liability in retirement can allow you to hold on to more of your savings. You may consider making some tax moves in the last five years before retirement that can position you to pay less to the IRS later.For example, you might convert your traditional IRA to a Roth IRA to get the benefit of tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Converting a traditional IRA to a Roth doesn’t allow you to escape taxes completely; conversions are subject to the same tax rules as withdrawals.However, once you’ve converted to a Roth account you won’t pay any tax on distributions going forward. That could yield significant tax savings if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket when you retire.The last five years before you retire can pass in the blink of an eye and there’s no time to waste when it comes to finalizing your plans. Taking time to review where you are and where you hope to be, can help to ensure that you don’t come up short once it’s time to leave the workplace behind for good.Creating a five-year plan for retirement can also include planning for any contingencies that might come along. Talking to a financial advisor can help you come up with a plan B if you’re worried about anything derailing your retirement timeline. Finding a financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If you’re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.Investing in tax-advantaged accounts, such as a 401(k) or IRA, is a smart move for retirement planning. If you want to add another savings option into the mix, you might consider opening a taxable brokerage account. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when you sell investments at a profit. However, they don’t have the same annual limits on contributions as tax-advantaged accounts and there are no early withdrawal penalties either.Photo credit: ©iStock.com/PeopleImages, ©iStock.com/AzmanL, ©iStock.com/OnfokusThe post How to Master the Last 5 Years Before Retirement appeared first on SmartReads CMS - SmartAsset."}

The debut of ChatGPT reignited interest in the sector and forced many to rethink what they thought was currently possible with the technology. As a result, countless companies pivoted their businesses to developing the industry.Data from Grand View Research shows the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030. That would see it hit annual sales exceeding $1 trillion before the decade's end. That makes now a great time to invest in this rapidly expanding industry and potentially profit from its promising outlook.Here are three AI stocks you might want to consider buying hand over fist in January.Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has an exciting year ahead, with plans to strengthen its role in AI by launching a new chip. The company will begin shipping its MI300X graphics processing unit (GPU) in 2024, designed specifically to challenge Nvidia's dominance.Nvidia soared to the top of the market in 2023, getting a headstart as it snapped up an estimated 90% market share in AI chips. Its success in the industry highlighted how far chipmakers like AMD are behind when it comes to AI.However, AMD spent the last 12 months refining its AI technology and it's hoping to make a big splash in the sector this year. As the cost of AI chips rises, the industry is desperate for increased competition and alternatives to Nvidia. Consequently, AMD's MI300X has support from firms across tech, with Microsoft's Azure announcing in December that it will become the first cloud platform to use the new GPU to optimize its AI offerings.The chart above shows AMD's earnings could hit $5 per share by fiscal 2025. When that figure is multiplied by the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 55, it gives a stock price of $275, suggesting growth of 87% over the next two fiscal years.AMD is on a promising growth trajectory and could be one of the smartest investments this month.Like AMD, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is hard at work designing a new AI chip to take on Nvidia in 2024. In December the company unveiled several new additions to its product lineup, including the Gaudi3, which is launching this year and is capable of powering demanding AI models.Intel has transformed itself over the last few years. A long history of dominance in central processing units (CPUs) saw it grow complacent, leaving it vulnerable to competition. Its CPU market share fell from 82% to 61% between 2017 and 2023 as AMD strengthened its position in the industry. Then in 2020, Apple ended its partnership with Intel in favor of in-house hardware, taking a significant bite out of the chipmaker's earnings.However, instead of throwing in the towel, the hurdles seemed to light a fire under Intel again. The company unveiled its first consumer GPUs in October 2022, venturing into a new market that would see it go head-to-head with Nvidia and AMD. The move was a smart one in the run-up to the boom in AI, as GPU technology is crucial to its success in the industry over the long term.Intel's massive growth potential is evident in its EPS estimates. This chart shows its earnings are projected to reach nearly $3 per share over the next two fiscal years. In a similar calculation to AMD, multiplying the figure by Intel's forward P/E of 53 yields a stock price of $140. If the estimates hold, the company's shares would deliver growth of 180% by fiscal 2025.As a result, Intel is absolutely an AI stock worth buying hand over fist this January.Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) enjoyed a glowing 2023. Its digital ad business made an impressive turnaround from the previous year, with revenue rising 11% year over year in its latest quarter (the third quarter of 2023) as it beat analysts' expectations by $980 million.Meanwhile, the tech giant has exciting prospects in AI. Alphabet's highly anticipated large language model Gemini debuted in early December, and is capable of crunching various forms of data with more sophisticated reasoning than any of the company's previous technology.Gemini and Alphabet's potent platforms, like Google Search and Android, could prove a powerful combination, presenting countless ways for the company to expand in AI. Alongside free cash flow that rose 29% over the last year to $77 billion, Alphabet has the financial resources and brand loyalty to go far in the industry.Alphabet's biggest competitors in AI are cloud giants Amazon and Microsoft. However, Gemini and Alphabet's massive user base suggests the company has equal, if not more, earnings potential in AI. Meanwhile, this chart shows Alphabet's P/E and price-to-free cash flow are significantly lower than those of its rivals, making its stock a bargain compared to Amazon and Microsoft.Alphabet likely has a bright future in AI and is a no-brainer investment this month.Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?Before you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Advanced Micro Devices wasn't one of them.

(NYSE: PFE) shares closed almost flat on Friday, but lost around 44% during 2023.Pfizer recently announced the completion of its acquisition of Seagen Inc (NASDAQ: SGEN) for $229 per share at a total value of approximately $43 billion.Pfizer recently provided its full-year 2024 guidance, which includes the expected financial impact from the Seagen transaction. For FY24, the pharma giant expects revenue of $58.5 billion-$61.5 billion, including the expected contribution from the Seagen acquisition versus the consensus of $63.17 billion.With the recent buzz around Pfizer, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company’s dividends. As of now, Pfizer offers an annual dividend yield of 5.84%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 42 cents per share ($1.68 a year).So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $102,809 or around 3,571 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $20,556 or around 714 shares.Read This: $1M Bet On This Healthcare Stock? Check Out These 3 Penny Stocks Insiders Are Aggressively BuyingTo calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($1.68 in this case). So, $6,000 / $1.68 = 3,571 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $1.68 = 714 shares ($100 per month).Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock's current price.For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.PFE Price Action: Shares of Pfizer closed flat at $28.79 on Friday.Read More: Passive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession, so it’s no surprise that people are turning to high-yield real estate notes that pay a fixed 7.5% to 9%.Photo: Shutterstock\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?PFIZER (PFE): Free Stock Analysis ReportThis article How To Earn $500 A Month From Pfizer Stock originally appeared on Benzinga.com© 2024 Benzinga.com.

However, they can also incur capital gains taxes that weaken your profits. Fortunately, you can implement tactics that reduce capital gains taxes so you can keep more of your money. Although the IRS taxes short-term and long-term gains differently, you can combat high tax rates on both. We’ll explain short-term and long-term capital gains and how to keep the associated taxes from costing you an arm and a leg.A financial advisor can help you tax-optimize your investment portfolio. Find a financial advisor today.What Are Capital Gains Taxes?You pay capital gains taxes when you profit from selling assets. You can incur two types of capital gains taxes: short-term and long-term. Short-term capital gains are from selling assets you’ve held for less than a year. On the other hand, long-term capital gains come from selling assets after holding them for a year or more. So, if you sell an investment property, the time you owned it before selling it will determine what kind of capital gains taxes you pay.How Are Capital Gains Taxed?The IRS taxes short-term capital gains as standard income, meaning your income tax bracket will determine your tax rate. Income tax brackets are as follows: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%. Your income determines your capital gains tax rates.For example, say you make $85,000 from your day job. You sell an investment property nine months after purchasing it and make a $30,000 profit. The sale results in a short-term capital gain, and your income is $115,000 when you file taxes. In addition, you’re a single filer, putting a portion of your income in the 24% tax bracket.Conversely, long-term capital gains have different tax rates than short-term gains: 0%, 15%, and 20%, depending on your income level and filing status. For 2023, single filers making up to $44,625 receive the 0% rate. Single filers with income between $44,626 and $492,300 will pay 15%. Finally, single filers with income above $492,300 will pay 20% long-term capital gains taxes. In addition, single filers making $125,000 or more annually will pay a net investment income tax of 3.8% on capital gains from real estate.A married couple filing 2023 taxes jointly will pay 0% if they earn up to $89,250. The 15% rate applies if the couple earns $89,251 to $553,850. The 20% rate applies if they earn more than $553,850.If you’re ready to be matched with local advisors that can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.How to Limit Capital Gains on Real Estate Investment PropertiesYou can use a variety of strategies to avoid capital gains on real estate properties:Use Tax-Deferred FundsYou don’t have to invest in real estate with dollars from your bank account. Instead, you can use your individual retirement account (IRA) or 401(k). Depositing investment profits in your investment account allows your money to grow tax-free. Plus, your IRA contributions can garner you another tax deduction.Make the Property Your Primary ResidenceThe internal revenue service (IRS) exempts primary residence sales from capital gains taxes up to $500,000 for married joint filers and $250,000 for single filers. You can also avoid paying taxes on depreciation deductions this way. Using this option means fulfilling the following requirements:Owning the home for two or more of the last five yearsLiving in the home as the primary residence for two or more of the last five yearsYou haven’t taken a primary residence exemption in two yearsTax-Loss HarvestingTax-loss harvesting means deliberately selling an asset for a loss to mitigate profits from another asset. Therefore, you can sell a property for less than you bought it, reducing your taxes.For instance, say you sell one property and make $30,000. You don’t want to pay taxes on this gain, so you sell another property for $25,000 less than what you paid. As a result, you pay taxes on $5,000 of capital gains.1031 ExchangeThe depreciation deduction for rental properties has one major drawback: when you sell a rental property, you owe taxes on the depreciation amount (if you received any). Fortunately, the 1031 exchange allows you to circumvent this rule.The 1031 exchange means using the income from the sale of an investment property to purchase another investment property of equal or greater value. Then, you don’t have to pay taxes on prior depreciation deductions. This caveat allows you to avoid income taxes on depreciation into perpetuity if you buy another property of equal or greater value.How to Minimize Your Capital Gains TaxEven if you can’t altogether avoid capital gains taxes, the following tactics will minimize your capital gains taxes:Depreciation DeductionThe IRS allows rental property owners to deduct an annual depreciation amount from their income. The deduction comes from the expected lifespan of rental property, which the IRS defines as 27.5 years. As a result, you can calculate your depreciation deduction by dividing your rental property value by 27.5 (commercial real estate uses the lifespan figure of 39 years).For instance, say you have a $250,000 residential investment property. Dividing this figure by the depreciation deduction lifespan of 27.5 gives you an annual deduction of $9,090.Itemized DeductionsGenerally, you can deduct the costs of managing property, lowering your tax burden. Running your real estate investment business incurs costs such as travel, legal fees, and business equipment. These expenses can add up – but instead of hurting your wallet, they can create a tax benefit.In addition, you can deduct mortgage interest and the costs of repairing or maintaining a property. Therefore, keeping detailed records and saving every receipt is vital to claiming as many deductions as possible.Methods to Boost Property BasisImproving your property gives two financial advantages: the costs of doing so can shrink your capital gains taxes, and the improvements can bolster your property value. Here’s how you can boost property basis:New windows and doorsUpdated appliances, roofing, and flooringRenovate plumbing, electrical, and HVAC systemsPaying commissions to real estate agentsExpenses for the appraisal, inspection, and legal servicesClosing costs, including title search, escrow, and taxesBottom LineCapital gains taxes can curb your profits from real estate investments. Fortunately, multiple deductions and tax strategies can lower your tax burden. For example, you can deduct depreciation and make a home your primary residence before you sell it. In addition, upgrading your home can boost your property basis and lower your capital gains taxes. So, it’s essential to be thorough in your research and record keeping to ensure you minimize capital gains taxes on real estate investments.Tips on Capital Gains Tax on Real Estate Investment PropertyYou can make the most of your real estate investments by familiarizing yourself with relevant tax laws.
