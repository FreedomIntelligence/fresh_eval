Is it 1 or not?,'\n',When it comes to infinity, things get a bit less intuitive and a whole lot more mind-bending. “Infinity” itself is not a number in the traditional sense; it’s a concept, an idea of boundlessness or endlessness.\n\nSo, I'll cut straight to it: dividing infinity by infinity isn't necessarily 1. It’s an indeterminate form. In the realm of mathematics, especially calculus, when you come across infinity over infinity, you're looking at something that needs to be approached with limits.\n\nI'm not going to dive into the deep end of calculus here, but basically, if you have a function heading towards infinity in the numerator and another one doing the same in the denominator, their behavior as they approach infinity can vastly differ. For example, the limits of both might increase, but one could be increasing much faster than the other. Picture yourself in the middle of a Portland downpour—it's relentless. Now imagine you're counting the raindrops hitting your window—tens, hundreds, infinity of them—versus the number of raindrops hitting all of Portland. Both seem endless, but the scales are entirely different.\n\nMathematicians use L'Hôpital's rule to handle these situations. You differentiate the numerator and denominator until you reach a point where you can resolve the limit and no longer have an indeterminate form.\n\nIn some contexts, sure, infinity divided by infinity can tend towards 1, but that's not a universal truth. It's all dependent on the functions and the context within which this division is taking place.\n\nTo anchor this in reality, consider the fact that you can have infinitely many numbers, and within this infinity, you can have infinitely many even numbers—which is a subset but also infinite. Division here isn't simple or clear cut.\n\nInfinity is like the Oregon coastline—it stretches out as far as the eye can see and beyond. You can keep driving along it, but you're never really going to reach an \"end.\" And just like those scenic vistas, when you try to compare one infinite section to another, it's hard to quantify it in straightforward terms.\n\nBottom line: Infinity divided by infinity can leave you scratching your head, just like trying to imagine the edge of the universe while you're gazing up at the stars on a clear night in Portland. It’s complex, fascinating, and requires careful mathematical consideration."}

Then \nn−k\n𝑛\n−\n𝑘\n is divisible by \nm\n𝑚\n as is \nn−k+m\n𝑛\n−\n𝑘\n+\n𝑚\n. But \nn−k+m\n𝑛\n−\n𝑘\n+\n𝑚\n is in the set of \nm\n𝑚\n consecutive integers being multiplied so the product must be divisible by \nm\n𝑚\n. \n■\n◼\n\nFrom the claim, it follows that \nn(n+1)\n𝑛\n(\n𝑛\n+\n1\n)\n is divisible by two, and both \n(n−1)n(n+1)\n(\n𝑛\n−\n1\n)\n𝑛\n(\n𝑛\n+\n1\n)\n and \nn(n+1)(n+2)\n𝑛\n(\n𝑛\n+\n1\n)\n(\n𝑛\n+\n2\n)\n are divisible by both three and by two so by six.\n\nFinally, we note that\n\nn(n+1)(2n+1)=n(n+1)((n−1)+(n+2))=(n−1)n(n+1)+n(n+1)(n+2)\n𝑛\n(\n𝑛\n+\n1\n)\n(\n2\n𝑛\n+\n1\n)\n=\n𝑛\n(\n𝑛\n+\n1\n)\n(\n(\n𝑛\n−\n1\n)\n+\n(\n𝑛\n+\n2\n)\n)\n=\n(\n𝑛\n−\n1\n)\n𝑛\n(\n𝑛\n+\n1\n)\n+\n𝑛\n(\n𝑛\n+\n1\n)\n(\n𝑛\n+\n2\n)\n\nAs both terms being added on the right hand side are divisible by six, so is their sum."}

Short answer:\n\nHumans invented mathematics as a conceptual language, syntax, and semantics.\nHowever, the discovered mathematical patterns and properties represent an objective reality of the nature that has existed for billions of years.\n\nLong Answer:\n\n1. Math as Human Invention\n\nI define mathematics a numeric language to describe quantity, quality, patterns, properties, structure, and transformation.\n\nThe word “language” is used in a somewhat metaphoric way. Math can be employed for problem-solving and modeling of a wide variety of phenomena.\n\nThis language is a human invention. We created the numbers and symbols that we use to represent mathematical concepts. We also developed the rules and theorems that govern how these concepts can be manipulated.\n\n2. Nature as Objective Reality\n\nOn the other hand, mathematics is also a scientific discovery. We didn't just make it up out of thin air. Mathematical patterns objectively exist in the universe, independently of human beings. Most mathematical concepts, such as numbers, shapes, and symmetries, exist independently of human perception. They can be found in the structure of atoms, crystals, planets, galaxies, and living organisms.\n\nFor example, the Fibonacci sequence can be found in the spirals of seashells and the arrangement of leaves on a stem.\n\nEinstein's theory of general relativity provided the mathematical framework for discovering black holes by Karl Schwarzschild, who found the first exact solution to Einstein's field equations of general relativity.\n\nThe Mathematical Universe Hypothesis goes even further, suggesting that the universe itself is mathematical in nature. This hypothesis states that the fundamental laws of physics can be expressed in mathematical terms, and that the universe is essentially a mathematical structure.\n\nSo, in a sense, humans invented math languages by discovering the mathematical patterns that exist in the universe.\n\nTime dilation geometry:\n\nMath as Language\n\nMathematics can be considered a language in some sense. A language is a system of communication that uses symbols, rules, and meanings to convey information. Mathematics meets these criteria, as it has a vocabulary of symbols, a grammar of rules, and a semantics of meanings. There are different varieties of math “languages”, each with its own unique syntax and semantics. Some specific examples of different math languages:\n\nGeometry\nEuclidean geometry: Classic geometry, and it is based on the axioms of Euclid.\nHyperbolic geometry: non-Euclidean geometry, based on the axioms of Nikolai Lobachevsky, to study 2D shapes with negative curvature.\nProjective geometry that is not based on the concepts of distance or angle.\nArithmetics and numeric systems\nBinary (Base-2): Used in computing, using only the digits 0 and 1.\nOctal (Base-8): digits 0 through 7.\nHexadecimal (Base-16): digits 0–9 and the letters A–F.\nTernary (Base-3): digits 0, 1, and 2.\nQuaternary (Base-4): uses the digits 0–3.\nRoman Numerals: (no zeros)\nBase-60 System: Historically used in ancient Mesopotamia, still present in our measurement of time (60 seconds per minute, 60 minutes per hour).\nAlgebra\nOctonions are a non-associative division algebra over the real numbers.\nSedenions are a generalization of the octonions, and they have been used to study a variety of phenomena in mathematics, including the theory of knots and Lie groups.\nClifford algebras are a family of non-associative algebras that are defined over vector spaces.\nJordan algebras are a type of non-associative algebra that has been used to study a variety of phenomena in mathematics, including the theory of operators and the classification of Lie groups.\n\nMath of Extraterrestrial Civilizations\n\nWe can imagine that aliens might use other types of math languages:\n\nMultidimensional geometry: Aliens might use mathematics to study the properties of spaces with more than three dimensions. This could lead to a whole new understanding of the universe and the laws of physics.\nAlternative number systems: Aliens might use number systems that are based on different numbers than 10. This could give them a new way of thinking about numbers and quantities.\nInfinite mathematics: Aliens might use mathematics to study infinite sets and transfinite numbers. This could lead to a new understanding of infinity and the nature of reality.\n\nMathematics is both a human invention and a discovery. It is a tool that we use to describe and understand the universe, and it may even be a fundamental part of the universe itself."}

I know the answer is 3, but I'm interested in how to solve this type of equation more generally.,'\n',There are limits to what sort of algebraic manipulations we’ll be able to do — for good reasons based on the theory of computability. We know that there is no algorithm to solve general Diophantine equations even with a small number of variables. Not generally as small as one, but the point remains that it is very easy to fall into either (a) the class of equations we’re looking at is powerful enough to represent computation, or (b) they’re not but a decision algorithm would be doubly-exponential or worse.\n\nFortunately, the example you give has a feature which makes it easy to solve. [math]6^x[/math] grows a lot faster than [math]5^x[/math], so if there is an integer solution then it’s going to be close to [math]\\log_6 405[/math]. That’s approximately 3.35 so the integer solution can only be 3. We do have to make one trial to verify that it works.\n\nIf the solution is not an integer, it’s unlikely it can be expressed in elementary terms at all. So then we’re stuck using numerical methods (which would be the case even if we had an exact answer in terms of the Lambert W-function or similar nonelementary expression.) One method to compute a solution is to derive a Taylor series expansion around an initial approximation. That gives us a polynomial expression we can then solve to get an approximate value in terms of logarithms and radicals… but of course, this only works up to degree 4, and then we’re back in weirdo-function land.\n\nFairly quickly, mathematicians stop asking the absolute question “can we solve X” and start asking relative things like “If I had the function that gives [math]x[/math] in the equation [math]A^x + B^x + C^x + D = 0[/math] given the coefficients, what else could I solve?” Unfortunately I can’t give a useful example relevant to your case.\n\nThere is a series solution to [math]z + rz^s=1[/math] when r is small.

This concept, which might seem a bit mind-boggling at first, is actually a fascinating aspect of set theory and the mathematics of infinity.\n\nTo visualize this, let's consider a simple example. Think about the set of all multiples of 2 (like 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on). This set is infinite because you can keep counting multiples of 2 forever. Now, consider the set of all multiples of 3 (3, 6, 9, 12, and so on). This is another infinite set. You can continue this process with multiples of 4, 5, 6, and any integer. Since there are infinitely many integers, you end up with an infinite number of these infinite sets.\n\nNow, let's delve a bit into the different 'degrees' of infinity. It sounds strange, but not all infinities are equal! Mathematicians distinguish between different types of infinity.\n\nCountable Infinity: This is the type of infinity we encounter with the sets of multiples of integers. You can list the elements one by one (even though the list never ends). The set of natural numbers (1, 2, 3, ...) is a classic example of countable infinity.\n\nUncountable Infinity: Some sets are so large that their elements cannot be listed out one by one. A famous example is the set of all real numbers (which include numbers like 1.5, π, square root of 2, and so on). This is a bigger type of infinity compared to countable infinity.\n\nThe concept of different sizes of infinity was pioneered by a mathematician named Georg Cantor in the late 19th century, and it was quite revolutionary. It showed that infinity is not just one thing; it has layers and complexities.\n\nIn conclusion, the world of mathematics allows for the existence of an infinite number of infinite sets, and it even allows for different types of infinity. This area of mathematics is both abstract and profoundly deep, revealing the surprising and counterintuitive nature of infinity."}

Let's break it down.\n\nFirst off, we've got to recognize what we're dealing with. The function y = log(x) refers to the logarithm of x, which essentially means we're trying to figure out how many times we multiply a certain number (the base of the logarithm, which is often 10 if unspecified) to get x. It's kind of like a mathematical detective game.\n\nNow, to graph this classic function, you'll need graph paper—or go digital with a graphing app if you’re in the 21st century. But before we even begin plotting points, there are a couple of things we need to keep in mind that are distinctive about logarithmic graphs:\n\nThe domain of the function is all positive real numbers. That means your x-values can never be zero or negative because you can't take the log of a non-positive number. So, if you attempt to plug zero or a negative number into this function, your calculator will flash an error message like a disco light.\nAs x approaches zero from the positive side, the y-value will drop off like a rock. It heads towards negative infinity, but won't ever actually touch the x-axis—much like how I avoid telemarketers.\nWhen x is 1, the y-value is always zero because any number to the power of zero is 1. It's like the north star of the logarithm world—always reliable.\n\nTime for action. Grab a ruler, and let’s sketch the y-axis (vertical) and the x-axis (horizontal) with a nice scale. If you're doing this by hand, be prepared for a bit of an arts and crafts project.\n\nNow, remember that logarithmic sweet spot I mentioned? Plot the point (1,0). This is where our graph will pass through the x-axis. From there, as x increases (let's say to 10 if you're using base 10 logarithms), the y-value will increase as well, but at a decreasing rate—like my motivation to run during a downpour here in Portland.\n\nNext, map out a few more points to get the general shape. For x-values greater than 1, the y-values are positive and increase. For x-values between 0 and 1, the y-values are negative.\n\nWhat you’ll end up with is a curve that starts deep in the negative y-values (down in the trenches), swoops up through (1,0), and then gently glides upwards, hugging the y-axis as it goes towards infinity.\n\nThe line will never cross into the land of negative x-values or above the x-axis to the south—that's like going beyond the Wall where the White Walkers live (and we know we don't want to go there).\n\nSo now you've got the graph of y = log(x), a smooth, elegant curve that's always heading up but never quite hitting the fast lane. It serves as a great reminder that growth can be steady without being like a rocket. And it's another excuse to avoid doing something less fun—like laundry.\n\nAnd if any of this got you cross-eyed, don't sweat it. Graphing calculators and software are here to rescue you faster than you can say \"I need caffeine.\" They'll plot these points with the grace of a ballet dancer while you sit back and admire the mathematical beauty."}

That doesn’t mean that there is anything exceptional about it. It is simply a reflection of the fact that there are so many possible combinations of words that, even if someone else were to express the same idea, the probability that they would use the exact same words is vanishingly small.\n\nI am certain that many other people have written easy-to-understand explanations of the Chinese remainder theorem, just as I am certain that many other people have written about the fact that most sufficiently long sequences of words written by a human are unique without being truly exceptional."}

As \nm\n𝑚\n is the positive square root of \n441\n441\n and is two larger than \nn\n𝑛\n, you discover that \nn=19\n𝑛\n=\n19\n.\n\nThe substitution of \nm\n𝑚\n allows you to immediately see that the left hand side of the equation has a term of \nm−1\n𝑚\n−\n1\n added to a term of \nm\n𝑚\n copies of \nm−1\n𝑚\n−\n1\n added together.

I'm pretty sure Von Neumann said so, and he was very smart.,'\n',No. But yes, but actually no.\n\nSo first things first: the way you phrased the question, you're implying that we have to believe whatever Von Neumann said because he was “very smart”. That's not how mathematics works, nor any other academic discipline.\n\nHere's the “but yes” part: Von Neumann was instrumental in developing a theory now known as Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory\n, or NBG for short. In the “full” version of this theory, which includes the Axiom of global choice - Wikipedia\n, it is indeed provable as a theorem that every proper class is in bijective correspondence with \nV\n𝑉\n, the class of all sets.\n\nMoreover, NBG is a conservative extension of ZFC, meaning that it's equiconsistent with ZFC, and sentences that only quantify over sets are provable in NBG if and only if they're already provable in ZFC. However NBG is more expressive than ZFC because you can state and prove theorems such as the one above, that deal with classes that aren't sets. ZFC doesn't even have proper classes so the proposition “all proper classes have the same size” can't even be stated, much less proved.\n\nSo how would we prove it in NBG? Well, a complete rigorous proof would actually have to go through the formulation of NBG in detail, which is beyond the scope of this answer, so I'll just give an outline.\n\nProof outline:\n\nIf you've studied set theory you may know that the Axiom of Choice implies the well-ordering theorem: every set has a well-ordering. In NBG, for essentially the same reasons, the Axiom of global choice implies that the class of all sets, \nV\n𝑉\n, has a well-ordering. So that's the starting point: there exists a well-ordering \n(V,<)\n(\n𝑉\n,\n<\n)\n in which every initial segment \n{x|x<y}\n{\n𝑥\n|\n𝑥\n<\n𝑦\n}\n is a set.\n\nNow let \nA\n𝐴\n be any proper class. Since \nA⊆V\n𝐴\n⊆\n𝑉\n the restriction of \n<\n<\n to \nA\n𝐴\n is also a well-ordering (and the initial segments are still sets, because they're subsets of the corresponding segments in \nV\n𝑉\n). Now, there is a theorem that says: if \n(A,<)\n(\n𝐴\n,\n<\n)\n is a well-ordered proper class whose initial segments are sets, then \nA\n𝐴\n is order-isomorphic to \n(Ord,∈)\n(\n𝑂\n𝑟\n𝑑\n,\n∈\n)\n, the class of all ordinals. Thus, \nA\n𝐴\n and \nV\n𝑉\n both are order-isomorphic to \nOrd\n𝑂\n𝑟\n𝑑\n, hence isomorphic to each other.\n\nThe theorem that's doing all the work here follows from the corresponding one in set theory which states that every well-ordered set is order-isomorphic to a unique ordinal. So, if you have a well-ordered proper class \nA\n𝐴\n as above, then for each \na∈A\n𝑎\n∈\n𝐴\n the segment \n{x<a}\n{\n𝑥\n<\n𝑎\n}\n maps to a unique ordinal, and this is easily seen to be an order-preserving map of \nA\n𝐴\n onto \nOrd\n𝑂\n𝑟\n𝑑\n. \n■\n◼\n\nOK, cool, so proper classes DO have the same size? Not so fast. The problem is that this relies fundamentally on the Axiom of global choice (GC), which turns out to be independent from the other axioms of NBG.\n\nTo be more precise: let NBC stand for NBG set theory but with GC replaced by AC, the usual Axiom of Choice for sets. (This is abusing the acronym because the G is for Gödel, not Global Choice, but never mind that.) In 1964 William Easton used forcing to show that there is a model of NBC in which GC is false, and indeed \nV\n𝑉\n cannot be linearly ordered in this model. Therefore, \nOrd\n𝑂\n𝑟\n𝑑\n is an example of a proper class that cannot be mapped onto \nV\n𝑉\n. [If it could, then for each \nx∈V\n𝑥\n∈\n𝑉\n there is a least ordinal that maps to \nx\n𝑥\n, which defines a bijection of \nV\n𝑉\n onto \nOrd\n𝑂\n𝑟\n𝑑\n which then induces a well-ordering of \nV\n𝑉\n.]\n\nSo, in Easton's model the class of all ordinals is smaller than the class of all sets, even though both are proper classes. But in NBG, they're the same size. So who's right, Von Neumann or Easton??\n\nThat's s rhetorical question, of course. Both of them are right. The proposition that all proper classes have the same size is equivalent (in NBC) to Global Choice, which is independent of NBC. It's a statement that can be neither proven nor disproven (in NBC), so debating whether it's “true” or not seems pointless in my opinion.\n\nVon Neumann was well aware of this, I’m sure. If you understand how axiomatic set theory works at this level, you understand that Von Neumann never actually “said” all proper classes have the same size, as a matter of Platonic Truth or whatever.\n\nThe most we can say is that he seemed to “prefer” working with set theories where the Axiom of limitation of size\n is a thing. (This axiom says that a class is not a set if and only if it maps onto \nV\n𝑉\n ; this axiom is also equivalent to Global Choice assuming NBC.) But, preference among set theories and axioms is pretty much subjective, as long as your preferred axioms don't actually contradict each other. Do you think AC is true in ZF? Do you think CH is true in ZFC? Do you think GC is true in NBC? It's the same story."}

The definition of manifolds was due to Riemann around 160 years ago. He constructed Riemann surfaces and then spaces that parametrized certain types of Riemann surfaces. Here are names that relate to how these were used.\n\nSpaces parametrizing other spaces are called Moduli Spaces. Most mathematicians don’t know much about these, and those who do use them in very careful ways to draw conclusions about the nature of the spaces they parametrize. Also, Einstein learned how to formulate his (general relativity) laws using Riemann’s Riemannian manifolds (not complex analytic) whereby the concept of curvature appears. This is still a frontier. Not easily used or generalized to new situations. That is, it is done very carefully, and the results of these constructions are studied very slowly.\n\nWhat it means to imagine these spaces is another matter. Humans still can’t SEE easily spaces they can describe (by equations sometimes) that can’t fit in 3-dimensional space. Sometimes they can picture a property that is akin to what happens in 3-space, but … Some topologists like to claim they can SEE the spaces they have constructed. That’s nice.

This curve could be representing speed, profitability, population growth, or a thousand other things. But life isn't always so neat. The curves don't always follow a simple path, and we can't always integrate them easily, which is where numerical methods like the trapezoidal rule come into play.\n\nThe trapezoidal rule is a technique for approximating the definite integral of a function. Remember that an integral is essentially the area under a curve. So what the trapezoidal rule does, in essence, is it breaks down the curve into smaller, more manageable pieces – trapezoids (hence the name). Then, it sums up the area of these trapezoids to give us an approximation of the total area.\n\nNow, the equation. To put the trapezoidal rule into action, suppose you have a function f(x) that you want to integrate from a to b. What you'll do is split this interval [a, b] into n smaller intervals of equal width, which we'll call h. This h is simply (b-a)/n.\n\nPicture these smaller intervals turning into the top bases of trapezoids. The rule goes like this:\n\nThe area under f(x) from a to b is approximately:\n\n\\[ A \\approx \\frac{h}{2} [ f(a) + 2\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} f(a + kh) + f(b) ] \\]\n\nBreaking that down, h/2 is just scaling our trapezoids' height. f(a) is the first y-value at the left endpoint, f(b) is the last y-value at the right endpoint, and the summation part in the middle is simply adding up the y-values at all the internal points, with each getting counted twice since they are the endpoints of the intermediate intervals. Multiply every term by our height factor, h/2, and boom – you've got the approximate area.\n\nA perfect real-world instance for me in Portland, OR, would be estimating the area of a peculiarly shaped plot of land that maybe I'm looking at for some cultivation. I can graph the shape's outline as a function, apply the trapezoidal rule, and get a reasonable estimate of its size without hiring a land surveyor to do the job.\n\nNow, it's key to take note that the trapezoidal rule is just an approximation. The more slices n you break the interval into, the better your estimate gets, but there's always a slight margin of error unless the curve happens to trace the exact tops of the trapezoids.\n\nThis rule is a sweet reminder that sometimes a practical, close-enough answer today is better than a perfect answer that's impossible to get without tremendous effort. It's about working smarter, not harder — or, in this case, integrating smarter, not harder."}

If this is consistent, you're likely dealing with an exponential function. The numbers should be getting bigger pretty rapidly if it's exponential growth we are facing.\n\nOkay, getting down to brass tacks, find two points from your table. We will label them (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Now apply these to the form f(x) = Ab^x.\n\nFor each point, you'd then have the system of equations:\n\ny1 = Ab^(x1)\ny2 = Ab^(x2)\n\nTo solve for b, the growth factor, you can divide one equation by the other:\n\ny2 / y1 = (Ab^(x2)) / (Ab^(x1))\n\nSimplifying that, you get:\n\n(y2 / y1) = b^(x2 - x1)\n\nNow you can solve for b by taking the (x2 - x1) root of (y2/y1), or apply the logarithm if you prefer dealing with these things algebraically.\n\nAfter finding b, plug it back into one of the original equations to solve for A. Choose the equation with the x-value that gives you the simplest arithmetic, which is usually the smallest x-value, but not always.\n\nAnd there you have it, you'll find A and b which define your exponential function.\n\nNow, I've laid it out all nice and mathematical, but I'd be amiss if I didn't say this: get familiar with plotting the points on a graph if you can. Visualization can be a tremendous help and sometimes you see patterns you didn't catch in the raw numbers. Plus, when you're in Portland, OR like I am, sometimes it's just a good excuse to sit by the window on a rainy day, graphing it out and watching the world pass by.\n\nRemember, every function tells a story, and your function's setting and characters are right there in the table. Don't rush through it—let the table talk to you."}

Can we prove their existence even though they are abstract concepts used to define other mathematical concepts?", "text_blocks": "How are numbers defined in mathematics? Can we prove their existence even though they are abstract concepts used to define other mathematical concepts?,'\n',As a computer scientist, I like computational definitions, because to my mind they avoid this whole question of “existence”. In general, Plato and his followers tended to think that (natural) numbers were real, and maybe even more real than any physical objects, while other philosophers disagreed. Let me lay out to you one way to define numbers whose reality, to my mind, is very hard to argue against, because it is constructive.\n\nThis construction is known as Church numerals\n, and it’s based on the formalism called Lambda calculus. All entities in lambda calculus are, basically, computer programs.\n\nHere are some definitions and explanations:\n\n0 is defined as \nλf.λx.x\n𝜆\n𝑓\n.\n𝜆\n𝑥\n.\n𝑥\n\nThis is a program that takes two inputs: a function \nf\n𝑓\n and an item \nx\n𝑥\n, and then returns back \nx\n𝑥\n.\n\n1 is defined as \nλf.λx.(fx)\n𝜆\n𝑓\n.\n𝜆\n𝑥\n.\n(\n𝑓\n𝑥\n)\n\nThis is a program that takes two inputs: a function \nf\n𝑓\n and an item \nx\n𝑥\n, and then returns back \nf(x)\n𝑓\n(\n𝑥\n)\n, or \nf\n𝑓\n applied to \nx\n𝑥\n once.\n\n2 is defined as \nλf.λx.(f(fx))\n𝜆\n𝑓\n.\n𝜆\n𝑥\n.\n(\n𝑓\n(\n𝑓\n𝑥\n)\n)\n\nThis is a program that takes two inputs: a function \nf\n𝑓\n and an item \nx\n𝑥\n, and then returns back \nf(f(x))\n𝑓\n(\n𝑓\n(\n𝑥\n)\n)\n, or \nf\n𝑓\n applied to \nx\n𝑥\n twice.\n\n3 is defined as \nλf.λx.(f(f(fx)))\n𝜆\n𝑓\n.\n𝜆\n𝑥\n.\n(\n𝑓\n(\n𝑓\n(\n𝑓\n𝑥\n)\n)\n)\n\nThis is a program that takes two inputs: a function \nf\n𝑓\n and an item \nx\n𝑥\n, and then returns back \nf(f(f(x))))\n𝑓\n(\n𝑓\n(\n𝑓\n(\n𝑥\n)\n)\n)\n)\n, or \nf\n𝑓\n applied to \nx\n𝑥\n three times.\n\nSo a number in this world is just a program that does something. This type of approach may sound a little weird or silly, but starting with these definitions you can do arithmetic, including fractions, negative numbers, etc, and basically all of mathematics that falls into the “computable” category, which is quite a lot. In other words, this approach allows one to do anything a computer can do. For example, adding \nm\n𝑚\n to \nn\n𝑛\n is just applying an “increment” function to \nn\n𝑛\n, \nm\n𝑚\n times, which is indeed what a number \nm\n𝑚\n can do, according to the way we defined it, and we can construct everything in this programmatic and mechanical way.\n\nSo, if you ask me to prove their existence, I think it’s quite straightforward. First of all, I literally just told you what they are. I defined them to be programs, and surely programs exist. If ChatGPT is real, so is the number 1. Programs aren’t quite physical objects, but they are sets of actions that people or machines can take, so they are as real as any action, like “running” or “eating” or “solving a crossword puzzle”. I am sure some philosopher somewhere will disagree, but we certainly act as if these things are real. We can even buy and sell programs.\n\nAnd of course anything built on such foundations, i.e. other programs, are equally real, because they can be written down and executed, and most useful mathematical concepts can be written down as programs, so they also exist.\n\nAs a word of caution, this is not the approach that the mathematicians usually take, because they want to also deal with concepts that are not computable, or involve actual infinities which can’t be quite modeled in this framework. However, it’s provable that when they talk about concepts that are computable, they are talking about things that are equivalent to what I defined above. There are some weird mathematical artifacts like Banach-Tarski paradox\n which philosophers can argue aren’t real, and because it involves applications of axiom of choice to infinite sets, you certainly can’t construct it. But I would argue that natural numbers, which can be constructed, certainly are real and exist."}

My teacher firmly believes that they aren't really part of math, and aren't actual numbers. Could I show otherwise with just concepts from Algebra 1 and below?,'\n',Other answers involve the myriad uses of complex numbers, both from theoretical and practical perspectives. But I’d take a different tack. A Socratic tack…\n\nSee, the Socratic Method is a teaching philosophy in which the would-be teacher doesn’t lecture. Instead, they ask pointed questions of the students. When done correctly, the questions are designed to draw out the point of the lesson, and the student will learn through the process of attempting to answer the questions.\n\nYou have someone (whether it’s a teacher or not) claim that imaginary numbers aren’t “numbers”? Fine. I’d start by asking: “What is a number?”\n\nI can’t tell you how they’ll answer, but they’ll probably inadvertently go in one of two directions: either their answer is expansive, and includes imaginary numbers (and other things), or their answer is unintentionally restrictive, and likely rules out other things (like real or rational numbers) that they would already accept as numbers.\n\nFor what it’s worth (part 1), there is no generally-accepted mathematical definition of a number as far as I know. There are definitions of all kinds of things whose names include the word “number,” like rational numbers, real numbers, complex numbers, cardinal or ordinal numbers, etc. And there’s a whole area of study called “number theory.” But in the context of this question, you’d expect the first question of number theory is: “what is a number,” but sadly that question doesn’t come up at all.\n\nFor what it’s worth (part 2), I personally think a nice definition of a number is: something you can do arithmetic with. What’s arithmetic? A suitably-interesting binary operation, I guess. “Suitably-interesting” may mean it has all the trappings of the classic operations like addition and multiplication. Maybe you want it to have an identity element, maybe you want at least some of your “numbers” to be invertible, etc.\n\nI’ve had this discussion before, strangely enough. I sometimes like to try to guide my Socratic student towards that definition, but they don’t always go willingly."}

Do mathematicians really value rigor above everything else?", "text_blocks": "The Banach-Tarski paradox is clearly wrong. I don't understand mathematicians who are insensitive to this. Do mathematicians really value rigor above everything else?,'\n',I will take exception to the hypothesis of this question. The rest is a matter of philosophy which these days I find suspect. The paradox is certainly not “clearly wrong”? What is wrong about it? The fact that you have some mental notion of how nonmeasurable sets are supposed to act? Guess what? They don’t act that way. Measurable sets act the way you think “measure” should, that is why they are defined the way they are. But the point is that a vast number of sets are not measurable. These sets can be rotated and translated and you can take the disjoint union of sets that are not measurable and end up with a measurable set. The paradox is that you can take the union of these sets in two ways and get two vastly different measurable sets. But although this is bewildering, it’s not strictly a paradox in that it doesn’t violate anything you might believe about measurable sets.\n\nWe see this thing all the time in mathematics when we extend the axioms to cover sets that are not finite or not even countable. The extensions are useful because they help us prove theorems which might not be otherwise provable or maybe just hard to prove. But that doesn’t mean they apply to all notions of how the world works. We extend the integers to the rationals and the rationals to the reals and the reals to the complex numbers. But at that point, we get some very strange things that are true about complex numbers. Maybe you only believe in some subset of the complex, not all of them. But that is messy. Certainly mathematicians have explored these more restricted number sets. Much nicer is to have a set that is algebraically closed otherwise you end up with all sorts of exceptions baked into theorems."}

When you dive into the wild and wonderful world of trigonometry, you'll unearth a gem known as the Pythagorean identity. This identity connects the sine and cosine of an angle in a rather elegant formula. Let's break it down.\n\nSo if you're looking at 1 - cos^2(x), what you're actually peeking at is the setup to use one of the fundamental identities in trigonometry. The identity goes like this:\n\nsin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1\n\nI can hear the gears turning. See, by rearranging this identity ever so slightly, we can solve for sin^2(x) by itself:\n\nsin^2(x) = 1 - cos^2(x)\n\nEureka! This is exactly the formula you're asking about. When you see 1 - cos^2(x), you can substitute it directly with sin^2(x), no bells and whistles attached. It's a straight swap, a one-for-one.\n\nIn these vast swaths of abstract math realms, it's connections like these that serve as your trusty sword and shield. They allow you to simplify, to solve, and ultimately to understand the relationships between various trigonometric functions. And once you've got a hold of these identities, you're pretty much the math wizard of your own numerical domain.\n\nRemember, there's a sort of beauty in the simplicity and symmetry of mathematics, especially when it comes to trigonometry. Embrace these identities, and you'll find yourself doing a whole lot less memorizing and a whole lot more understanding. That's what the world of math is all about: taking elegant solutions and spinning them into the fabric of more complex problems.\n\nAnd lets be real, whether it's a serene Portland sunrise creeping over the horizon or the systematic elegance of a trig identity, there's nothing quite like appreciating the neatness of the universe's little symmetries. Keep this identity in your back pocket, and you'll be seeing mathematical equations in the undulating waves of the Willamette River. Nature has patterns, my friends, and so does math."}

Math has a built-in feature called “come up with new language”. It’s done all the time. Really. Easiest thing in the world, math-wise.\n\nThe equation \ncos(x)=x\ncos\n⁡\n(\n𝑥\n)\n=\n𝑥\n already has exact an exact solution. It doesn’t have “only numerical approximations”, it has an exact solution, which is a real number.\n\nOnce upon a time we didn’t have real numbers. We only had rational numbers. Back then you would be justified in saying, damn, why can’t we pinpoint the solution of \ncos(x)=x\ncos\n⁡\n(\n𝑥\n)\n=\n𝑥\n? (Let’s pretend you already had cosine, back then).\n\nWe can compare \ncos(3/4)\ncos\n⁡\n(\n3\n/\n4\n)\n and \n3/4\n3\n/\n4\n, and it’s close but not the same. We can try \nx=14/19\n𝑥\n=\n14\n/\n19\n and it’s even closer. And \nx=17/23\n𝑥\n=\n17\n/\n23\n is really close. We keep going. Always getting closer. Never quite making the equality work.\n\nSo, we invent a new language called real numbers, and now we have a unique, nice, precise solution to the equation. And not just that equation. We have \n23\n−\n−\n√\n23\n which is the precise positive solution of \nx\n2\n=23\n𝑥\n2\n=\n23\n. And we have \ne\n𝑒\n which is the precise solution of \nln(x)=1\nln\n⁡\n(\n𝑥\n)\n=\n1\n (yes, we can define the function \nln\nln\n without any reference to the particular number \ne\n𝑒\n.) And so on.\n\nThis is very similar to the way real numbers were actually first observed, when early Greek thinkers wanted everything to be rational and noticed that some things, like the diagonal of a square, refuse. The formal definition of reals came much later, but the motivation was the same.\n\nI can see you're still dissatisfied. You want \ncos(x)=x\ncos\n⁡\n(\n𝑥\n)\n=\n𝑥\n to have an explicit, comprehensible, “closed-form” solution. Right? You want that. So let’s invent a new language. Say, let’s define \nH(t)\n𝐻\n(\n𝑡\n)\n to be the smallest positive solution of \ncos(x)=tx\ncos\n⁡\n(\n𝑥\n)\n=\n𝑡\n𝑥\n. And now the equation \ncos(x)=x\ncos\n⁡\n(\n𝑥\n)\n=\n𝑥\n has a beautiful explicit solution: it is \nx=H(1)\n𝑥\n=\n𝐻\n(\n1\n)\n.\n\nStill dissatisfied? Feel like I’m cheating? I’m not, I did exactly what you asked me to do. Do you feel that the function \nH\n𝐻\n is obscure? Sure, you’re not used to it. Neither am I. But do you think \nx\n−\n−\n√\n𝑥\n is better? Why? Because your calculator has a \n⋅\n√\n⋅\n button? Casio can make a calculator with an \nH\n𝐻\n button. It works. Punch a number, press that button, get an answer.\n\nThere’s nothing fundamentally more “explicit” about \narccos\narccos\n or \nln\nln\n or any such function. They can be computed for any input with any desired precision.

The way to go around this problem is to find a way to pick a representative set for each class.\n\nWith the Axiom of Choice (AC) every set can be well ordered, hence it is bijective to an ordinal, and its cardinal can be defined as the minimum ordinal that is bijective to the set. Unfortunately, this definition does not work in the absence of the AC, but we can still find a representative set for each cardinal by using Scott's trick \n(ST) if we assume the Axiom of regularity\n (AR).

The pointe shoes that you see gracefully arcing across the stage? They're like elegant little torture devices crafted with satin and ribbon.\n\nThe most iconic ballet shoe, the pointe shoe, forces the foot into an unnatural position, requiring the ballerina to dance on the tips of their toes. This prolonged and repeated strain can change the structure of the feet immensely. Over time, ballerinas can suffer from callouses, bunions, and, in some cases, a completely altered foot shape.\n\nNow, let’s set the scene: I'm from Portland, OR, and while we are known for more alternative pursuits, we do appreciate the classical arts here. I recall meeting a ballet instructor once at an art event in the Pearl District. She had the battle scars to show for her dedication: her feet were a map of her profession, with each line telling a story of performances past.\n\nThe bones can become deformed, the toes can bend to accommodate the continuous pressure, and if not managed properly with the right care and therapy, it can lead to chronic pain and even joint problems. Ballerinas will tell you about their relationship with their feet with a mix of pride and wistfulness—for many, the pursuit of their craft will continue despite the pain.\n\nThe shoe itself is designed to fit snugly, to allow for those ethereal moments on stage where a ballerina seems to defy gravity. But snugness borders on restrictive, and over time, well, you get a transformation that is less Cinderella and more Black Swan.\n\nI remember once walking through the Portland Saturday Market and spotting a dance troupe performing. Among the group was a girl probably in her teens—an obvious talent holding poise with every pirouette. After the performance, she slipped off her pointe shoes, and even from a distance, I could see her wince.\n\nSo to answer the question, ballet shoes don’t just transform the shape of ballerinas’ feet; they reshape the very path of a ballerina’s career. While not every dancer will experience dramatic changes, many will tell you that despite the risks, the opportunity to express themselves through this time-honored tradition is worth the physical cost.\n\nThey are the unsung heroes of the art world, whose every step, every jump, is a testament to their strength—not just the emotional, but the incredible physical resilience it takes to float like a feather and look as though it's all effortless."}

General relativity also required heavy use of tensors, sort of a matrix algebra on steroids. It’s not for the faint-hearted.

It consists of a cube made up of smaller cubes, called cubies, each with a different color on every side. The goal is to rearrange the colored cubies so that each face of the cube has one solid color. To solve the Rubik's Cube you must learn some basic algorithms and strategies.\n\nThe first step to solving the Rubik's cube is finding out how it works. You need to understand that there are three layers in the cube - Up/Down, Left/Right, and Front/Back - and each layer has nine cubes, or cubies. Each cubie can rotate around its own axis and this movement affects other cubies in the same layer or adjacent layer. So for example turning one of the Up/Down-layer will change all of the Up/Down-layer and part of the Left/Right-layer as well.\n\nNext you must learn about eight different algorithms - four for completing each edge piece in its correct position and orientation, two more for placing corner pieces correctly in their respective positions on their respective faces, and two additional algorithms for orienting those corner pieces correctly while still maintaining their correct positions from before. Once you have mastered these eight algorithms then you will have what’s necessary to complete most simple 3x3x3 Rubik's cubes.\n\nThen comes practice! Using your knowledge of how it works combined with your understanding of the eight basic algorithms, begin solving by starting at one side and moving clockwise (or counterclockwise): start with one face (e.g., Front) being solved and by using your algorithm knowledge complete that face properly; move onto another unsolved face (e.g., Right) using an appropriate algorithm; continue moving clockwise throughout all six faces until they are all completed accordingly; use any remaining left over moves to solve another unsolved face if needed; repeat steps 3–5 until no leftover moves remain; when finished with all six faces move onto solving any unsolved edges or corners by repeating steps 2–6 as necessary; when finished with edges & corners repeat steps 3–7 until all edges & corners are placed correctly on all faces; finally use any necessary moves to orient everything properly while still maintaining Position integrity from before – solution accomplished!\n\nWith practice you can eventually be able to solve a standard 3x3x3 Cube faster than anyone who does not have an understanding or knowledge about how it works, algorithms used, etc… In fact people have even developed ways to solve it blindfolded! By following these steps you should now know how to solve a Rubik's Cube as efficiently as possible!"}

I can only imagine how much money I would save if I could harness the light.\n\nWasp - The name of this wasp I didn't find, but it has the most interesting ability in this list. It can convert light into electricity. Is not know what for it can use it, but hey, it has an electricity superpower! Though efficient is less than 0.4%."}

Why don't they just use numbers?,'\n',Letters (that is, variables) are pronouns like “it”, “she”, and “he”. They refer to something, typically an unknown number. You can use them in sentences, usually sentences that say one thing is equal to another. Such sentences can be abbreviated using symbols.\n\nFor example, if you know 3 times some number is equal to 36 more than it, you can write that as \n3x=36+x\n3\n𝑥\n=\n36\n+\n𝑥\n where \nx\n𝑥\n is the pronoun which refers to that number. The nice thing about equations is that you can simplify them to find the value of \nx.\n𝑥\n.\n In this case, the first stage of simplification turns the equation into \n2x=36,\n2\n𝑥\n=\n36\n,\n and the next stage \nx=18\n𝑥\n=\n18\n gives the answer.\n\nFor a long time, only one unknown was used. In the Middle Ages in Italy, it was called cosa, the thing. In the 1500s when symbolic algebra was developed, letters were used to name different things, so you could have more than one unknown."}
