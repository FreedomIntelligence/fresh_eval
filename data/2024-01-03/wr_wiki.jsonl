{"date": "2024-01-03-18-28", "error": false, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_House_(New_York)", "text_blocks": "The Turner House in Pittsford, Monroe County, New York is a Greek Revival house, which was built around 1840 in Henrietta, New York.[1] Richard and Nancy Turner bought the house in 1956 and paid for moving the house from Henrietta to a nearby location in Pittsford.[2] The house is located on an estate of 6 acres (2.428 hectares) with a garden, designed and developed in the 1960s by the famous landscape architect Fletcher Steele. The garden was Steele's last major landscaping project.[3]\n\nElihu Kirby House[edit]\n\nWhat is now called the \"Turner House\" was formerly called the \"Elihu Kirby House\". At the age of nineteen, Elihu Kirby (1801–1866) came to Henrietta, New York and by his late twenties became a success in general merchandising. His imposing house was completed by the early 1840s and he lived there until his death. After his death, his family sold the house.[4][5][6]\n\nRelocation[edit]\n\nIn the early 1950s Richard and Nancy Turner settled in Rochester, New York. The couple, interested in historical preservation, bought the Elihu Kirby House and in 1956 decided that area near the historic house was becoming too commercialized. Therefore, they hired a Weedsport company to move the structure to a vacant lot they owned in Pittsford.[7] (The vacant lot purchased by the Turners was selected by the landscape architect Katherine Wilson Rahn[2] (1915–1992), a Fellow of the American Society of Landscape Architects.[8] A barren cornfield and an abandoned quarry occupied the vacant lot.[9]) The company's workers cut the structure into two sections, each weighing roughly 40 tons.[2] The two section were transported by two trailers to the new location, which was about 3½ miles (5.63 km) away from the old location. The transportation took 10 days,[7] because power lines had to be avoided, the load weight was too much for some roads, and the two trailers had to be pulled over some roadless land. The transportation gained some press coverage, especially when one of the structure-hauling trailers became mired in the mud of a cornfield[7] and when one power line was severed. The downed power line caused some baseball fans to lose their television coverage of a World Series game.[2] However, the transportation was a success, and the two structural sections were successfully rejoined.[7]\n\nLandscaping by Fletcher Steele[edit]\n\nIn the 1960s the Turners hired Fletcher Steele, who was living in Pittsford, to design a garden for the grounds of the relocated house. Most of the garden's original development occurred from 1964 to 1968.[3]\n\nFor the Turner House in 1963, the landscape architect Katherine Wilson Rahn designed and supervised the creation a long, straight drive bordered by sugar maples. The drive leads to a forecourt with a circular turnaround. In 1964 Richard L. Turner commissioned Steele to design a garden for the 6-acre estate. Steele provided a bilaterally symmetrical plan inspired by the gardens of the Châteaux de Vaux-le-Vicomte, the Château de Sceaux, and the Palace of Versailles. Steele's design balanced geometric formality with an extraordinary variety of plant species. The garden's North Vista has a large outdoor room set amid towering trees, mid-sized flowering trees including hawthorn (Crataegus, dogwood (Cornus), and shadblow {Amelanchier), and shrubbery including vintage rose bushes. The culmination of the North Vista is a circular reflecting pool surrounded by a semicircle of towering cedar trees. However, at the time of Steele's death in 1971, several areas of the 6-acre estate had not been landscaped. Although she respected Steele's design, Nancy Turner commissioned an indoor swimming pool, where she swam each morning. She also commissioned a birch-tree allée in an undeveloped section of the property. The allée was designed by the Rochester-based landscape architect Carolyn Marsh Lindsay[2] (b. 1932), who was in 1989–1990 the president of the American Horticultural Society.[10]\n\nIn 2001 Melissa McGrain and her husband Andrew Stern moved to Pittsford and purchased the Turner House. They constructed a new garage, connected to the house by a glaased-in walkway, and transformed the Turners' former garage (originally, the carriage house) into a guesthouse for overnight visitors. After a few years, Melissa McGrain focused her attention on the garden. She studied Steele's original plans and plant lists, established a team of gardeners, and supervised restorative work on the garden's North Vista. She added a six-foot deep koi pool, with sluiceway and a waterfall, to the site of the Turners' former vegetable garden. She also added some monumental bronze passenger pigeons bordering on Steele's reflecting pool. The bronzes were the work of her brother, the artist Todd McGrain.[2]\n\nMelissa McGrain became a pen pal of Nancy Turner. who supplied valuable advice and interesting knowledge about Steele and the Turners' garden.[9] Nancy Turner was also a valuable source of advice and knowledge for Robin Karson, the author of the 2003 book Fletcher Steele, Landscape Architect: An Account of the Gardenmaker's Life, 1885-1971.[11]\n\nNancy Turner was a member of the Allyn's Creek Garden Club, which in 1937 became a chapter of the Garden Club of America (GCA). In 1982, the GCA honored both Nancy and Richard Turner by awarding them the Mrs. Oakley Thorne Medal for \"outstanding garden design in which they have created a magnificen harmony of house to garden\"[12] in their implementation of Fletcher Steele's garden design.[7] Nancy Turner served a term as GCA vice-president.[2]\n\nRichard L. Turner[edit]\n\nRichard Lazear Turner (1925–1986) was a lawyer and corporate executive. Born in Huntington, West Virginia, he served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1943 to 1946. After graduating with a bachelor's degree from Yale University in 1948 and with a law degree from Yale Law School in 1951, he became an associate and then a partner in a law firm in Rochester, New York. He married Nancy Riford in June 1951. At Rochester's Schlegel Corporation, he chaired the corporate board from 1962 to 1986, served as CEO from 1964 to 1986, and served as president from 1972 to 1986. He was a trustee of the Rochester Museum and Science Center and also a trustee of the Genesee Country Village and Museum.[13] In his memory, his widow Nancy R. Turner established in 1988 the Richard L. Turner Professorship of Humanities at the University of Rochester. Appointment to the Turner Professorship lasts for 5 years.[14]\n\nNancy R. Turner[edit]\n\nNancy Elena Riford (1928–2018) was born on dairy farm in Auburn, Cayuga County, New York. In 1950 she graduated with a bachelor's degree in theater from Smith College. After their 1951 marriage, Richard and Nancy Turner moved to Rochester. She spent more than 50 years in the Rochester area, where she participated in many charitable organizations — particularly those reflecting her interest in the arts, gardening, landscape architecture, and historic preservation. She did important volunteer work for the University of Rochester — particularly, the Memorial Art Gallery and the George Eastman House and Museum (where in th 1980s she led the restoration of its historic gardens). She also assisted the Rochester Museum and Science Center, the Genesee Country Village and Museum, the Hochstein School of Music and Dance and the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra. She was the founding president of the Library of American Landscape History[15] (which became a leading publisher of books about American landscape architecture.[16]\n\nShe moved in 2004 to New York City and in 2012 to a retirement community in Essex, Connecticut. Upon her death, Nancy Riford Turner was survived by two sons, two daughters, nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.[15]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"Nancy Turner obituary\".

It was established in the territory of the former Krzyki district.\n\nThe district includes the area of the former villages of Klein Tschansch (Księże Małe), Groß Tschansch (Księże Wielkie), Schwentnig (Świątniki), Ottwitz (Opatowice), Pirscham (Bierdzany) and the settlement of Neuhaus (Nowy Dom) incorporated to Breslau (Wrocław) on April 1, 1928.\n\nName[edit]\n\nThe settlement of Księże Wielkie was first recorded in the mid-12th century under the names Chenese, Kenese, Sansin, and Czanschin majus. The names Czanschin minus and paruum Czanschyn were used to refer to Księże Małe in the 14th century.[2]\n\nThe names of the settlements come from the same root as the modern-day Polish word 'książę' ('prince'), resulting from the fact that the settlements belonged to the prince. Therefore, the original Polish name was Knięże, which later became Księżno and eventually Księże. The phonetically Germanized names of the settlements were Klein Tschansch and Groß Tschansch, which were later changed to Klein and Groß Ohlewiesen ('Ohlau meadows') during the Nazi era, in order to remove traces of their Polish origin.[2]\n\nFor two years after the war, due to misconstruction of medieval records, the settlements of Tschansch were renamed to Mały Ciążyn and Wielki Ciążyn.[2][3] The name was later reverted to Księże.\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nWorks on the modernist neighborhood in Tschansch began in 1924 with the creation of a master plan for Breslau at the City Development Office under the direction of Fritz Behrendt in cooperation with Heinrich Knipping. The final urban planning assumptions for Klein and Groß Tschansch were made in January 1925, followed by the final design of the settlement in Klein Tschansch on April 26, 1928.[2]\n\nIn 1991, after reforms in the administrative division of Wrocław, Księże became one of the city's 48 districts.[4]\n\nThe district was heavily affected by the 1997 Central European flood.[2]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"Liczba mieszkańców zameldowanych we Wrocławiu w podziale na Osiedla – stan na 31 grudnia 2022 r.\"\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d e \"Odkrywamy Wrocław: Modernistyczne osiedle na Księżu Małym\". www.tuwroclaw.com (in Polish).

Dreifus was born on 18 November 1812 in Endingen as the son of Getsch Marum Dreyfus. His maternal grandfather was Rabbi Abraham Ris. Following a traditional Jewish upbringing, he attended the Talmud College in Breisach at the age of fourteen. He continued his education at the Protestant teachers' seminary in Karlsruhe (today the Pädagogische Hochschule Karlsruhe). In 1831, after passing the teacher training examination in Aarau, he took over the position of Hebrew teacher at the newly founded Israelite primary school in Endingen. Alongside this, he continued his education at the cantonal school in Aarau, and in 1834 he was enrolled for a short time at the University of Basel.[1] He was the first Swiss Jew to do so.[2]\n\nHe soon decided to devote himself entirely to teaching. One summer he taught at the Fellenberg Institute in Hofwil and then in Hagenthal in Alsace. Having been declared the first Jew eligible to become head teacher, he took that position at the newly organised Israelite school in Endingen.[3] He continued this role for numerous years, with brief interruptions in 1843 and 1861, when he worked as a religion teacher for the Jewish community in Geneva, and as editor of the Winterthurer Landbote respectively. He then accepted a position in Frankfurt am Main, where he was commissioned by the banker Hahn to establish a Jewish agricultural school.[4] Dreyfus returned to Switzerland in 1872 and worked as a religion teacher in Zurich until 1876.\n\nImpact  [edit]\n\nMarkus G. Dreyfus devoted his life to the education of Jewish youth in accordance with the times. In addition, he was active in the struggle for the emancipation of Jews in Switzerland.[2] His pedagogy was based on the reform schools of the German-Jewish Enlightenment. The First Hebrew Reading Booklet, which he wrote, was published in several editions.  \n\nIn 1839, Dreyfus founded the Poel tow craftsmen's association to support Jewish apprentices. This was shortly after Swiss restrictions for Jews were lifted in various professional fields. The attempt to establish an agricultural school in Endingen failed due to lack of funds. In addition to his work as a teacher, Dreyfus was also active as a journalist and maintained contact with influential representatives of liberal Judaism, such as Rabbi Ludwig Philippson, the pioneer of Reform Judaism Abraham Geiger and the historian Isaak Marcus Jost.[3]\n\nBetween 1839 and 1866, Dreyfus wrote several petitions to the canton of Aargau and to the Swiss federal government concerning the civil equality of Jews. In 1860, he published Zur Würdigung des Judenthums unter seinen Nichtbekennern (On the Appreciation of Judaism among its Non-Confessors), in which he presented the principles of Judaism in dialogue form, countering popular attacks. Two years later a proposed law for the emancipation of Jews in Switzerland was rejected, and the struggle continued until 1866 when a referendum finally brought the civil equality Dreyfus had fought for.[2] In Aargau, some local restrictions on regional voting remained even until 1874.\n\nSee also[edit]\nHistory of the Jews in Switzerland\nReferences[edit]\n^ According to Kaufmann (Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz) at the Faculty of Philosophy, according to Guggenheim-Grünberg (1958) at the Faculty of Medicine.\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c Battegay, Caspar; Lubrich, Naomi (2018).

In 1975 he became a master student of Joseph Beuys. This was followed by a study visit to Zurich. He then lived briefly in Aachen before moving back to his parents' house in Stolberg.\n\nRitzerfeld made his first 'artistic attempts' in the style of the Vienna School of fantastic realism in 1968; The model was the Viennese painter Ernst Fuchs.Shortly afterwards he turned to expressionism; with some of his favourite subjects being portraits, landscapes and interiors. As a 20-year-old he was able to see Beuys on television; an initial spark that prompted Ritzerfeld be interested in his works. In the very first year of the “Beuys period” he turned around to the classical style of the Düsseldorf School of painting, with Andreas Achenbach being particularly influential. Through the metaphysical painting of Carlo Carrà and the naive peasant painting of Mirko Virius, he finally arrived at painting with an organic purpose. He increasingly favoured architectural painting: “I painted what was going on in a city around me and tried to make this visible through abstract forms.” Since then he has found his own “grammar”, which is more precise in its image structure than that of the Neue Wilden.\n\nFrom 1994, Ritzerfeld had a shared studio with his fellow artist Angelika Kühnen [de], first in Breinig, then in the Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum and since 2012 in Stolberg-Büsbach (European Art Court). Ritzerfeld's work is represented in numerous collections and museums including in the Suermondt-Ludwig Museum in Aachen,  which, among other things, received the collection of Peter Lacroix [de] with numerous pictures by Ritzerfeld as a donation in 2006.\n\nHartmut Ritzerfeld, along with Win Braun [de] as well as Emil Sorge [de] and Franz-Bernd Becker [de], was one of the founders of the Eifelmaler [de] group.\n\nDeath[edit]\n\nRitzerfeld was hit by a car in Büsbach in early December 2023. In the traffic accident he suffered a laceration to his head, a traumatic brain injury and a fractured pelvis.[1] He died from his injuries on January 1, 2024 in Stolberg Bethlehem Hospital [de].[2][3][4]\n\nExhibitions[edit]\n\nWorks by Hartmut Ritzerfeld have been shown in numerous exhibitions, especially in Germany:\n\n1976 Galerie Arno Kohnen, Düsseldorf\n1986–1989 Leopold-Hoesch-Museum [de], Düren, Katalog\n1986–1989 Neue Galerie, Sammlung Ludwig, Aachen\n1988 Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum, Aachen\n1988 Kunstmuseum Bonn\n1988 Städtisches Museum Ulm\n1988 Landesmuseum für Kunst- und Kulturgeschichte, Oldenburg\n1988 Neue Galerie, Sammlung Murken, Meerbusch\n1989 Museum Wiesbaden\n1989–1998 Städtische Galerie Regensburg\n1995–2000 Kunst und Breinig, Solberg\n1993 Leopold-Hoesch-Museum [de], Düren\n1997–1998 Ludwig Forum für internationale Kunst, Aachen\n1998 Haubrichforum, Köln\n1998 Kunsthalle Barmen\n1998 Von der Heydt-Museum, Wuppertal\n1998 Kunstmuseum Thun, Schweiz\n1998 Städtische Galerie Albstadt\n1999 Landgericht Aachen\n1999 Städtische Galerie Aschaffenburg\n1999 Städtische Galerie Delmenhorst, Haus Coburg\n2000 Schloss Babenhausen, Hessischer Kulturverein\n2000–2001 Städtisches Museum Leverkusen, Schloss Morsbroich\n2001 Museum Zitadelle, Jülich\n2002 Dorotheum-Palais, Wien, Österreich\n2004 Museum Zinkhütter Hof, Stolberg\n2004 Museumsinsel Lüttenheid, Klaus Groth Museum, Heide\n2007 La otra Galerià, Port d’Andratx, Mallorca, Spanien\n2007 Associacio Cultural, „Sa Taronja“, Port d’Andratx, Mallorca, Spanien\n2008 Galerie Sommer, Graz, Österreich\n2008 Galerie S, Aachen\n2008 Planet Vivid Gallery, Frankfurt a. M.\n2009 PostForum, Düren\n2020 Burg Stolberg [de], Stolberg\nExternal links[edit]\nHartmut Ritzerfeld, 4 akustische Arbeiten\nKurzbiografie, Abbildungen\nKurzbiografie, Galerie Marco Jansen\nAbbildungen\nWebseite Hartmut Ritzerfeld\nReferences[edit]\n^ Dirk Müller (2023-12-07). \"Bangen um den Stolberger Maler Hacky Ritzerfeld\". aachener-zeitung.de.

The term Ahir is often seen as synonymous with Yadav.[1][2] The Mahabharata and other authori-tative works use the three terms-Ahir, Yadav and Gopa synonymous.[3][4]\n\nHowever, most books publiced as recently as 2001, 2005, propogates the dubious theories generated based on old new paper articles and court records, that present day Yadav caste is merely renamed Ahirs who switched their identity in 1922 to Yadav as part of Sanskritization movement of certain Hindu castes. The facts mentioned in the Ahir taken a false identitiy of Yadav is incorrect. And these false informations are propogated in recently publised books, which no authority in subject. The book contents are based on news paper articles and courts records, whose validities are as genuine as a lawyer's statement.\n\nThe British census in 1881, half century before any Sanskritization movement, the census mentions Yadavs as Ahirs. It says \"The Yadavs, who in their turn are identified with the Ahirs and Gaolis, were the dominant race at that time.[5]\n\nHemachandra, in the Dyashraya-Kavya, describe the Ahir King Graharipu, ruling at Vanthali near Junagadh, as an Ahir and a Yadav. Again, many remains of Khandesh (historical stronghold of Ahirs) are popularly believed to be of Gawli Raj, which archaeologically belongs to the Yadvas of Devgiri. Hence, it is concluded that Yadavs of Devagiri were actually Ahirs. This receives some support from the fact that Yaduvanshis even now are one of the most important sub-divisions of the Ahirs.[6]\n\nAccording to Historian T Padmaja, the Ahirs migrated to Tamil Nadu and established their kingdoms and in inscriptions these Ahirs mention they are from Yadav lineage.[7]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ Kumar, Ravinder (1984).

Upon its debut in 2014 the show was known as Alexandra de noche (Alexandra at night) and aired as a late-night talk show before the station decided to move the show to the midday time-slot in 2017.[1]\n\nHistory[edit]\nAlexandra de noche[edit]\n\nOriginally known as Alexandra de noche (Alexandra at night) the show premiered on January 13, 2014 and aired weekdays at the 10:30 p.m. spot right after the nighttime edition of Telenoticias. The original version of Alexandra de noche followed the late-night talk show and had a half hour duration. During the show, Fuentes would open with a short monologue followed by an interview with a guest which would fill the rest of the program. The show debuted to moderate success for the station getting a ratings boost for the late-night spot and coming in second place behind WAPA-TV.[2][3]\n\nTelemundo de noche[edit]\n\nIn August 2016, it was announced that Alexandra Fuentes would be leaving the show to support her husband David Bernier as he ran for governor in the 2016 Puerto Rican general election. Fuentes' last show aired on Friday, September 2nd, 2016, and featured guests Raymond Arrieta, Silverio Pérez, Papo Brenes and WKAQ-TV president José Cancela. [4][5]\n\nAfter Fuentes' exit her last name was dropped from the show's title and the show became Telemundo de noche (Telemundo at night) and would feature a revolving door of guests hosts such as, Myraida Chaves, Daniela Droz and Alfonsina Molinari. During this period the show also began airing at 11:00 p.m. instead of 10:30 p.m.[6]\n\nAfter the results of the 2016 Puerto Rican general election ended in a loss for Bernier, Fuentes announced on November 16, 2016, that she would be returning to the show as soon as November 30, 2016.[7][8]\n\nAlexandra a las 12[edit]\n\nOn December 19, 2016, WKAQ-TV announced that the show would be moving time-slots and would now become the station's new midday variety show, this would be the first time the station would have a midday show since the cancellation of El Show de las 12 in 2005. The new version of the show would now be called Alexandra a las 12 (Alexandra at noon) and would be expanded from a half hour to an hour to accommodate news segments, weather report segments and political analysis segments. The new format of the show would serve as an extension of the 11:00 a.m. broadcast of Telenoticias and would combine the previously mentioned elements of the newscasts with Fuentes' monologues, interviews and comedy segments. The first episode of Alexandra a las 12 aired on January 16, 2017.[9][10]\n\nOn March 29, 2021, WKAQ announced that it would once again extend Alexandra a las 12 by adding a half hour to the show. The show would now start at 11:30 a.m. and would put it in direct competition with WAPA-TV's midday show Pegate al mediodia. The first episode of Alexandra at 11:30 a.m. aired on April 12, 2021.[11][12]\n\nOn January 2, 2024 it was announced that the show would debut a new look. Among the changes announced by the station it would be a new studio and a new space for the sketch comedy portion of the show. The changes are set to go into effect when Fuentes' returns from her holiday vacation on January 8, 2024. The changes are being lauded as a \"new season\" for the program.[13][14]\n\nOn-air staff[edit]\nAlexandra Fuentes, host\nIvonne Solla Cabrea, news anchor Telenoticias\nCarlos Díaz Olivo, political analysis\nLuis Pabón Roca, political analysis\nHerbet Cruz, comedian\nVictor Alicea, comedian\nCarmen Nydia Velázquez, comedian\nEyra Agüero, comedian\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"\"Alexandra De Noche\" ¡Estrena en Telemundo Puerto Rico!\".

The administration contains 12 sub-cities, 36 districts and 40 rural kebeles with its seat located in Saris area in Addis Ababa.[1]\n\nWhile the plan is intended to expand rapid urbanization, critics argue that such measures may fail to persist. It has been viewed that this plan can cause inequalities in both regional resources and deter overall development.[2] The project was criticized by several media and human rights groups and politicians of violating regional integrity and the constitutional rights of Oromo people, increasing mass house demolition that belonged to Amhara ethnic group and to justify Oromization.[3][4]\n\nPrograms[edit]\n\nThe project was announced on 22 October 2022 with consolidating six Oromia towns into outskirt of Addis Ababa. A doughnut-shaped enclave expected to contribute growth of Addis Ababa while it negatively impacts the population density in the boundaries.[5] In December 2022, the Oromia Region organized six cities on Sheger City with its administration office located in Saris area. Teshome Adugna has been the mayor of Sheger City. The new administration has 12 sub-cities, 36 districts and 40 rural kebeles and served as county administration of Ethiopia. According to the Ethiopian Reporter local news reporter Gugsa Dejene, the administration caused regional disparity while contributing development on infrastructure and economic and social affairs.[6][7]\n\nControversy[edit]\n\nThere is a huge concern because of the Oromia government is trying to encircle Addis Ababa and is an outset of government mass house demolition of civilians, mostly belonged to non-Oromo groups. It has been feared that the lack transparency can create corruption regarding allocation of land and Amharas are systematically displaced by the demolition and the victimization of Amhara can caused armed mobilization.[8]\n\nLeaders of the Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC) criticized the plan due to violating constitutional and the rights of Oromo people.[5] According to the the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) report in March 2023, the house demolition in Sheger City is illegal and against the humans rights and international law [9]\n\nSee also[edit]\nHouse demolition in Ethiopia under Abiy Ahmed rule\nOromia–Addis Ababa relations\nReferences[edit]\n^ Tasfaye, Ermias (2023-04-12). \"Opposition to Oromia megacities echoes Ethiopia's master plan turmoil\".

It was during a vacation after his military enlistment that he watched Quentin Tarantino's film Reservoir Dogs which solidified his decision to pursue a career in film directing.[1][2]\n\nAfter completing his military service, Kang made his first short film called Charlie Brown in 1996. Shot on 16mm film and edited using the Premier video editing program, the film was invited and screened at a university short film festival. Drawing from his filmmaking experience, Kang wrote a book titled \"Computer Image Work.\" Using his work during this period as a portfolio, he decided to further his studies at the American Academy of Arts in San Francisco, after graduating from college.[1][2]\n\nDuring his time at the American Academy of Arts, Kang directed a short thriller called \"Negative Image,\" which showcased a story of a man stalking a woman. The film was screened at the Indie Forum and the Busan International Short Film Festival in Korea. Following this, Kang worked on his first feature-length screenplay, \"Foucault's Short Film,\" but unfortunately, the project failed to secure investment.[1][2]\n\nCareer[edit]\n\nKang then returned to Korea and attempted to develop his novel, \"Moebius,\" but faced another setback when his investment company went bankrupt. These failures led Kang to temporarily step away from filmmaking and start his own production company, focusing on producing music videos and other visual works.[1][2]\n\nIn 2003, Kang made a comeback to the film industry by joining the directing department in director Kim Seong-su's film Please Teach Me English. However, he faced yet another downturn and had to take on other jobs to support himself. In 2006, he directed the documentary \"Shin Jung-hyun's Last Concert,\" which revolved around retired singer Shin Jung-hyun. The film was invited to the 3rd Jecheon International Film Festival.[1][2]\n\nThrough a mutual acquaintance, Kang Yun-seong established a close relationship with actor Ma Dong-seok, who had just finished working on Army of Heaven. In 2012, the two collaborated on the feature film The Outlaws, which was based on real events. The Outlaws was released in 2017 and received tremendous success. By December 1, the film had garnered 6.87 million admissions and grossed US$51.8 million, making it the third highest-grossing domestic film of the year in South Korea and the 3rd highest-grossing domestic film of the year in South Korea and the third best-selling R-rated Korean film of all time.[3][4]\n\nKang then ventured to OTT dramas with series Big Bet. It is highly anticipated because it marks Choi Min-shik first drama series appearance in 26 years since Love and Separation in 1997.[5] The series was released on Disney+ as an original series with two seasons comprising eight episodes each. First season was released on December 21, 2022. Second season was released in February 2023.[6][7] Seventy percent of the filming was conducted in the Philippines.[8]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nFilmmaking roles[edit]\nShort Film[edit]\nShort film filmmaking credits[9]\nYear\tTitle\tCredited as\tRef.\nEnglish\tKorean\tDirector\tScriptwriter\tProducer\n1998\tNegative Image\t네가티브 이미지\tKang Yun-seong\tKang Yun-seong\tKang Yun-seong\t\n2019\t100X100\tKang Yun-seong\tKang Yun-seong\t—\t\n2023\tHongkong, within Me\t내 안에 홍콩이 있다\tKang Yun-seong\tKang Yun-seong\tKang Yun-seong\t\nFeature film[edit]\nFeature film filmmaking credits[9]\nYear\tTitle\tCredited as\tRef.\nEnglish\tKorean\tDirector\tScriptwriter\tCreator\n2007\tShin Joong-hyeon's Last Concert\t신중현의 라스트 콘서트\tKang Yun-seong\t\t\t[10]\n2017\tThe Outlaws\t범죄도시\tKang Yun-seong\t[11][12]\n2019\tLong Live The King\t롱 리브 더 킹: 목포 영웅\tKang Yun-seong\t[13]\n2022\tThe Roundup\t범죄도시 2\tLee Sang-yong\tKim Min-seong\tKang Yun-seong\t[14][15]\nMen of Plastic\t압꾸정\tLim Jin-sun\tKang Yun-seong\t\t[16][17][18]\n2023\tThe Roundup: No Way Out\t범죄도시 3\tLee Sang-yong\tKim Min-seong, Cha Woo-jin\tKang Yun-seong\t[19]\nTBA\tThe Roundup: Punishment\t범죄도시 4\tTBA\tTBA\t[20]\nThe Roundup 5\t범죄도시 5\nWeb series[edit]\nWeb series filmmaking credits[9]\nYear\tTitle\tNetwork\tCredited as\tRef.\nEnglish\tKorean\tDirector\tScriptwriter\n2022\tBig Bet\t카지노\tDisney+\tYes\tYes\t[21][22]\nActing roles[edit]\nActing credit(s)[9]\nYear\tTitle\tRole\tRef.\nEnglish\tKorean\n2002\tBaby Alone\t유아독존\tPolice\t[9]\n2003\tPlease Teach Me English\t영어완전정복\tBar Host\n2017\tThe Night View of the Ocean in Yeosu\t여수 밤바다\tJi-seok's friend\n2020\tLand of Holy Grace\t성혜의 나라\tInterviewer\nDouble Patty\t더블패티\tInstructor\nAccolades[edit]\nAwards and nominations[edit]\nName of the award ceremony, year presented, category, nominee(s) of the award, and the result of the nomination\nAward ceremony\tYear\tCategory\tNominee / Work\tResult\tRef.\n37th Korean Association of Film Critics Awards\t2017\tTop 10 Films\tThe Outlaws\tWon\t[23]\nBest New Director\tWon\n38th Blue Dragon Film Awards\t2017\tBest New Director\tNominated\t[24]\nBest Technical Achievement-Stunts\tNominated\nBest Film Editing\tNominated\n54th Baeksang Arts Awards\t2018\tBest New Director\tWon\t[25][26]\nBest Screenplay\tNominated\n23rd Chunsa Film Art Awards\t2017\tNominated\t[27][28]\nBest New Director\tWon\n27th Buil Film Awards\t2017\tBest New Director\tNominated\t[29]\n55th Grand Bell Awards\t2017\tBest New Director\tNominated\t[30]\nBest Planning\tNominated\n18th Director's Cut Awards\t2017\tBest New Director\tWon\t[31]\nBlue Dragon Series Awards\t2023\tBest Drama\tBig Bet\tWon\t[32]\nDirector's Cut Awards\t2023\tBest Director in Television\tKang Yoon-sung, Nam Gi-hoon\tNominated\t[33]\nSeoul International Drama Awards\t2023\tGolden Bird Prize for Program\tBig Bet\tWon\t[34]\nListicle[edit]\nName of publisher, year listed, name of listicle, and placement\nPublisher\tYear\tList\tPlacement\tRef.\nCine21\t2022\tSeries Director of the Year\tWon\t[35]\nNotes[edit]\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d e \"강윤성 감독 - 데뷔 감독 맞아? 17년 만에 첫 영화를 만들기까지\". 씨네21 (in Korean). 2017-11-29.

The film is based on the novel of the same title by Risa Saraswati.\n\nPlot[edit]\n\nLanggir Janaka is a young woman who has a lot of hatred towards other people. Since Aba, Langgir's father, died when he was little, Langgir felt that Ambu, his mother, hated him, even after she remarried Om Udin and gave Langgir a younger sibling named Bakula Borneo. Langgir is jealous of his three friends, Lintang Kasih, Sekar Tanjung, and Francisca Inggrid, all part of the Putri Sejagat gang, who he considers living perfect lives. The only person Langgir loves is Abimanyu, a young man he has had a crush on for a long time, but Langgir doesn't have the courage to express what's in his heart.\n\nBefore Lintang went to Singapore, she invited Putri Sejagat to stay at her uncle's villa, Karma Rinjani. When their car was blocked by a damaged bridge, they were forced to walk several hundred meters to reach the villa. After being cornered in a hut, a woman named Kumalasari appears and guides them to their destination, where they meet the villa's caretaker, Cecep. Abimanyu was waiting there. Ingrid then announced that she and Abimanyu were dating. Hurt, Langgir expressed his hatred towards them before rushing home.\n\nLanggir finds himself lost again and finds the grave of Kumalasari, who apparently died two years ago. Langgir falls into a grave and becomes possessed. Abimanyu followed Langgir, but he had an accident because he was startled by the ghost of Kumalasari. Meanwhile, Lintang, Sekar, and Ingrid are each haunted or possessed by Kumalasari. They learn that, apart from Inggrid, Sekar and Lintang also have secrets: Sekar is an adopted child, while Lintang has a brain tumor and will undergo surgery in Singapore. After Cecep rescues them, Sekar decides that they should all go home and follows Cecep to borrow a car.\n\nAbimanyu regained consciousness at the village Ustaz's house and was immediately warned by him to immediately leave Karma Rinjani, because that place holds a dark history: Kumalasari, the daughter of Rudi, a shaman who lived in a forest hut with his wife, Rosita, committed suicide by jumping from bridge after she was raped by workers working on the villa. Rudi, who is stricken with grief, plans to sacrifice a woman to be possessed by his daughter's soul. His first plan was thwarted by Cecep, who he then killed. Abimanyu finds out that the \"Cecep\" he met earlier is actually Rudi.\n\nSekar catches Rudi undergoing a ritual so that Kumalasari can enter Langgir's body and hears that Rudi chose Langgir because he had so much hatred in his heart. He meets Rosita who is being held captive so as not to interfere with Rudi's plans. They are confronted by Rudi and, after a fierce fight, Sekar manages to kill Rudi. However, the possessed Langgir flees to the city and kills the land buyer who was going to buy the house inherited from Aba. He proceeds to his house and intends to kill Bakula. Before he can do so, Pak Ustaz arrives with Lintang, Inggrid, Abimanyu, Sekar, and Rosita and, assisted by Ambu and Om Udin, manages to free Langgir from Kumalasari's spirit.\n\nSome time later, Langgir, Sekar, Ingrid, and Abimanyu said goodbye to Lintang who was about to leave for Singapore to undergo surgery.\n\nCast[edit]\nShandy Aulia[1] as Langgir Janaka\nJosephine Firmstone as Lintang Kasih\nGabriella Desta as Sekar Tanjung\nDenira Wiraguna as Francisca Inggrid\nNinok Wiryono as Rosita\nMiller Khan as Abimanyu\nBaron Hermanto as Cecep\nWeni Panca as Kumala Sari\nErwin Cortez as Lintang's father\nAbi Canser as Wa Haji\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b Media, Kompas Cyber (2018-05-30). \"Pengalaman Menegangkan Shandy Aulia Saat Masuk ke Lubang Kubur\".

Diego Velasquez serving as its first parish priest. The settlement quickly surpassed Oton in significance, becoming the residence of Spanish officials in the region. The Augustinians took over in 1584, with Fr. Juan Montoya, O.S.A. as the parish priest.[citation needed]\n\nDue to various challenges, including Moro raids and Dutch attacks, the Spaniards eventually relocated to Fort San Pedro in La Punta (Iloilo City Proper). The church, with a history of destruction and reconstruction, has been contemporary, undergoing numerous rebuilds over several centuries.\n\nIn 1868, Fr. Anselmo Avancena initiated the construction of the Convento de Arevalo and the second reconstruction of the church, completed in 1869. Notably, the church features a unique location in the middle of the plaza, distinguishing it from others in the country.[3]\n\nThe image of Santo Niño in Santo Niño de Arevalo Parish Church is believed to be miraculous, providing protection to the townsfolk during attacks, droughts, locust infestations, and other tribulations. A replica is housed in the church, while the original image is kept in the Convento de Arevalo for safekeeping.[citation needed]\n\nOn January 16, 2022, Santo Niño de Arevalo was declared the Archdiocesan Shrine of Santo Niño de Arevalo, and the image was crowned by Jaro Archbishop Jose Romeo Lazo. This declaration marked a significant milestone, making it the third shrine within the archdiocese, alongside St. Vincent Ferrer in Leganes and Our Lady of Fatima in Jaro.[4]\n\nSee also[edit]\nSanto Niño de Cebú\nReferences[edit]\n^ Sornito, Ime (2022-01-22). \"Santo Niño de Arevalo – Iloilo's almost overlooked treasure\".

Looking for more kicks, they barge into the workshop of Emilio Dinelli, a maker of fairground paraphernalia.\n\nThe youths terrorise and humiliate Dinelli. They play, then smash up, a football-themed pinball machine. Discovering Dinelli used to be a stage magician, they force him to entertain them with a vanishing cabinet. One by one Mickey, Ginger and Kip disappear. As Dinelli shuts up his workshop, the faces of the missing boys are seen to appear in the mysteriously repaired football game.\n\nCast[edit]\nWarren Mitchell as Emilio Dinelli\nJohn Malcolm as Mick\nRaymond Armstrong as Ginger\nJohn Challis as Tim\nChristopher Robbie as Kip\nKarol Hagar as the girl\nJoseph Cook as the boy\nVincent Shaw as first bouncer\nTommy Eytle as second bouncer\nPhilip Newman as first detective\nKenneth Laird as second detective\nSheila Barker\nJane Probyn\nDouglas Thorne\nPatricia Quinn\nJanet Lees Price\nMusic[edit]\n\nThe title song, which plays over the end credits, was composed and sung by Ottilie Patterson, accompanied by Chris Barber (bass), Eddie Smith (banjo), Graham Burbidge (drums) and Sonny Boy Williamson (harmonica).[2]\n\nCritical reception[edit]\n\nVariety wrote: \"Filmed on location with direct sound, it lacks punch as an essay in the macabre. Its straggling script has some down-to-earth saltiness. Warren Mitchell ... gives a professional performance and John Malcolm as Mick, chief of the layabouts, is a podgy offbeat character who may do well as a character actor. But these are about all the bouquets that can be tossed to this misfire. Malcolm leads a little gang of streetcorner roughs and they set out in search of mischief. ...The film really starts when they break into the premises to find that it is the workshop of a stage magician who makes novelty sideshows for carnivals. Only Mitchell as the magician provides a performance that creates the intended atmosphere.\"[3]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ Chibnall, Steve; McFarlane, Brian (2009). The British 'B' Film.

The style of their songs are usually considered to be alternative rock[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] and pop rock,[2][4][8][9][10][11] along with less-mentioned post-Britpop,[2][6][12][13] electronic rock,[14][15][16][17] pop,[13][15][18][19] and grunge.[2][4][20] The lyrics of the songs tend to be themed around romance, friendship, life, and abstract thoughts.[21][22][23][24] Most of their songs are written by Ariel.\n\nThe first song they recorded for release is \"Mimpi yang Sempurna\", which was recorded for Musica Studio's compilation album Kisah 2002 Malam (2002). The song was released as a single and helped the album sold 150.000 copies.[25] Peterpan soon joined Musica Studio's and recorded three studio albums, Taman Langit (2003), Bintang di Surga (2004), and Hari yang Cerah (2007); a soundtrack album, Alexandria (2005); and a compilation album, Sebuah Nama, Sebuah Cerita (2008). Due to Andika and Indra's split from the band in 2006, the band dropped the Peterpan name in 2008 and used the band members' names as a placeholder.[26] The initial plan to announce their new name in 2010 was delayed because Ariel was arrested that year due to a celebrity sex tape featuring him.[27][28] During Ariel's time in prison, the band recorded instrumental version of their songs which was released in Suara Lainnya (2012).\n\nAfter Ariel was released from prison, the band announced their new name: Noah, on 2 August 2012.[29] They followed it up with releasing their first song as Noah, \"Separuh Aku\", on 3 August,[30] which helped their debut album as Noah, Seperti Seharusnya (2012), sold over one million copies.[31] In addition to recording new songs, the band re-recorded most of Peterpan's songs in a project titled \"Second Chance\", which consisted of four albums: Second Chance (2014), Taman Langit (2021), Bintang di Surga (2022), and Hari yang Cerah (2022). During Noah era, Ariel's part in songwriting decreased as he said that he had difficulty writing lyrics and the band thus collaborated with other song and book writers to help with the lyrics.[32][33]\n\nSongs recorded as Peterpan (2000–2009)[edit]\nContents\n0–9 · A · B · C · D · H · J · K · L · M · S · T · W · Y\nPeterpan collaborated with Chrisye on \"Menunggumu\" in Chrisye's album, Senyawa (2004). Peterpan and Noah also has covered several Chrisye's song, namely \"Kisah Cintaku\", \"Sendiri Lagi\", and \"Kala Cinta Menggoda\".\nList of released songs, showing title, song writer, lyrics writer, original release and year\nTitle\tSong writer\tLyrics writer\tOriginal release\tYear\tRef.\n\"2 DSD\"[a]\tNazril Irham\tNazril Irham\tBintang di Surga\t2004\t[34]\n\"Ada Apa Denganmu\"\tNazril Irham\tNazril Irham\tBintang di Surga\t2004\t[34]\n\"Aku\"\tNazril Irham\nAndika Naliputra\tNazril Irham\nAndika Naliputra\tBintang di Surga\t2004\t[34]\n\"Aku & Bintang\"[b]\tNazril Irham\tNazril Irham\tTaman Langit\t2003\t[35][36]\n\"Ayah (Aceh)\" (Rinto Harahap cover) (featuring Candil Seurieus)\tRinto Harahap\tRinto Harahap\tDari Hati untuk Aceh\t2005\t[37]\n\"Bebas\"\tNazril Irham\tNazril Irham\tHari yang Cerah\t2007\t[38]\n\"Bintang di Surga\"\tNazril Irham\tNazril Irham\tBintang di Surga\t2004\t[34]\n\"Cobalah Mengerti\"\tLukman Hakim\nNazril Irham\tLukman Hakim\nNazril Irham\tHari yang Cerah\t2007\t[38]\n\"Dan Hilang\"\tNazril Irham\tNazril Irham\tTaman Langit\t2003\t[35]\n\"Di Balik Awan\"\tNazril Irham\tNazril Irham\tHari yang Cerah\t2007\t[38]\n\"Di Belakangku\"[b]\tNazril Irham\tNazril Irham\tBintang di Surga\t2004\t[34][36]\n\"Diatas Normal\"\tNazril Irham\tNazril Irham\tBintang di Surga\t2004\t[34]\n\"Dilema Besar\"\tLukman Hakim\tNazril Irham\tSebuah Nama, Sebuah Cerita\t2008\t[39]\n\"Dunia yang Terlupa\"\tLukman Hakim\tLukman Hakim\tHari yang Cerah\t2007\t[38]\n\"Hari yang Cerah untuk Jiwa yang Sepi\"\tLukman Hakim\nNazril Irham\tNazril Irham\tHari yang Cerah\t2007\t[38]\n\"Jauh Mimpiku\"\tLukman Hakim\nHendra Suhendra\tRyan Reza\nAndika Naliputra\tAlexandria\t2005\t[36]\n\"Khayalan Tingkat Tinggi\"\tNazril Irham\tNazril Irham\tBintang di Surga\t2004\t[34]\n\"Kisah Cintaku\"[c] (Chrisye cover)\tTito Soemarsono\tTito Soemarsono\tSebuah Nama, Sebuah Cerita\t2008\t[39]\n\"Kita Tertawa\"\tLukman Hakim\tNazril Irham\tTaman Langit\t2003\t[35]\n\"Kota Mati\"\tLukman Hakim\nNazril Irham\tLukman Hakim\nNazril Irham\tHari yang Cerah\t2007\t[38]\n\"Ku Katakan Dengan Indah\"[b]\tNazril Irham\tNazril Irham\tBintang di Surga\t2004\t[34][36]\n\"Kupu-Kupu Malam\"[c] (Titiek Puspa cover)\tTitiek Puspa\tTitiek Puspa\tFrom Us to U\t2005\t[39]\n\"Langit Tak Mendengar\"\tLukman Hakim\nNazril Irham\tNazril Irham\tAlexandria\t2005\t[36]\n\"Lihat Langkahku\"\tLukman Hakim\tLukman Hakim\tHari yang Cerah\t2007\t[38]\n\"Marilah Kemari\" (Titiek Puspa cover) (as part of All Artist)\tTitiek Puspa\tTitiek Puspa\tFrom Us to U\t2005\t[40]\n\"Masa Lalu Tertinggal\"\tNazril Irham\nHendra Suhendra\tHendra Suhendra\tBintang di Surga\t2004\t[34]\n\"Melawan Dunia\"\tNazril Irham\tNazril Irham\tHari yang Cerah\t2007\t[38]\n\"Membebaniku\"\tMoh.

This act of kindness enabled D'Silva, who lacked the means to purchase his own equipment, to pursue his passion for drumming.[1] From that point onward, he displayed dedication to his craft.[2]\n\nIn 1965, D'Silva joined forces with Ignatius & His Swing Band as their drummer. Notably, during that same year, he left an impression on the audience with a performance that nearly caused damage to the drum set and left him with a torn T-shirt. As the emergence of beat groups took hold, D'Silva found himself drumming for Ebony, where his talent garnered recognition as the town's premier drummer for weddings and beat shows.[1]\n\nSubsequently, D'Silva embarked on a musical odyssey, lending his drumming prowess to a succession of bands including CIC Band (Raia, Goa), Luis & his Melodians, Radio Serenaders, AVC Pops, and Melody Makers.[1] In 1983, he took a step in his career by establishing his own ensemble, Fantasy, which became one of the most popular dance bands of the 1980s. They performed at numerous weddings and dances, with festivities often commencing at 10 p.m. and extending well into the early hours of the morning in an era devoid of sound restrictions.[2]\n\nIn addition to his drumming prowess, D'Silva held a deep fascination for the traditional Konkani tiatr, a form of musical theater. During his formative years, he ventured into the realm of dramatic arts, participating in various productions and showcasing his vocal abilities through humorous songs. Fortuitously, his brother C. D'Silva, a Konkani actor and singer, provided D'Silva with a platform to nurture his singing talent.[1] His theatrical journey commenced with appearances in Santos de Arossim's Catkar (Cheater) and Casiano D'Costa's tiatr Kuniad (Brother-in-law), and from that point onward, he never wavered in his pursuit of artistic prowess. Notably, D'Silva frequently collaborated with his brother C. D'Silva, who was acclaimed for his versatility in portraying myriad characters on stage.[2]\n\nD'Silva, as a musician, dedicated 37 years of his life to mastering the art of drumming. However, in 2002, he made the difficult decision to relinquish his drumsticks due to disagreements with his band members, who insisted on incorporating recorded music into their performances rather than relying solely on live instrumentation. D'Silva had been integral part of the band Fantasy, which had gained immense popularity as the star attraction at prominent beat shows in Salcete and the now-disbanded Arlem Festival.[1]\n\nFollowing his departure from drumming, D'Silva redirected his focus towards singing Konkani songs for tiatrs (Goa musical dramas) and other musical shows. Demonstrating his talents as a vocalist, J P Perieira of The Navhind Times writes, D'Silva captivated audiences with his own compositions, earning widespread acclaim in various productions under the direction of figures such as Patrick Dourado, Rafael Noel, Prince Jacob, Ben Evangelisto, Oldrin Sequeira Tony Dias, and many others.[2]\n\nWhile D'Silva's musical pursuits afforded him opportunities to perform abroad, including onboard cruise liners with his band, it was his active involvement in the Konkani stage that enabled him to showcase his talents in diverse international settings.[2] Throughout his illustrious career, D'Silva has been unreserved in expressing his deep admiration for Alfred Rose, a Konkani singer, whom he regards as his ultimate idol. D'Silva continues to honor Rose's legacy by incorporating his songs into his repertoire alongside his own compositions. He holds Rose's voice and distinctive style in the highest regard, considering him the vanguard of all musical shows. D'Silva asserts that the current generation of singers falls short of Rose's exceptional talent, emphasizing the unparalleled contributions Rose made to the music industry.[1]\n\nIn June 2015, a musical event took place at the Pai Tiatrist Hall, located in the Ravindra Bhavan in Margao. The event, meticulously arranged by D'Silva, showcased am ensemble of prominent artists from the Konkani stage. Notably, the performance featured the band Fantasy, with D'Silva himself demonstrating his mastery on the drums and lending his vocal talents to two songs. Adding to the allure of the event, emerging talents Sunaina, Aveena, and Cielda Pereira graced the stage, infusing the Goan music scene. Furthermore, the occasion served as a platform for D'Silva to anticipate the release of his highly anticipated Konkani audio album titled Silver, Golden Jubilee. The concert was a collaborative effort between the Department of Art and Culture and the Ravindra Bhavan committee.[2] Following the conclusion of the three-hour spectacle and the launch of his sixth CD, Best of Connie M, D'Silva made the decision to step away from regular performances, reserving his appearances for select and special occasions.[1]\n\nAwards[edit]\n\nD'Silva has been honored with the \"Goa State Cultural Award\" in the field of music for the year 2007-2008.[3] He was recognized for his lyrical composition in the tiatr performances Family Day and Kurl'leo, winning the \"Best Lyrics\" prize for his songs \"Osotori\"[4] and \"Moronn\" respectively.[5] Furthermore, D'Silva received a special acknowledgement from the Ravindra Bhavan, Margao for his significant contributions to the tiatr domain.[6]\n\nSelected stage works[edit]\nYear\tTitle\tRole\tNotes\tRef\n\tCatkar\tSinger\t\t[7]\n\tKuniad\tSinger\t\n1980s\tNichev\tCo-writer\t\t[7][8]\n\tDivorce\tDrummer\t\t[7]\n\tGoencho Saib\tActor\t\n\tTi Moji Maim\tActor\t\n\tRupnnem\tSinger\t\n2004\tDevak Zai Zalear\tSinger\t\t[9][7]\n2005\tRoddonaka\tActor\t\t[10][7]\n2009\tMahanand Monis Vo Soitan ?\tSinger\t\t[11][7]\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d e f g \"Well played 50!\".

The film is the first in the Mărgelatu series, a set of Western-inspired which center on the eponymous protagonist (Florin Piersic), a mysterious gunslinger who assists revolutionaries in 1840s Wallachia.[1] The cast also includes Marga Barbu, Ion Marinescu, Iurie Darie and Ernest Maftei.\n\nThe film focuses on a group of revolutionary boyars who come into possession of a treasure left behind by Tudor Vladimirescu. The boyars, with the help of Mărgelatu, transport the treasure, as well as a letter proving its authenticity, through Wallachia to hand the treasure and letter to an envoy named \"The Yellow Rose\" in order to purchase arms. Along the way, the boyars are pursued by the forces of the prince.\n\nProduction[edit]\n\nNovelist Eugen Barbu and Nicolae Paul Mihail wrote the film's script. Barbu had written six scripts for a previous series called Haiducii, one of which cowritten with Mihail. The success of Haiducii inspired Barbu and Mihail to collaborate on another series of six film, which became the Mărgelatu series. Doru Năstase was selected to direct the film due to the success of his historical drama Vlad Țepeș.[2] Indoor portions of the film were shot in the studios of the Bucharest Film Production Center.

He was noted for his strength, bravery, and desire for war.[3]\n\nBirth and Early Life[edit]\n\nHe was the son of Kauakahiakahoʻowaha, 18th Alii Aimoku of Oʻahu, and of his wife Mahulua.[2] He was their first-born and only son. If he had any siblings, they are now eclipsed and forgotten. Kūaliʻi was born at Kalapawai, on the land of Kailua, Koʻolaupoko district. The ceremony of cutting the navel-string was performed at the Heiau of Alala, and for that occasion, was brought the sacred drums of ʻOpuku and Hāwea. During his youth Kūaliʻi was brought up sometimes at Kailua, at other times at Kualoa. One of the special kāpūs attached to his childhood home of Kualoa, was whenever a chief resided there, all canoes, when passing by the land of Kualoa, on arriving at Makawai, should lower their masts and keep them down until they had passed the sea off Kualoa and got into that of Kaʻaʻawa. It is not certain of the underlying motive of this kapu and custom. It may have been a religious observance on account of the sacred character of the \"Pali o Kualoa,\" or a conventional mode of deference to the high chief residing there. It was strictly observed, however, and serious consequences would come to the infractor of the kāpū.[3]\n\nMystery Surrounding Kūaliʻi[edit]\n\nAs of today, only one legend of the acts of Kūaliʻi has been reduced to writing and preserved. There doubtless were at one time several other legends regarding a king so widely known, so thoroughly feared, and so intimately connected with the highest families on Maui, Molokaʻi, and Kauaʻi as was Kūaliʻi, and as was his hardly less illustrious son, Peleʻioholani. But the political destruction of the royal house of Kūaliʻi by Kahekili II of Maui, the spoliation of the territorial resources of its scions by the successful conquerors, and perhaps in no inconsiderable degree the idea set afloat by both the Maui and Hawaiʻi victors that the Kūaliʻi's were a doomed race. All these co-operative causes first rendered the recital of such legends treasonable, next unfashionable, and lastly forgotten. As a singular good fortune, yet, amidst the destruction of so much ancient lore that doubtless clustered round the names of Kūaliʻi and Peleʻioholani, several copies of the celebrated Mele or chant of Kūaliʻi have been preserved and reduced to writing; and Polynesian students are under great obligation to Mr. Curtis J. Lyons for his English translation of the same.[3]\n\nThe only significant subject remaining in the legends of Kūaliʻi appears to be rather a compilation of previous existing legends than an original one, and its compilation was probably as late as the latter part of the reign of Kamehameha I, when upwards of a century had elapsed since the death of Kūaliʻi, and time had covered the original historical data with its ivy of fable and myth. Subjecting this legend, however, to the same critical examination with which I have treated other legends; allowing for the exaggerations and embellishments incident to and unavoidable in a legend that is told by professional raconteurs to admiring audiences, and is orally handed down for several generations; and having compared it with other legends treating of Kūaliʻi's contemporaries, and with the chant just referred to, the conclusion is that the following data as probably historical facts.[3]\n\nReign[edit]\n\nKūaliʻi succeeded his father as the Mōʻī of Oʻahu, but by that time it would appear that the title had become more nominal than real, and that the ʻEwa and Waialua chiefs ruled their portions of the island with but little regard for the suzerainty of the King, who, since the time of Kānekapua-Kākuhihewa, resided primarily on their patrimonial domains in the Koʻolaupoko district.[1][3]\n\nReunification of Oʻahu[edit]\n\nKūaliʻi's first attempt to bring the Oʻahu chiefs to their proper status as feudatories of the Mōʻī of Oʻahu was directed against the chief of the Kona district. The legend gives the name of the principal chief in the Kona district on Oʻahu as Lonoʻikaika, but the name lacks correctness. The occasion of the collision was this: — In the valley of Waolani, a side valley from the great Nuʻuanu, stood one of the sacred heiau called Kawaluna, which only the highest chief of the island was entitled to consecrate at the yearly sacrifice. As Mōʻī of Oʻahu the undoubted right to perform the ritual was with Kūaliʻi, and he resolved to assert his privilege and try conclusions with the Kona chiefs, who were preparing to resist what they considered an assumption of authority by the Koʻolaupoko chief. Crossing the mountain by the Nuʻuanu and Kalihi passes, Kūaliʻi brought together his men on the ridge of Keanakamano, overlooking the Waolani valley, descended to the Heiau, performed the customary ceremony on such occasions, and at the conclusion fought and routed the Kona forces that had ascended the valley to resist and prevent him. The Kona chiefs submitted themselves, and Kūaliʻi returned to Kailua.[1][3]\n\nWe next hear of Kūaliʻi making an expedition to Kauaʻi for the purpose of procuring suitable wood from which to manufacture spears for his soldiers. Succeeding in this, and fully prepared, Kūaliʻi turned his attention to the ʻEwa and Waialua chiefs and their subjection to his authority. The two armies met on the land of Kalena and the plain of Heleauau, not far from Līhuʻe, where Kūaliʻi was victorious. The ʻEwa chiefs, however, made another effort to regain the upper hand, and fought a second battle with Kūaliʻi at Malamanui and Paupauwela, in which they were thoroughly defeated, and the authority of Kūaliʻi as Mōʻī of Oʻahu finally secured and acknowledged.[1][3]\n\nRaiding Hawaiʻi[edit]\n\nHaving thus subdued the great district chiefs of Oʻahu, it is related, and the Chant confirms the fact, that Kūaliʻi started with a well-equipped fleet to make war on the Big Island of Hawaiʻi. But, in reality, this was really only a well-organized raid on the coast of Hilo. These kinds of expeditions were not at all uncommon in those days, and undertaken as much for the purpose of keeping a chief’s warriors and fleet in practice and acquiring renown for himself. Kūaliʻi’s other goal was to obtain territorial additions to his kingdom. As this expedition took place in the earlier part of Kūaliʻi's life and reign, it probably occurred while Keākealaniwahine was still the Queen of Hawaiʻi, and before the accession of her son Keaweʻīkekahialiʻiokamoku.[1][3]\n\nLanding at Laupahoehoe, the subordinate chief there hastily assembled what force he could command to repel the invader. The name of this chief is given as Haʻalilo, but as this is the only time and the only legend that mentions him, it is unable to connect his name with any of the great Hawaiʻi families. In the battle that ensued this Haʻalilo was defeated, and Kūaliʻi having secured such plunder as usually fell to the victors on such excursions, was preparing to make his next descent on the Puna district, when news came to him from Oʻahu that the ʻEwa and Waiʻanae chiefs had revolted again. Hastily returning to Oʻahu, he met the hostile chiefs at Waiʻanae, and after a severe contest, routed them effectively with great slaughter near the watercourse of Kalapo and below Eleu.[1][3]\n\nHaving again crushed rebellion at home, it is said in the legend that Kūaliʻi made a second voyage to the Hilo district, but what he did or how he succeeded is not stated. On his return from Hilo, however, while recruiting his force at Kāʻanapali, Maui, he was met by a deputation from the Kona chiefs of Molokaʻi, invoking his assistance against the Koʻolau chiefs of that island, who had encroached upon the fishing-grounds of the former. The deputation consisted of a chief named Paepae and a chiefess named Kapolei, the daughter of Keopuolono. According to their request, Kūaliʻi crossed over to Molokaʻi and landed at Kaunakakai, where the Kona chiefs were assembled. After agreeing upon their operations, their forces and Kualiʻi's fleet rendezvoused at Moʻomomi on Kaluakoi, and from there made their descent on Kalaupapa, where the Koʻolau chiefs had collected. A well contested battle was fought, the Koʻolau chiefs were beaten, and having satisfactorily settled the conflicts of the Molokaʻi chiefs, Kūaliʻi returned to Oʻahu.[1][3]\n\nThe legend refers to an expedition that Kūaliʻi made to Lānaʻi, but the incidents related are so full of anachronisms, as to render the whole account unreliable. That Kūaliʻi made an armed excursion to Lānaʻi is quite probable, and in accordance with the spirit and customs of his age, but that the excursion was made as related in the legend is highly improbable.[3][1]\n\nSuccession to Kauaʻi[edit]\n\nBut what neither legend nor Mele refers to, however, is Kūaliʻi's connection with the Kauaʻi chiefs and his influence there. And yet it is incontestable, that during his own lifetime he had established his son Peleʻioholani as Mōʻī over at least the Kona section of Kauaʻi. Had this connection been the result of war and conquest, it is hardly probable that the legend and the chant would have both been silent about it. It arose then, probably, from a matrimonial connection of himself as well as of his son Peleʻioholani with Kauaʻi chiefesses, heiresses of the Kona districts.[3][1]\n\nNo legends that have state how it happened, but they all concur in representing Kūaliʻi of Oʻahu as the next chief over the windward side of Kauaʻi after the assassination of Kawelo-a-Maihunaliʻi, the former king. The historical probability is that Kūaliʻi reclaimed the succession to that portion of the island, as well as the sovereignty, in the name of his grandmother, Kawelolauhuki, one of the daughters of Kawelomahamahaia. It is also possible that the succession was because Kūaliʻi's predecessors struck a deal with Kaweloamaihunaliʻi of Kauaʻi, agreeing to cede Kauaʻi to Oʻahu in case both he and his enemy Kaweloʻaikanaka as result of the coming war, in order to obtain a handful of warriors and a double canoe, which Kaihikapu-a-Kakuhihewa gladly did.[3][1]\n\nHe had also been to Kauaʻi once as a young man to gather kauila wood for the weapons he needed for his warriors. He also made a war club of kauila, which he called Huli-moku-alana (Victorious land turning). The legends of Kūaliʻi never speak of Kauaʻi as a conquered country. The belief is that he came into possession by inheritance, as understood in those days. He installed his son Peleʻioholani as governor in his stead, reporting to Kūaliʻi himself.[3][1]\n\nFrom this time forward, to the arrival of Captain Cook in 1778, a mist has fallen over the history of Kauaʻi, its legends and traditions, through which are but indistinctly seen the outlines of some of her prominent men. Kūaliʻi is called the Mōʻī of Kauaʻi, but, except on occasional visits, does not seem to have resided there, preferring Oʻahu and his paternal estates. He accessed Kauaʻi for its ability to produce raw material and men for his army. But when he grew old he placed his son, Peleʻioholani, as his viceroy over Kauaʻi, and the latter resided there for many years; yet of his administration and exploits while thus governing Kauaʻi not a whisper has come down to break the silence brooding over Kauaʻi history.[3][1]\n\nMarriage[edit]\n\nOf Kūaliʻi's wives only one is known by name, Kalanikahimakeialiʻi, a Maui chiefess, whose mother was Kalaniomaiheuila, a daughter of Lonohonuakini, king of Maui. His wife thus was the daughter of Kalaniomaiheuila and her brother Kaulahea II, king of Maui, and thus a chiefess of the highest rank, an Aliʻi Piʻo. Other legends speak of the large family of Kūaliʻi, but without mentioning his wives or their descents. It may fairly be assumed, therefore, that his relations with Kauaʻi originated from such a cause. Three children were born from this union, two sons, Kapiʻiohoʻokalani and Peleʻioholani, and one daughter, Kukuiaimakalani. (Kukuimakalani); also it is mentioned that he had a daughter named Kapionuilanilalahai, the mother of Kahahana, last Mōʻī of Oʻahu.[3][1]\n\nKūaliʻi is said to have lived to an extremely old age, and to have possessed unusual strength and vigor to the last. It is related that when Kūaliʻi was upwards of ninety years old, Peleʻioholani arrived one time from Kauaʻi on a visit to his father on Oʻahu. Without endorsing the details of the legend, it suffices to say that a quarrel arose between father and son, that the latter assaulted the former, and a scuffle ensued, in which the old man, getting the grip of the “lua’’ on his son, punished him so severely that, when released from the paternal grasp, he started at once for Kauaʻi, and never revisited Oʻahu until after his father's death.[3][1]\n\nDeath[edit]\n\nKailua, in Koʻolaupoko, seems to have been the favorite residence of Kūaliʻi, and there he died at a very advanced age. Kūaliʻi had lived to an extremely old age-\"until he was bent and feeble, with eyes drooped and bleary, with skin like a dried hala leaf, and was bound up in netting as though he had been made an ancestral god.\" He was reported to have been carried into his last battle in a hammock slung from the shoulders of two warriors. Kamakau reports he died in 1730 at the age of 175. His longevity may be debated since the average Hawaiian had a much shorter life span. Some historians speculate Hawaiian lived to 30 or 40 years of age, which probably compares favorably with Europeans at the time. Because of their special diets, nurturing and genetic inheritance, aliʻi like Kūaliʻi may have enjoyed longer life spans.[3][1]\n\nShortly before his death he called his trustiest Kahu and friend to his side and strictly enjoined upon him the duty of hiding his bones after death, so that mortal man should never get access to them or be able to desecrate them. When Kūaliʻi was dead, and the body, according to custom, had been dissected and the flesh burned, the Kahu carefully wrapped the bones up in a bundle and started off, as everybody thought, to hide them in some cave or sink them in the ocean. Instead of which, he repaired to a lonely spot and there pounded up the bones of the dead king into the finest kind of powder. Secreting this about his person, the Kahu returned to court and ordered a grand feast to be held in commemoration of the deceased. Immense preparations were made, and the chiefs from far and near were invited to attend. The night before the feast the Kahu quietly and unobserved mixed the powdered bones of the dead king in the poi prepared for the morning's feast. At the close of the meal the following day the Kahu was asked by the chiefs present if he had faithfully executed the wishes of the late king regarding his bones. With conscious pride at his successful device, the Kahu pointed to the stomachs of the assembled company and replied that he had hidden his master's bones in a hundred living tombs. The legend does not say how the guests liked their repast, but the Kahu was greatly applauded. When Kūaliʻi died he was followed as Mōʻī of Oʻahu by his son Kapiʻiohookalani, and his other son. Peleʻioholani, succeeded him as sovereign over that portion of Kauaʻi which in some now forgotten manner had come under the sway of Kūaliʻi. The throne of Oʻahu would not outlive that of his grandchildren. Three of his grandchildren: Kanahāʻokalani, Kūmahana, and Kahahana would rule separately as the 21st, 23rd and 24th Mōʻī of Oʻahu.[3][1]\n\nSong of Kūaliʻi[edit]\n\nThe chant of Kūaliʻi was composed by Kumahukia and Heʻea about 1700 to celebrate the royal conqueror of Oʻahu. It opens with an obscure allusion to the fishing up by Maui from the hill Kauwiki, of Hawaiʻi, out of the bottom of the sea, and the fetching of the gods Kāne and Kanaloa, Kauakahi and Maliu to these islands. The chant was translated by Hon. Lorrin Andrews and Curtis J. Lyons and recorded by historian, Samuel M. Kamakau.[1][4][3]\n\nReferences[edit]\nAbraham Fornander, Fornander Collection of Hawaiian Antiquities and Folk-Lore [1]\nRay K.

Despite some dialectical variations, it became imperative for the fewer colonizers to learn it for territorial conquest. The earliest records of the language date back to the 1510s, but a substantial record was only produced in the 1540s. Jesuits played a crucial role in formalizing its grammar, with Joseph of Anchieta composing a grammar for it in 1555. Through miscegenation, Old Tupi permeated Brazilian society to the extent that even the children of Portuguese spoke it natively. Over time, it gave rise to lingua francas and contributed various words and a distinctive literature to Brazilian Portuguese and its society.\n\nBeginning of colonization[edit]\n\nIn the 16th century, although hundreds of indigenous languages were spoken in the territory that would later become Brazil, in its coastal region and nearby areas practically the same indigenous language was spoken. This was observed early in colonization, despite the existence of some dialectal variations. According to Pero de Magalhães Gândavo [pt], \"The language used along the entire coast is one, although in certain words it may differ in some parts, but not in a way that they cannot understand each other.\" The Portuguese referred to this language as the \"Brasílica language\"; nowadays, it is known as Old Tupi.[note 1] It was the language that colonizers learned and spoke for a long time, in order to be able to colonize the territory, as their population was much smaller than the indigenous one.[2] Eduardo de Almeida Navarro argues Old Tupi can, therefore, be considered a classical indigenous language.[3]\n\nFirst folio of the oldest substantial record of Old Tupi\n\nAccounts of the discovery of Brazil, from the voyage of Pedro Álvares Cabral in 1500, do not include records of Old Tupi.[4][5] Some terms of Tupi origin can be found in early Portuguese navigation documents,[4] such as those of the ship Bretoa in 1511, which mention various çagoys or çagoyns (Callitrichidae).[6] The first attempt to compile a list of terms from this language occurred during the circumnavigation voyage of Ferdinand Magellan in 1519;[4][7] collected in Guanabara Bay by Antonio Pigafetta, the five or six recorded words refer to items that Tupinambás traded with Europeans.[8] The oldest substantial record of Old Tupi was produced in the 1540s by a Frenchman named Jehan Lamy.[9] It was also collected in Guanabara Bay[10] and contains 88 entries,[10] although some are repeated.[11] The existence of a main language spoken along the coast made it worthwhile to master it.[12]\n\nInfluence in colonial Brazil[edit]\n\nIn English colonies, settler colonialism was practiced, with entire families migrating, maintaining social and ethnic segregation from the indigenous inhabitants of such locations. In Brazil, however, what occurred was exploitation colonialism. Entire families did not come, but rather men of low social status, exiles, and adventurers, who had to learn the language of the indigenous people in order to be able to deal with them. These men also formed mixed-race families.[13] In 1546, John III sent to Brazil six Jesuits, including João de Azpilcueta Navarro [pt], the first to learn Old Tupi, alongside the first governor-general of the country, Tomé de Sousa. With the second governor-general, Duarte da Costa [pt], came Joseph of Anchieta, responsible for writing the first grammar of the language [pt] in 1555, which would only be published 40 years later.[note 2] To convert the indigenous people, settlements were established, grouping together natives of different nations, protecting them from slavery. To catechize them, a parallel mythology was created, seeking analogies between Portuguese and Old Tupi.[15]\n\nLingua francas[edit]\nMain article: Língua Geral\n\nOver time, lingua francas emerged, being widely spoken in colonial Brazil, on its streets and in homes, even those of the nobility. According to Antônio Vieira, the children of the Portuguese learned the Portuguese language only at school. At least three lingua francas existed, with two being the most prominent, namely, the Southern General Language and the Amazonian General Language.[16][note 3]\n\nLegacy[edit]\n\nOld Tupi is the only indigenous language with a significant presence in the lexicon of the Portuguese spoken in Brazil, as well as in its toponymy and anthroponymy. It also left a legacy in Brazilian literature, such as the lyrical and theatrical poetry of Joseph of Anchieta and the letters of the Camarão Indians.[2]\n\nNotes[edit]\n^ It is not known by what name native speakers called it.[1]\n^ Luís Figueira [pt] also published a grammar circa 1628.[14][2]\n^ A third was the General Language of Bahia.[17]\nReferences[edit]\n^ Navarro 2005, p. 11.\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c Navarro & Tessuto Júnior 2016, p. 26.\n^ Navarro & Tessuto Júnior 2016, pp. 25–26.\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c Dalby & Hair 1966, p. 44.\n^ Rodrigues 2000, p. 542.\n^ Garcia 1942, p. 166.\n^ Rodrigues 2000, p. 545.\n^ Rodrigues 2000, pp. 545–546.\n^ Dalby & Hair 1966, p. 42.\n^ \nJump up to:\na b Rodrigues 2000, p. 546.\n^ Dalby & Hair 1966, pp. 57–58.\n^ Dalby & Hair 1966, p. 65.\n^ Navarro & Tessuto Júnior 2016, p. 27.\n^ Magalhães 2011, pp. 380–385.\n^ Navarro & Tessuto Júnior 2016, pp. 27–28.\n^ Navarro & Tessuto Júnior 2016, pp. 28–29.\n^ Navarro & Tessuto Júnior 2016, p. 29.\nBibliography[edit]\nDalby, David; Hair, P.

In 2008, he made his debut as a writer with the script adaptation of the film Love is Beautiful [Ko].[3]\n\nIn 2009, Kim co-wrote and co-directed Kwak Kyung-taek's drama Friend, Our Legend. It is a remake / TV adaptation of Kwak Kyung-taek's own 2001 box-office hit film Friend.[2][3]\n\nIn 2013, Kim made his debut as a television writer with the MBC drama The Queen's Classroom, which was an adaptation of a Japanese drama with the same name. It revolves around Ma Yeo-jin (played by Go Hyun-jung), a stern teacher who becomes the homeroom teacher of an elementary school class. The drama gained attention for its distinctive storyline, which places the children in difficult situations, forcing them to confront reality. It portrays the children's journey of personal growth and self-discovery as they navigate through a harsh teaching method that involves harsh words and extreme circumstances. Even after Ma Yeo-jin's departure, the students continue to reflect on her teachings and apply them, solidifying her status as a guiding hero for the children.[3]\n\nKim Won-seok collaborated with writer Kim Eun-sook on the 2016 KBS2 drama Descendants of the Sun, which was based on Kim Won-seok's award-winning work Doctors Without Borders. The drama, set in an unfamiliar and challenging environment, depicted the struggles of young soldiers and doctors. While the romantic relationships in the series were captivating, the story also emphasized the sense of duty displayed by the main characters, portraying them as genuine heroes. Descendants of the Sun became a sensation in South Korea and China, attracting a wide audience due to its compelling storyline and exploration of life's value.[4][5]\n\nA year later, Kim returned with his new drama Man to Man, which made history as the first South Korean television series to be simulcast on both television and Netflix.[6] Man to Man tells the story of a mysterious agent who becomes a bodyguard for a famous Korean star and deals with secretive people around him. The drama presents the thrilling adventures of these secret agents in different exciting ways.[3] The action scenes in the show are choreographed by Park Jung-ryul, who is well-known for his work on the movie The Man from Nowhere. The project is led by director Lee Chang-min. First script reading took place on October 3, 2016.[7] Filming began on October 17, 2016 and ended on March 6, 2017,[8] taking place in Seoul, South Korea and Budapest, Hungary.[9]\n\nNotably, the first episode featured a parody of a famous scene from Descendants of the Sun, and two actors from the drama, David Lee McInnis and Song Joong-ki, made cameo appearances.[9] Director Kwak Kyung-taek also made cameo appearance.[2] Director Lee Chang-min, known for shows like Birth of a Beauty and Remember: War of the Son, had actors Lee Si-eon and Namkoong Min, who respectively acted in those dramas, make cameos in Man to Man as well.[10]\n\nKim took a hiatus for several years before returning in 2023 with Payback, a revenge drama that revolves around the characters Eun-yong (played by Lee Sun-kyun), a skilled financial merchant, and Jun-kyung (Moon Chae-won), a legal expert. Together, they confront a formidable cartel. The drama has achieved a noteworthy viewership rating of approximately 10%.[11]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nFilm[edit]\nDirecting and scriptwriting credits for film\nYear\tTitle\tDirector\tCredited as\tRef.\nEnglish\tKorean\tDirecting Staff\tScreenwriter\n1999\tDr. K\t닥터 K\tKwak Kyung-taek\tDirecting department staff\t—\t[2]\n2000\tDie Bad\t죽거나 혹은 나쁘거나\tRyoo Seung-wan\tAssistant director\tRyoo Seung-wan\t[12]\n2006\tThe City of Violence\t짝패\t[13]\n2008\tLove is Beautiful\t대한이, 민국씨\tChoi Jin-won [Ko]\t—\tAdaptation team[A]\t[3][14]\nTelevision series[edit]\nDirecting and scriptwriting credits for television series\nYear\tTitle\tNetwork\tCredited as\tRef.\nEnglish\tKorean\tOriginal author\tScriptwriter\tDirector\n2009\tFriend, Our Legend\t친구, 우리들의 전설\tMBC\tKwak Kyung-taek\tCo-author[B]\tCo-directed[C]\t[15]\n2013\tThe Queen's Classroom\t여왕의 교실\tKazuhiko Yukawa\tKim Won-seok\tLee Dong-yoon [Ko]\t[16]\n2016\tDescendants of the Sun\t태양의 후예\tKBS2\tKim Won-seok\tCo-author[D]\tLee Eung-bok [Ko]\nBaek Sang-hoon [Ko]\t[17]\n2017\tMan to Man\t맨투맨\tJTBC\t—\tKim Won-seok\tLee Chang-min\t[18]\n2023\tPayback\t법쩐\tSBS\tLee Won-tae\t[19]\nAccolades[edit]\nAwards and nominations[edit]\nName of the award ceremony, year presented, category, nominee of the award, and the result of the nomination\nAward ceremony\tYear\tCategory\tNominee / Work\tResult\tRef.\n52nd Baeksang Arts Awards\t2016\tGrand Prize (TV)\tDescendants of the Sun\tWon\t[20][21]\nBest Drama\tNominated\nBest Scriptwriter (TV)\tDescendants of the Sun[D]\tNominated\n43rd Korean Broadcasting Grand Prize\tBest Drama\tDescendants of the Sun\tWon\t[22]\n11th Seoul International Drama Awards\tExcellent Korean Drama\tWon\t[23]\n5th APAN Star Awards\tDrama of the Year\tWon\t[24][25]\n9th Korea Drama Awards\tBest Drama\tWon\t[26]\nBest Drama Writer\tDescendants of the Sun[D]\tNominated\nKorean Advertisers Association Awards\tBest Drama\tDescendants of the Sun\tWon\t[27]\n21st Asian Television Awards\tBest Drama Series\tWon\t[28]\n30th KBS Drama Awards\tBest Screenwriter\tDescendants of the Sun[D]\tWon\t[29]\nKorea Communications Commission Broadcasting Awards\t2017\tGrand Prize for Excellence in Production\tDescendants of the Sun\tWon\t[30]\n50th WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival\tSpecial Jury Award (TV series)\tWon\t[31]\nState honors[edit]\nName of country, year given, and name of honor\nCountry\tAward Ceremony\tYear\tHonor\tRef.\nSouth Korea\tKorean Content Story Awards[E]\t2011\tKorea Creative Content Agency's Director Excellence Award\nfor Doctors Without Borders\t[32]\n2023\tMinister of Culture, Sports and Tourism Award\n15th Korean Content Story Awards\nfor Doctors Without Borders,\nthe original work of the drama Descendants of the Sun\t[33]\nNotes[edit]\n^ Under team lead by Choi Jin-won [Ko]\n^ Co-author with Kwak Kyung-taek\n^ Co-directed with Kwak Kyung-taek\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d Co-authored together by Kim Eun-sook and Kim Won-seok, every award and nomination is shared\n^ Honors are awarded at the 'Korea Content Awards - Story Category', which was established under the name of the 'Korea Story Contest' in 2009.

{"date": "2024-01-03-18-29", "error": false, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Forshee", "text_blocks": "Jon Forshee is an American composer, teacher, writer, editor, curator, and performer\n\nCompositions[edit]\n\nForshee’s compositions are for acoustic instruments (solo, chamber, and orchestral), voice, computer and electronic sound, as well as audio-visual media, a chamber opera, and a semi-improvised outdoor site-specific work.[1]\n\nIn his music for computer sound together with acoustic instruments, “Forshee… expands and extends the instrument’s original quality through the use of electronics.”[2], a process that can take on mythical overtones as in his Transfigured Verse, in which the electronically extended sound of the harp depicts “Amphion who plays his harp to move stones into place and raise the Seven Gates of Thebes. The harp [in Forshee’s Transfigured Verse] is the builder and healer and answered in a magical kaleidoscope of computer-generated sound”. [3]\n\nPaul Muller interprets Forshee's Transfigured Verse as an allegory for the Old Testament story of David who arrives with lyre in hand with which he pleases Saul who takes him into royal service:\n\nThe playing starts out slow but the tension gradually increases as the harp and electronics contrast, perhaps recreating the mental distress that Saul may have felt. The electronics drone along in the background, never dominating, but delivering a relentless sense of oppression. The harp notes and chords gradually become more active, generating a restorative vigor that infuses the overall sound. Towards the finish the tempo slows and the harp notes are spaced out between silences and scattered electronic blips. The final feeling is one of relief so that Transfigured Verse softly and artfully brings out the healing powers of the harp.[4]\n\nForshee’s compositions have been performed by such musicians as Brad Lubman, the Callithumpian Consort, Colin McAllister, Tasha Smith Godinez, and Trio Kobayashi, at such venues as The Stone (NYC), Maverick Concert Hall (Woodstock, NY), and the Austrian Cultural Forum New York. Recordings of Forshee’s music appear on the Open Space and Centaur Records.\n\nWriting and Editing[edit]\n\nForshee’s publications have focused on music, ideas, and technology of Benjamin Boretz, J.K. Randall, Robert Morris, Roger Reynolds, and Trevor Wishart, specifically Wishart’s Soundloom interface, which allows the user to run C-programs for transforming sounds from a graphic interface written in TK/Tcl, hiding the mechanics of the process.[5]\n\nForshee’s writings appear in Perspectives of New Music, the Computer Music Journal, and Open Space. He is also an editor of Open Space and a founding editor of the online journal First: Listen (The Journal of Critical Listening through Music).\n\nCareer[edit]\n\nForshee has taught music composition, theory, and other music subjects at University of California, San Diego and University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, including its Summer Institute for Contemporary Performance Practice (SICPP).\n\nEducation[edit]\n\nForshee graduated from Interlochen Center for the Arts and Bowling Green State University and then obtained a masters degree at the Eastman School of Music where he studied with Allan Schindler, Ricardo Zohn-Muldoon , and Robert Morris. He continued his studies at University of California, San Diego, principally with Rand Steiger and Anthony Davis, earning a Ph.D. (2017). Prior to that (in 2005) Forshee also attended courses at the Center for the Composition of Music Iannis Xenakis (CCMIX), in Paris, France.\n\nForshee also studied privately with George Rochberg. And his reflections on this experience significantly help flesh out contemporary understanding of Rochberg's distinctive poetics and pedagogy. Forshee remarks (as quoted by Amy Wlodarski) that \"Rochberg’s personal advice and feedback have all become a part of my musical world and creative thinking\". In particular Rochberg's emphasis on serving musicians by composing parts that are 'playable', and his dedication to individualism and freedom have been adopted by Forshee as a shared concern.[6]\n\nSelected works[edit]\nApokatastis (2021) – chamber ensemble with computer-generated sounds\nAnti-Borderlands (2020) – Field orchestra\nTransfigured Verse (2020) – harp and computer-generated sounds\nOpus (2016) – contrabass solo\nSextet (2013) – bassoon, percussion, harp, harpsichord, ‘cello, bass\nDesiderata (2012) – horn, trombone, tuba\nAscensions (2012) – Hutchins Consort\nGig of Gists (2008) – solo piano\nSelected Publications[edit]\n\"Speaking of Listening, Speaking of Seeing: Group Variations II by Benjamin A.

In 1873, at the age of 17, he immigrated to Eretz Yisroel[2] and served as one of the heads of the Hungarian Kollel for 23 years,[3] along with Rabbi Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld and Rabbi Moshe Nachman Wallenstein.[4] After Shneur Zalman Fradkin immigrated to Jerusalem, Goldberger eagerly studied at his beit midrash. Fradkin established Badatz Kollel Hasidim in Jerusalem, and Goldberger was sobsequently appointed Dayan of its Beit din. He served on the court alongside Lipman David Shubkes [he] and Yosef Yehuda Strasberg [he]. After Fradkin's death in 1902, Goldberger was replaced by Avraham HaCohen, because Goldberger was a Litvak. He published the book Torat Chessed on himself and Fradkin's writings following the death of his son, threatening Hasidim with the possibility of permanently losing many of his writings.[5]\n\nHe died on Friday, December 30, 1910 in Jerusalem, and was buried there. The newspaper HaZvi reported:\n\n\"Friday 29 Kislev was a day of mourning for many members of the Jewish community in Jerusalem because one of the elders of the distinguished community, Rabbi Tuvia Goldberger, passed away. He was for many years the director of Kollel Ungaria, excellent in good measures. And he was there night and day in Torah and Talmud. A funeral was declared on behalf of the Rabbinate and a very large crowd came to pay their last respects to him, and eulogizers properly eulogized him.

Due to disagreement about the research proposal, the Speaker of the House of Representatives Vera Bergkamp decided to postpone the inquiry. A motion by PVV parliamentary leader Geert Wilders after the House of Representatives elections of 22 November 2023 to continue the inquiry was unanimously adopted.\n\nTemporary committee[edit]\n\nA temporary committee had been established to prepare for the inquiry, most importantly a research proposal. At the start on 6 July 2022, this consisted of the members:[1]\n\nKhadija Arib (chair, PvdA)\nUlysse Ellian (vice-chair, VVD)\nPieter Omtzigt (Independent)\nWybren van Haga (Group Van Haga)\nVicky Maeijer (PVV)\nHilde Palland (CDA)\nPepijn van Houwelingen (FVD)\nNicki Pouw-Verweij (JA21)\nMarijke van Beukering-Huijbregts (D66)\nLiane den Haan (Independent)\n\nAfter the start of the committee, the Presidium of the House of Representatives received reports about inappropriate behavior by Arib when she was Speaker of the House of Representatives. The immediate reason for the reports was the fact that Arib, as committee chairman, directed the civil servants of the committees. When these reports came out in September 2022 and an investigation was announced, the committee's civil servants unanimously indicated that they were happy to work with Arib.[2] However, Arib felt so damaged by the reports and the announced investigation that she decided to leave the House and thus the committee.[3] As committee chair, she was succeeded by vice-chair Mariëlle Paul, who after a few months had replaced party colleague Ellian as committee member and vice-chair.\n\nVan Houwelingen and Van Haga's membership of the committee was controversial from the start, because they regularly spread conspiracy theories about corona and corona vaccines. The committee mutually agreed to be cautious in expressing party political positions regarding corona. At the end of September there was a fuss because Van Houwelingen had edited and posted a photo in which it appeared as if Minister of Health Ernst Kuipers was raising a Nazi flag. Van Houwelingen also continued to speak out about corona in various programs. Van Haga also took part in a debate about corona in February 2023, against the agreements. Part of the committee indicated anonymously in the NRC that it therefore intended to ask Van Haga and Van Houwelingen to resign from the committee.[4] Another part of the committee was surprised by that intention and frustrated about the leak.[5] After the subsequent committee meeting, no one left the committee.\n\nThe research proposal was sent to Parliament on 25 May 2023. Under that proposal, the inquiry would last until 2026. Only four parties registered for the inquiry; PVV, FVD, Group van Haga and Independent Den Haan. VVD, D66, CDA and GroenLinks wanted to wait for the Dutch Safety Boards third report before deciding whether they wanted to delegate MPs. GroenLinks also indicated that the question was too one-sided, namely focusing on whether too many measures had been taken. Because this was not the intended broad composition, Speaker of the House of Representatives Vera Bergkamp decided in June 2023 to postpone the inquiry.[6] A motion by Van Haga in September 2023 to start the inquiry as soon as possible was rejected by a wide majority.[7]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"Kamer installeert Tijdelijke commissie Corona\". tweedekamer.nl (in Dutch). 28 June 2023.

{"date": "2024-01-03-18-29", "error": false, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas_in_Lebanon", "text_blocks": "Osama Hamdan, the top representative of Hamas in Lebanon\n\nThe Hamas organization has a permanent and established presence in Lebanon. Hamas’s establishment in Lebanon is often referred to as “Hamasland”.[1][2] Term that emerged in a political discourse referring to the potential influence or control of the Palestinian Islamist movement, Hamas, in southern Lebanon. This concept gained prominence following the announcement of the formation of the Al-Aqsa Flood Vanguards unit by Hamas in Beirut.[3] The term draws a parallel to the historical \"Fatahland\" and according to Free Patriotic Movement (FPM) Leader Gebran Bassil, Hamas’s establishment in Lebanon raised concerns about Lebanon's sovereignty and stability.[4][5][6]\n\nAs part of Israel's efforts to target senior Hamas officials, on January 2, 2024, a significant airstrike in the Dahieh neighborhood of Beirut, Lebanon, led to the assassination of Saleh al-Arouri, the deputy leader of Hamas's political bureau. Al-Arouri was notably one of the key figures behind the October 7 attack on Israel. The strike also resulted in the deaths of three other individuals, including high-ranking Hamas militants Samir Findi Abu Amer and Azzam Al-Aqraa Abu Ammar.[7]\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nThe relationship between Hamas and Hezbollah has developed over the years according to “Lorient Today”.  Due to a mutual quest to undermine the PLO following their collaboration with Israel, the two organizations were closely aligned in certain periods.\n\nTheir relationship deteriorated following Hamas’s political alliance with Turkey, a country Iran, Hezbollah’s supporter, has had disagreements with. Their relationship worsened in 2011, during the Syrian uprising, when Hamas supported the rebels against the government. Hezbollah was fighting with the Syrian government against the Syrian rebels which included Hamas operatives present in Syria.[8]\n\nHamas and Hezbollah’s relationship started to improve in more recent years following the improving bond between Iran and Turkey. Hamas has had operatives over the years in Lebanon refugee camps, the improvement in Hamas-Hezbollah-Iran relationship led to an increase in Hamas presence and power in Lebanon, reported not only as political but as military support. \n\nJeroen Gunning, a professor of middle eastern studies at Kings College in London, explained that historically, during the British administration between 1920-1948, the South Lebanon community and the Northern community (Israel today) were intertwined. Following The Israel Independence war in 1948, Palestinians fled to Lebanon establishing several refugee camps in Lebanon. In 1969, the Lebanese state granted the camps independence to manage their own security.[8]\n\nHistorically, Hezbollah's involvement in Lebanese politics was limited to parliamentary activities. However, the Withdrawal of Israel from Lebanon in 2000 and Syria's departure in 2005, altering the political and military landscape on both regional and domestic fronts. In response, Hezbollah enhanced its involvement in Lebanese politics, officially joining the Lebanese government in 2005. While Israel's withdrawal in 2000 was hailed as the conclusive triumph for the Resistance in Lebanon, A significant challenge emerged concerning Hezbollah's disarmament, leading the movement to vehemently oppose it and even resort to force in May 2008, pushing the nation to the brink of internal conflict.[9]\n\nIn recent years, various Arab and international parties have passed numerous resolutions and agreements to address the stability and security of the volatile Lebanese region.[10]\n\nIn 2004, the UN Security Council Resolution 1559 was passed, ordering all armed militants to be disarmed of their weaponry. This is in order to allow the Lebanese state to assert its sovereignty.\n\nIn 2006, another resolution was passed by the UN Security Council, in the wake of the Israel-Lebanon war. The 1701 resolution orders Hezbollah and Israel to cease fire and all attacks and operations.[10]\n\nAccording to US State Department spokeswoman and several other sources, Hezbollah violated the UN resolution on various occasions. Over the past years Hezbollah has been reported to getting arms from iran and building bases for the production of independent arms within Lebanon.[11][12][10]\n\nThe Time of Israel explains the previous agreement that the Lebanese army refrains from intervening in these camps, left them vulnerable to the control of Palestinian parties, including Hamas.[1][13]\n\nIn 2017, Yahya Sinwar took over as Hamas leader in Gaza. Sinwar, having close relations with Iran according to New Lines Magazine, repaired Hamas’s relationship with the Lebanese organization Hezbollah and with Syria's President Bashar al-Assad. The restored relationship united the organization into an unofficial “unity of battlefields”, according to the New Lines Magazine.[13]\n\nIn 2020, Hamas’ leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was reported visiting Lebanon’s Palestinian refugee camps.[13]\n\nIn 2022 Sinwar revealed a treaty between “the resistance axis” (Lebanese, Palastenian, Syrian, and Iran). Analysts suspect a joint security room exists in Lebanon.[8] Despite the organizations cooperation, according to Ahmed Abdul-Hadi, the head of Hamas’s political bureau in Beirut, Hamas did not inform Hezbollah before their attack on 7 October 2023 In Israel.[8][6]\n\nConcerns have been raised by the previous Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, regarding Hezbollah’s relationship with Hamas. In a letter he wrote in May 2018 he warned regarding the strengthening relationship between Hamas and Hezbollah, referring to them as “the two internationally recognized terrorist organizations.. the Iranian proxy”. He refers to a previous letter he sent in 2017, where he informed the UN that Hamas has been conspiring with Hezbollah and its Teheran Sponsor in purpose to expand its activities beyond the Gaza boarders.  According to Danon, the cooperation between Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran is an international threat.[1]\n\nHamas 2023 declaration[edit]\n\nOn December 4 2023, in the midst of the 2023 Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza, Hamas announced the organization's official establishment in Lebanon. The Lebanon based unit was named the “al-Aqsa Flood Vanguards unit”.[14][15][16]\n\nHamas’s announcement called the “Palestinian people” of Lebanon and all Jihad fighters to join the organization and contribute to the resistance against the occupation, framing it as part of the broader struggle for the liberation of Jerusalem and the Al-Aqsa Mosque.[16]\n\nAccording to a US official reported on Sky News, Hezbollah had supplied Hamas members in Lebanon with rockets to use against Israel.[1]\n\nResponse[edit]\n\nThe establishment of the Vanguards of the Al-Aqsa Flood faced severe criticism from various political figures and factions within Lebanon. Many argued that such an organization, with potential military implications, could infringe upon Lebanon's sovereignty and violate international resolutions, particularly the Taif Agreement. Critics, including members of the Christian Lebanese Forces Party and other political figures, voiced concerns about a potential recurrence of historical issues related to armed Palestinian factions operating from Lebanese territory.\n\nIn response to the widespread criticism, Hamas' representative in Lebanon, Ahmad Abd Al-Hadi, attempted to ease concerns by stating that the organization would not have a military character. However, conflicting statements from other Hamas sources indicated that some members might be involved in armed resistance.\n\nLebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati firmly rejected the establishment of the new organization, emphasizing that it was inconceivable, and stressed that relevant elements had clarified it was not intended for military action.[16]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d \"With support of Iran and Hezbollah, experts believe Hamas well established in Lebanon\".\n^ \"Christians oppose Hamas recruitment in Lebanese refugee camps\". www.janglo.net.

(January 2024)\nBattle of Thane\nDate\t636 - 637 CE\nLocation\t\nThane, India\n\nResult\tChalukya victory[1]\nBelligerents\nChalukya Dynasty\tRashidun Caliphate\nCommanders and leaders\nPulakeshin II\t\n\nUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb\n\nUthman ibn Abi al-As\n\nStrength\nUnknown\tUnknown\nCasualties and losses\nUnknown\tUnknown\n\nThe Battle of Thane, a pivotal moment in history, saw the Arab invasion of Sindh following setbacks in naval expeditions against Thana and Broach. Led by Mughairah, the Arab forces faced defeat in Debal, prompting Caliph Umar to send a land army against Makran. Despite advice to cease operations in Hind (India), both Umar and his successor, Caliph Usman, refrained from further military actions in the region. This decision marked a crucial turning point in Arab interactions with the Indian subcontinent.[2]\n\nBackground[edit]\n\nThe backdrop of the Battle of Thane is rooted in the early Arab raids targeting the coastal regions of India. Originating from their secure base in Oman, the Arabs launched expeditions, with one directed towards Tanah (Thana), located near Bombay, around 15 A.H. (A.D. 637). Simultaneously, similar campaigns were undertaken against Barwas (Broach) and the Gulf of Ad-Daibul, specifically at Debal. Historical records, such as those by Al-Baladhuri, highlight a Muslim victory at Debal, but remain silent on the outcomes of the other two raids. Contrarily, the Chach-nama recounts a different narrative, stating that the Muslims suffered defeat, and their leader was killed by the governor of Chach in the Battle of Debal. This period of early Arab incursions and their varying degrees of success laid the groundwork for the subsequent military actions, including the Battle of Thane, and influenced the evolving dynamics of Arab interactions with the Indian subcontinent.[3]\n\nBattle[edit]\n\nIn 636 CE, during the expansionist era of the second Caliph, Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, the initial Arab Caliphatic invasion of India unfolded through a maritime expedition aimed at conquering Thana, near modern-day Mumbai. Umar, driven by a zealous mission to propagate Islam globally, assigned Usman from the Sakif tribe to seize control of Bahrayn and Oman. Usman, in turn, dispatched his brother Hakam to Bahrayn while personally advancing to Oman.\n\nWhile situated in Oman, Usman orchestrated a naval campaign to capture Thana along the western coast of India. However, the Imperial Chalukyan Navy, led by Pulakeshin II, successfully thwarted the Arab-Islamic naval expedition. The first-ever Arab-Islamic raid on India met with resounding defeat as they were repulsed, compelling their retreat back to Oman.[4][5][6]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ Chopra, Pran Nath (1992).

The production of non-traditional crops for the production of innovative products such as: preparations based on amaranth, xoconostle and maguey honey.[23]\n\nHidalgo is the first place in the country in the production of grain barley, coriander seed, pulquero maguey, lion's hand and forage turnip;[21] in second place of national production are green alfalfa, alstroemeria (coarse), peas, pomegranate, cloud and Zempoaxochitl.[22] In third place: canola, green fodder barley, green beans and figs; in fourth place nationally: olives, oats, grain oats, sugar cane other uses, peas, cauliflower, beans and prickly pears; and finally in fifth place: artichoke, raspberry and radish.[22]\n\nOn the other hand, the production of the production chain prickly pear-prickly pear, the production chain apple, the citrus production chain and the coffee production chain stand out for their importance.[22]\n\nCorn field in Mixquiahuala de Juárez.\nRanching[edit]\nLivestock exhibition in Pachuca de Soto.\n\nThe volume of livestock production during the year 2013 was 545,000 of which 109,732 tons was carcass meat, highlighting the production of sheep. The value of livestock production amounted to 8,015 million pesos. The value of livestock production amounted to 8015 million pesos. Its main products are classified into three categories: meat in channel with a share of 20.6%, milk 78.0% and other products 1.4%.\n\nIn turn, those that stood out the most were milk from bovine with 78%, carcass meat from poultry 10.8%, meat in bovine carcass 5.9%, carcass meat pork 2.2% and carcass meat sheep 1.4%, which together represent 98.2% % of state livestock production.[24]\n\nHidalgo has a wide tradition borreguera concentrated in the regions of Apan, Tulancingo de Bravo, Tizayuca, Actopan and Ixmiquilpan.[20] There are seven slaughterhouses and nineteen slaughterhouses, which have coverage in twenty-eight municipalities of the state, with fifty-six municipalities without a registered establishment.\n\nThe products that stand out in their production at the national level are: 2nd place in Meat in the Sheep Canal, 9th place in bovine milk, 6th place in meat in the Guajolote Canal, 15th place in Meat in the Canal of poultry and bee honey.\n\nFishing and aquaculture[edit]\nSeedbeds, livestock grazing, as well as trout fishing; at the dam of San Antonio Rule in Huasca de Ocampo.\n\nAquaculture production in the state has gained relevance in recent years, the consolidation of the trout and tilapia production chains; During the 2013 cycle there was a production volume of 8,000 tons with a production value of 193.5 million pesos.\n\nThe volume of fishing production in Hidalgo is 8,000 tons, ranking 2nd nationally in fishing production in states without coastline.[25] The main species are: carp with 55.6% participation in production, mojarra 39.1% and trout 3.7%, which represent 98.4% of production state.[25]\n\nIt is a state with important fishing and aquaculture activities; produces annually: 3531.3 tons with a value of 52.2 million pesos. The main species caught are mojarra, tilapia, carpa, trout and charal.[23]\n\nThe majority of fishing production in the state is reported without an official record, because the vast majority is destined for self-consumption, there are not enough organized groups and, consequently, there is no National Fisheries Registry.[20]\n\nForestry[edit]\nSilviculture in Calnali.\n\nIn Hidalgo there is a wooded area of cold climate temperate forest where timber species such as pine, oyamel, white cedar and oak are used, the former belonging to the group of the confieras, and the latter to the arborio group of the broad-leaved trees.[26] The forest area of the state is 817 640 ha, of which 454 486 are forest, 252 036 are arid zones and 13 184 are other formations.[27][28] Forestry contributed just under 1% of the state's GDP.[20]\n\nIn Hidalgo, the forest area corresponds to a wooded area of forests of cold climate temperate where timber species such as pine, oyamel, white cedar and oak are used, the former belonging to the group of conifers, and the latter to the arboreal group of broadleaf.[29] According to the State's forest inventory, the land susceptible to reforestation can reach up to 743,224 hectares, of which only 2500 are reforested on an annual average, despite having an infrastructure for the production of plants from more than 60 nurseries in dependencies, communities and municipalities, this is due to the fact that reforestation programs are generally short-term. with limited social participation, insufficient resources and technological obsolescence and in work processes, from the collection of germplasm to the evaluation of reforestation.\n\nForestry activity in the State contributed just under 1% of GDP.[20] Timber forest production in 2009 was 110,000 cubic meters in rolls, with a value of 107.5 million pesos.[20] The process of deforestation goes beyond the reforestation actions carried out by the various agencies, organizations and the social sector.[20]\n\nIn 1997, only 28 000 hectares were exploited, representing 12 per cent of the previous area, in other words there is a potential of 88 per cent of this area that can later be incorporated into commercial exploitation.[29] Of these 28,000 hectares, 63 percent correspond to ejidos of the entity and the remaining 27 percent to small property, that is, most of the forest resources are located on communal property areas and are therefore exploited jointly by the inhabitants of said ejido, the rest of the forest area is used by small owners.[29]\n\nSecondary activities[edit]\n\nThis sector refers to industrial activities, those that transform the resources of the primary sector. Considering the number of companies installed in the state, the sectors with the greatest participation in the industry are: textile, metalmechanical, automotive, construction , food, furniture, jewelry, leather, footwear, chemical and plastic.[30]\n\nMining[edit]\nThe Acosta mine in Mineral del Monte began operations in 1727 and continued its production until 1985.\n\nMining is one of the oldest activities, with a long tradition in the state.[31][32] Mining in the state of Hidalgo accounts for 1.06% of the state's GDP.[33] About 75.4% of the value of mining production corresponds to non-metallic minerals, highlighting gravel, sand and limestone.[33]\n\nApproximately forty-five mines are mined in the state;[34] the municipalities of Tula de Allende, Francisco I. Madero and Zimapán, are producers of limestone deposits, they also produce stone aggregates such as gravel, sand and road seals, and produce raw materials for the production of lime and cement.[35] In Huichapan, Tecozautla and Chapantongo, there are quarry deposits for the construction industry.[35] In Zimapán there are deposits of calcium carbonate.[31] In the municipalities of Agua Blanca de Iturbide and Metepec has deposits of kaolin, an input in the production of the cement industry.[31] Tepehuacán de Guerrero has one of the largest veins of manganese.[35]\n\nThe Pachuca-Real del Monte Mining District is located north of the Mexico Basin, in the Sierra de Pachuca, in the metallogenetic province called Neovolcanic Axis, which explains the presence of polymetallic deposits of silver, lead, zinc, copper and gold. This district is divided into two areas: Pachuca and Real del Monte.[36]\n\nThe mining district of Zimapán is located in the western portion of the state of Hidalgo.[37] This district is made up of a considerable number of mining works that include mines, shafts, levels, shafts, among others, where the Las Ánimas and Lomo de Toro mines have been the most relevant.[37] The morphology of the mineral bodies of the Zimapán mining district is represented by mantles, chimneys and disseminations in both the intrusive and the skarn.[37]\n\nThe Molango mining district is located in the northeastern portion of Hidalgo, approximately 260 km northeast of Mexico City, covering an area of approximately 1250 km2.[37] The deposit is divided into two parts, to the north Tetzintla, with a mineralogy composed of: manganocalcite, kutnahorite, rhodochrosite, and calcite with accessory minerals of clay, quartz, pyrite, magnetite, and plianite. In the southern part of the site (Nonoalco) the mineralogy is composed of nsutite with small amounts of psilomelane, pyrolusite, cryptomelane and hausmanite.[37]\n\nVolume of mineral production in tonnes\nMineral\tYear 2003[38]\tYear 2004[39]\tYear 2005[40]\tYear 2006[41]\tYear 2007[42]\nGold\t79.1\t43.8\t41.6\t7.1\t11.5\nSilver\t25 360\t17 448\t17 448\t30 582\t15 614\nLead\t1057\t1057\t1331\t——\t4428\nCopper\t118\t118\t254\t1,068\t1,437\nZinc\t4775\t4775\t6616\t——\t16 687\nManganese\t114.550\t114.550\t135.896\t132.872\t——\nSulphur\t——\t61 026\t——\t33 175\t54 414 \nFood industry[edit]\nPachuca-Tizayuca Valley, where the Tizayuca Dairy Basin is located.\n\nIn terms of processing agricultural and livestock products, there are 3518 establishments dedicated to this area, the municipalities with the highest number are Pachuca, Ixmiquilpan, Actopan, and Tula, which together represent 29.8% of the total.[22]\n\nThe products that make up the food industry sector in the state are: coffee, malt, honey, jams, sauces, carbonated beverages and carbonated water, products for breadification and food additives, sausagess, fryings and milk and their derivatives such as: cheese, Heavy cream, yogurt and ice cream among others.[23]\n\nThe Tizayuca Dairy Basin, created in 1976, has the Tizayuca Agroindustrial Complex (Caitsa) and occupies 120 h of land, in which 126 stables and 25,000 cows are located.[43] There are 90 producers working there, generating 2300 direct jobs and 7500 indirect jobs, and a combined production of 500,000 liters of milk.[44] In the 1990s, the ranchers created their own production and marketing company under the name of Leche Real de Tizayuca, but in 2009 it went bankrupt.[45] In 1976, the dairy basin produced 2.8 million liters per week,[45] in 2008 its production was around 1.4 million per week,[45] and in 2010 the production is around 500,000 liters per week.[46] In 2012, the 70 active stables sold their product to firms such as: Santa Clara, Alpura, and Liconsa.[45]\n\nThe Santa Clara Productos Lácteos company was founded in Pachuca in 1924 with just a small herd of 17 Creole cows and in 2012 it is classified among the top 5 Mexican dairy groups, manufacturer of milk, yogurt, cream, ice cream, cheese and coffee.[47] It processes more than 200,000 liters of milk per day, of which 75% is used for milk and the remaining 25  % is used for the production of ice cream, yogurt and cheese.[47] In Tizayuca there is a plant of the company Fritos Totis.\n\nManufacturing[edit]\n\nManufacturing industries are the most important sector in Hidalgo, contributing 28.84% of Hidalgo's GDP.[3] In the area of productive infrastructure, the state has thirteen industrial and/or technological parks operating, located in Pachuca de Soto, Mineral de la Reforma, Tula de Allende, Tizayuca, Huejutla de Reyes, Atitalaquia and Ciudad Sahagún.[9]\n\nThe textile and clothing sector is one of the most important sectors for Hidalgo. The municipalities with the highest levels of production of textile inputs and finishes, textile products and clothing are Tepeji del Río de Ocampo, Tizayuca, Tlaxcoapan, Zapotlán, Tlanalapa, Tepeapulco, Pachuca de Soto, Mineral de la Reforma, Progreso de Obregón, Actopan, Cuautepec de Hinojosa and Tulancingo de Bravo.[48]\n\nIn 1952, the industrial zone of Ciudad Sahagún was created, it was considered the most important industrial center in Mexico, the area had about 40,000 workers. In 1986 a cycle of 36 years of industrial heyday came to an end, in which the companies Constructora Nacional de Carros de Ferrocarril (CNCF), Diesel Nacional S.A. (Dina), Dikona (Dina-Komatsu) and National Steelworks (Sidena), closed. [49] In 2008, there were three major companies located in the industrial corridor of Ciudad Sahagún: the U.S. transnational ASF-Keystone, the Canadian Bombardier-Concarril and the Japanese Komatsu Mexicana, which reached 3,200 jobs between them.[50] There are 17 medium-sized companies, divided into metalworking, automotive and railway; there are Aceros Corsa, Aerospace, American Coach, CAPDTIMM, CAPROME, CIMMATH, Dina-Camiones, Ferro Partes Mexicanas, Giant Motors, Global Transporte, Grupo Bler, Gunderson-Concarril, Kapton, Maquinados Teysa, MET-MET, SYCSA, Té Laggs and Timsa.[50] In addition, there are 40 micro-enterprises, including the maquilado, embroidery, dairy products and profiling of metalworking parts, associated in the corporation called Industriales de Sahagún, AC (ISAC).[50] Industries in the area account for almost 11,800 established jobs.[50]\n\nPetroleum industry[edit]\nPanoramic view of the Miguel Hidalgo Refinery in Tula de Allende.\n\nAs for the oil industry, there is the \"Miguel Hidalgo\" refinery in Tula de Allende, its facilities occupy a total area of 749 hectares;[51] It was the first refinery to be fully planned with high-capacity hydrocarbon processing plants.[51] Its construction was carried out in several stages, the first stage being inaugurated on March 18, 1976. [52]\n\nThis refinery is considered one of the most important in the country due to its installed capacity, and the share of the market it controls, since it processes 24% of the total crude oil that is refined in Mexico.[51] The average production volume of refined products was 127,821,900  barrels, of which 40.1% corresponded to gasoline; 28.5% to fuel oil; 19.3% to diesel; 6.3% to kerosene and the remainder to liquefied gas, industrial fuel and asphalts.[51] In addition, three important gas pipelines pass through the state (Poza Rica-Venta de Carpio, Zempoala-Salamanca and Tabasco-Salamanca).[34]\n\nThe petrochemical industry produced 263 974 tonnes in 1998; Of these, 15.9% corresponded to sulphur, 20.2% to acrylonitrile, 36.9  % to propylene, 24.3% to carbon black and the rest to hydrocyanic acid and acetonitrile.[23]\n\nConstruction[edit]\n\nThe construction industry participated in 1997 with 3.61% of Hidalgo's GDP; This percentage is slightly lower than the national average of 4.6%).[23] In 1998, the value of production in the construction industry amounted to 298.6 million pesos, of which 77.2% was public works and 22.8% private works.[23] Of this amount, 29.5% corresponded to buildings, 25.3% to transport, 16.1% to oil and petrochemicals, 12.7% to other constructions, 10% to electricity and communications and 6.4% to water, irrigation and sanitation.[23] There are 146 construction companies in the state: 127 are micro, 8 small, 4 medium and 7 large, employing 2054 employees and workers.[23]\n\nThe Cementera Cruz Azul is a Mexican company in the construction industry.[53] It has four plants, one of which is located in the Cruz Azul Cooperative City, the city was born with the installation of a cement factory at the end of the 19th century, installed in what was the former Hacienda de Jasso, in the southwest of the state within the municipality of Tula de Allende.[53]\n\nThe cement industry is made up of four large companies: Cementos Mexicanos, Cruz Azul, Portland Blanco de México and Apasco, whose growth has been significant in recent years, generating a significant economic spillover in the state.[23] The Cementera Santa Anita crusher and materials processing plant has about 372 hectares in the Mezquital Valley; This plant generated around 1,200 jobs during its construction; Already in operation, it represents no less than 900 direct and indirect jobs.\n\nEnergy[edit]\nReservoir formed by the Zimapán Dam.\n\nIn electricity, this sector accounted for 3.87% of the state's GDP in 1997 , higher than the national average (1.2%), and 4.3% of the national electricity GDP.[23] In the same year, Hidalgo accounted for 8.7% of the total electricity generated in the country.[23] Of the energy generated, 91.5% comes from thermoelectric plants. The value of sales was 996.2 million pesos.[23] In terms of the degree of electrification of the State, in 1998 a total of 1405 localities were served, with 469,028 electrical outlets.[23]\n\nIn terms of power generation, the state is self-sufficient as it has electricity generating plants in different municipalities, the state generates 9.4% of the country's electrical energy with 2900 megawatts (MW).[34] The Fernando Hiriart Balderrama Dam, located in the riverbed that joins the rivers Tula and Moctezuma at Zimapán was launched on September 27, 1996. [54] The curtain has a height of 203 meters from the floor to the crown and has a hydroelectric power plant capable of generating 292 megawatts of electricity.[55]\n\nTertiary activities[edit]\nTrade[edit]\nSee also: Shopping malls in the state of Hidalgo\n\nCommerce in the state has been stable in recent years; being the second sector with the highest contribution to the state's GDP.[56] Hidalgo has seven supply centers, 60 markets, and 211 tianguis.[56] 54% of the municipalities do not have a public market and the inhabitants of these municipalities are supplied through tianguis that are set up at least once a week.[56]\n\nBy branches commercial, the most important in terms of the personnel it employs, is that of retail food products, which includes groceries, butchers, poultry shops and others.[20] Secondly, we have pharmaciess, haberdashery, shoe stores, and clothing stores, among others.[20]\n\nThirdly, according to its importance, is the wholesale food trade, where we find establishments distributing fruits, eggs, groceries, beverages and others.[20] Trade is concentrated in the main urban centers such as Pachuca de Soto, Tulancingo de Bravo, Actopan, Huejutla de Reyes and Tula de Allende.[20] Hidalgo's foreign trade went from a deficit in 2000 to 2004 to a surplus from 2005 to 2009. The main export products during the period from January to December 2009 were vehicles and railway equipment, cotton, clothing and accessories, rubber and its derivatives, machinery, apparatus and mechanical devices.[20]\n\nDuring 2014 in Hidalgo, the value of exports reached an amount of 1721.6 million pesos, which represented 0.5% at the national level. The manufacturing industry stood out as the main activity with an export value of 1,719.1 million pesos.[9] The subsectors with the highest participation were: petroleum and coal products (40.1%) and transport equipment (34.4%).[4] With respect to remittances, it reached a total of 725.2 million pesos during the period January–December 2015.[9]\n\nTourism[edit]\nTuribus in Real del Monte; other cities that have this service are Actopan and Pachuca.\n\nThe state of Hidalgo can be consolidated as an important tourist destination in Mexico, representing 1.6% of the national tourism offer.[57] It also offers a wide market of tourist services, 567 hotels, 598 restaurants, 102 spas, 93 bars, 22 nightclubs, 74 travel agencies, 5 hunting ranches, 39 rental and transport companies and five golf courses.[57]\n\nThe State of Hidalgo is divided into six tourist corridors: the Spa Corridor, the Mountain Corridor, the Four Elements Corridor, the Toltec Corridor, the Hacienda Corridor and the Sierra-Huasteca Corridor, which represent differentiated levels of development and tourism products.[57]\n\nTourist destinations are visited annually by an average of 1,800,000  tourists.[58] In 2010 alone, 310,322 tourists arrived in Pachuca, of which 86% (276,351 ) were residents of the country. At the state level, 1,063,757  tourists arrived at lodging establishments, with a percentage of 94% of national origin.[59] The Hidalgo Fair receives an average of 750 to 850 thousand visitors per edition.[60]\n\nSpa Corridor[edit]\nTe-Pathé Spa in Ixmiquilpan.\n\nWithin the Mezquital Valley is one of the most representative areas of the Otomi region. Located at more than 1500 m s. n. m., enjoys a benign climate, conducive to the most interesting tourist explorations.[61]\n\nThe Spa Corridor is characterized by spas of thermal waters, which spring at average temperatures of 38 °C, since the geographical location places it On the Transversal Neovolcanic Axis and therefore beneath the earth there are cracks and magma rivers that heat the aquifers and enrich them with minerals, sulfates, carbons and nitrates; This corridor passes through the municipalities of El Arenal, Cardonal, Actopan, Santiago de Anaya, Ixmiquilpan, Tasquillo, Tecozautla and Huichapan.[61]\n\nMountain Corridor[edit]\nBasaltic Prisons of Santa María Regla.\n\nThe name of the corridor is born due to the geographical area it occupies within the state of Hidalgo, due to the natural characteristics of each municipality that integrates it.[62] The Mountain Corridor is visited for its attractive ecotourism, where you can practice sports such as rappelling, mountaineering, canoeing, sport fishing and paragliding.[62]\n\nHere we find interesting examples of historical monuments, both civil and religious, as well as their mining haciendas of the 17th century built by Pedro Romero de Terreros, the Count of Regla. It has the mining towns of Huasca de Ocampo, Real del Monte and Mineral del Chico, which are part of the program called Magical Towns. [63]\n\nCorridor of the 4 Elements[edit]\nMonumental Clock of Acaxochitlán.\n\nAccording to the characteristics of this, the route name of the 4 elements is defined by knowing what each of them offered, the air, which allows you to live the experience of flying in a hot air balloon, the water present in the immense waterfalls and lagoons where you can practice sport fishing or, take a boat ride, the fire, through the manufacture of cast iron products in the Apulco factory and the land, through its expanses and beautiful landscapes, where exotic food such as deer, crocodile and ostrich stand out.[64][65] It is made up of the municipalities of Tulancingo, Acaxochitlán, Metepec, Tenango de Doria and San Bartolo Tutotepec.[61][65]\n\nToltec Corridor[edit]\n\nThe Toltec Corridor because of the geographical area it occupies within the state, the Toltec culture, is characterized by the municipalities of Mixquiahuala, Tlahuelilpan, Atotonilco de Tula, Tula de Allende and Tepeji del Río.[66][65]\n\nThis corridor is characterized by the diversity of attractions, history and tradition that exist in each of its municipalities, when making a tour you can visit from the archaeological zone of Tula, one of the human settlements of great importance in Mesoamerica, to magnificent former convents of the 16th century, or hot springs that gush at more than 38 °C.[64][65]\n\nPanoramic view of Tollan-Xicocotitlan.\nCorridor of the haciendas[edit]\nAqueduct of Padre Tembleque.\n\nThe Corridor of the Haciendas, on this route there are the centers of haciendas that were built during the 16th century, 17th century, 18th century and 19th century, is made up of municipalities of Zempoala, Tepeapulco and Apan.[64][65] This corridor is made up of municipalities in which you can visit from typical villages that preserve their roots, to the area of the altiplanicie pulquera, where it is advisable to visit the haciendas dedicated to the production of pulque, as well as some of the religious complexes, an archaeological zone, and civil constructions such as the Aqueduct of Padre Tembleque.[64][65]\n\nCorridor of the Sierra and the Huasteca[edit]\nHuejutla de Reyes.\n\nThis is an adventurous route, so it is recommended to go with an explorer's mindset.[62][65] It is a route for contact with nature, landscapes and very suitable for photography; it runs through the area known as Sierra Baja and Alta, to end in the Huasteca. Due to its hot and humid climate, its impressive landscapes, its delicious dishes and its crafts, it is essential to dedicate a good time to this tour.[66][65]\n\nUrban corridor of Pachuca and its surroundings[edit]\n\nPachuca is the most important city in the state. The municipality's tourism infrastructure is as follows: 32 lodging establishments with a capacity of 1,471 rooms, 157 beverage and food preparation establishments and 36 travel agencies, 13 car rental companies, 4 convention centers and 1 golf course.[59]\n\nThe main tourist attractions of the city are the buildingss, monuments, and museumss of the historic center, as well as the various cultural centers in the other parts of the city, highlighting the David Ben Gurion Park.[67] The Hidalgo Stadium is a major tourist attraction, especially during the matches of the Primera División of Mexican Soccer.[67] In the city there is a Turibus called Tranvía Turístico de Pachuca, installed in 2003 that runs through the main attractions of the city center.[67]\n\nThe Calinda Hotel which was established in 1987 and is now Fiesta Inn, later the Hotel Excelencia Plaza in 1992, Hotel La Joya in 1993, the Camino Real Hotel in charge of the Angeles Business Group (formerly Crowne Plaza Hotel) which was established in 2005; and the Holiday Inn Hotel are a sample of the hotelses in the city.
