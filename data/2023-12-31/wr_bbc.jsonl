The BBC is not able to verify the Russian claims that Czech ammunition was used.\nDuring the meeting, Russia's envoy to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, accused Ukraine of carrying out a \"deliberate, indiscriminate attack against a civilian target\".\nHis remarks were promptly refuted by Ukraine's allies, with the French envoy saying that Ukraine was defending itself under UN laws, while others including the US and UK said President Vladimir Putin was responsible for Russian deaths by starting the conflict.\nThe UN assistant secretary-general, Mohamed Khiari, \"unequivocally condemned\" the attacks on both sides and said strikes against civilians and civilian infrastructure \"violate international humanitarian law, are unacceptable and must end now\".\nVideo from one of the strikes - which the BBC has verified but chosen not to share - shows a pile-up of cars, some of which are on fire, and at least one person lying motionless on the road.\nThe sound of loud bangs and car horns can be heard throughout. Before thick black smoke obscures the scene, someone is seen running to assist the person lying on the road.\n\"Today, shelling by the armed forces of Ukraine has had the most severe consequences of the last two years,\" Belgorod's regional governor wrote in a Telegram post.\nThe Russian defence ministry said Kyiv was \"trying to distract attention from defeats at the front, and is also wanting to provoke us\".\nThe statement added: \"This crime will not go unpunished.\"\nLate on Saturday, the governor of Ukraine's Kherson region said one person had been killed during Russian shelling of a residential building.\nAt the same time, Russian strikes injured 19 in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the local government reported.\nRussia launched six rocket attacks on the city, the head of Kharkiv's regional administration said. He added that two children and a foreign national were among those injured.\nThe Russian defence ministry earlier said 13 missiles had been destroyed over the wider Belgorod region - and 32 drones had been shot down in the Bryansk, Oryol, Kursk and Moscow regions.\nThe Bryansk governor said two villages were targeted and a child had been killed.\nUkrainian media - citing intelligence sources - reported that a group of drones hit an electronics factory in that same region, saying the facility had been used to make Russian military equipment.\nMoscow has repeatedly accused Ukraine of being behind drone strikes in recent months. Kyiv rarely admits to such attacks across the border, although it has carried out strikes like this before.\nRussia's massive bombardment of Ukraine on Friday killed 39 people and injured nearly 160, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Several cities were hit, including the capital, Kyiv.\nMayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitchsko said at least 16 people were killed in the city - making Friday the deadliest day so far for civilians in the capital.\nAn emergency meeting of the UN Security Council that same evening overwhelmingly condemned Russia's renewed mass-bombing campaign in Ukraine and said attacks had to stop \"immediately\".\nCountries including the US, UK and France said hitting civilian infrastructure had violated the international rules of war.\n\"Rather than peace, Putin chose to mark this holiday season... with an unprecedented number of drone and missile attacks,\" US representative to the UN John Kelly said.\nRussia said Ukrainian air defences were to blame for causing damage to civilian buildings."}

It's pretty cool. It all comes full circle.\"\nSpeaking on Friday, he called Thursday \"one of the best days in my lifetime for sure\".\nOn his third wave of the day, he fired into the barrel of a massive collapsing wall of water.\n\"It was an honour. And just to get barrelled is a whole other realm of victory,\" he says with a triumphant laugh. \n\"So I'm pretty happy about it.\"\nForecasters have issued warnings of more danger ahead after a rogue wave swept pedestrians off their feet and swamped a hotel in Ventura.\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) warned of \"extremely dangerous conditions.\" \n\"Powerful waves and life-threatening rip currents pose an exceptional risk of ocean drowning and damage to coastal structures.\"\nThe NWS said there is \"an increased risk for ocean drowning\" due to rip currents.\nMore swells are in the forecast for Mavericks, located near the city of Half Moon Bay. \nBut only the world's top professionals should consider getting into the ocean during this El NiÃ±o-driven weather event. \n\"Mavericks is kind of the biggest of the big here on the West Coast,\" Mr Cuvelier said. \"But I don't think any beginner or even intermediate surfers should really be surfing anywhere in California (in these conditions).\""}

It says a further 56,165 Palestinians have been injured.\nAccess to humanitarian aid in the 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide enclave has been tightly controlled since the start of the war.\nAt the start of its military campaign, Israeli forces focused on Gaza's north. But more recently, they have been pounding Khan Younis in southern Gaza, which they see as a stronghold for Hamas.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a TV address on Saturday evening that Israel was \"fighting on all fronts\".\nHe echoed remarks by the chief of general staff, saying the war would go on \"for many months\", until Israel achieved \"the release of all our hostages and the dismantlement of Hamas\".\nSpeaking from Rafah, UNRWA's Gaza director Tom White told the BBC there were \"well over a million people\" seeking safety in the city.\nMr White said that for \"hundreds of thousands of people\" seeking safety in Rafah, \"there are no spots left\" in shelters - which included UNRWA schools and other municipal facilities.\nHe echoed comments made by Ms Touma, explaining that \"hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people are now sleeping in the open under flimsy pieces of plastic\" as a result of the overcrowding.\nIn its latest report, UNRWA said up to 1.9m people have been displaced across the Gaza Strip since the start of the war.\nAccording to OCHA, the most recent wave of displacement into Rafah is due to intense fighting in Khan Younis and other parts of the territory.\nResidents in Khan Younis have reported intense gun battles between Israeli troops and Hamas fighters.\nElsewhere in Gaza on Saturday, fighting was also reported in the Nuseirat refugee camp, Maghazi and in al-Bureij.\nIn a statement on X, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Arabic-language spokesman warned that the main north-south road in Gaza, the Salah al-Din, was a \"battlefield\" and \"dangerous to reach\".\nMeanwhile, a third UN body - the World Health Organization (WHO) - has again warned of a spike in the spread of infectious diseases across Gaza's displaced community.\nWHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said there had been a rise in the number of diseases across Gaza between mid-October and mid-December.\nHe said that across UN shelters there had been some 136,400 cases of diarrhoea, 55,400 cases of lice and scabies, and 126 cases of meningitis."}

Made every actor better.\n\"He was the epitome of elegance and he will be dearly missed by all of us.\"\nWith more than 130 film and TV credits in total, Wilkinson was as comfortable in period dramas like 1995's Sense and Sensibility and 2013's Belle, as he was playing criminal masterminds in movies like Rush Hour opposite Jackie Chan in 1998, or Guy Ritchie's RocknRolla in 2008.\nHe also earned an Emmy for playing US political figure Benjamin Franklin in 2008 mini-series John Adams and an Emmy nomination as John F Kennedy's father Joe in The Kennedys. He played President Lyndon B Johnson in 2014's Selma, and appeared in The Grand Budapest Hotel and Girl with a Pearl Earring.\nHis death on Saturday was confirmed in a statement shared by his agent on behalf of his family.\nWilkinson was, according to the Encyclopaedia of British Film, \"a major character star, with a remarkable gift - one among several - for conveying inner pain\".\nRobert Carlyle, who starred alongside Wilkinson in The Full Monty, described him, as \"a huge performer, a real titan of an actor, one of the greats of not only his, but of any generation.\"\nIn a tribute on X, formerly Twitter, British actor Phil Davis called him \"powerful and delicate and hugely intelligent - one of the very best\", while singer and actor Will Young described him as \"British acting royalty\".\nUS film maker Scott Derrickson said Wilkinson was \"an amazing talent\" and recalled a time when the actor gave him a surprise kiss on the lips on the set of The Exorcism of Emily Rose.\nBorn in Leeds before moving to Canada and then Cornwall in childhood, he found his calling at the age of 18 when he was asked to direct a play.\n\"For the first time in my life, I started doing something I knew how to do,\" he said.\n\"I realised it wasn't necessarily just these southern middle-class types that got to be actors; it could possibly be people like me. And once I knew, I never changed my mind.\"\nHe trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) before following the well-worn path to theatre and television work. In 1986, he got his first major screen role in mini-series First Among Equals, based on Jeffrey Archer's best-selling novel.\nPlaying alongside him was Diana Hardcastle. The couple married in 1988, and also went on to play husband and wife in The Kennedys in 2011, and in 2014 action film Good People. The couple had two daughters, Alice and Molly.\nWhen he portrayed Pecksniff in Martin Chuzzlewit for the BBC in 1994, Wilkinson said: \"I looked at it and I thought, I can't get it any better than that. It came out exactly as I meant it to come out. It won a couple of prizes and I thought, I can act, there's no question.\"\nThree years later, he was cast as a former factory foreman who joins fellow unemployed workmates in staging a strip show in The Full Monty.\n\"I was simultaneously offered the lead in a TV series and a possible part in a low-budget movie,\" he told The Guardian.\n\"I remember phoning a friend and he said, 'Take the TV, take the TV'. But I didn't follow his advice, and the TV turned out to be crap.\"\nThe low-budget movie, meanwhile, turned out to be the highest-grossing British film up to that point, and took his career to a new level on both sides of the Atlantic.\nWilkinson received high critical acclaim for Todd Field's 2001 US domestic drama In the Bedroom, in which he played a bereaved father. He was nominated for an Oscar for best actor.\nHe hoped the film would do two things for him, he later said. \"One, [prove] I could play the lead role in a movie. Two, I could play an American lead role. And it did both of those things.\"\nThe actor earned his second Academy Award nomination for his supporting role in Tony Gilroy's 2007 legal thriller Michael Clayton, starring George Clooney.\nWilkinson's other credits included Batman Begins, The Patriot, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Gathering Storm, Black Knight, Valkyrie, The Lone Ranger and Denial.\nHe also provided the voice of the fox in the TV adaptation of children's best-seller The Gruffalo.\nHis long term agent Lou Coulson has described him in interviews as \"one of the best\".\nOff screen, Wilkinson was known for being down-to-earth and keeping a relatively low profile. He said in an interview: \"I like to go to Waitrose and not be recognised.\"\nIn the 2005 New Year Honours, Wilkinson was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to drama."}

France announced it was withdrawing troops last year.\nMali has been run by military leaders following two coups in 2020 and 2021.\nThe country has been struggling with a widespread jihadist insurgency that has made much of the north and east ungovernable.\nIn recent years, Islamic State in the Greater Sahara had made major gains, occupying large swathes of territory in southeast Mali. \nMany central regions have also recently been experiencing a surge in violence perpetrated by militants linked to al-Qaeda and Islamic State groups.\nFighting also broke out again in August between the separatists and government troops after eight years of calm, as both sides scrambled to fill the vacuum left by the withdrawal of the UN peacekeepers."}

This new game took the original's vast open world and added the ability - called ultrahand - to craft contraptions by fusing together pretty much anything you can find.\nThat sort of freedom usually terrifies developers because it creates so much room for things to go wrong. But it worked, despite the ageing Switch hardware.\n\"Ultrahand is one of the best additions to the series and the things we can make with it are hilarious and useful,\" says Scottish Twitch streamer Argick.\n\"There's so much to do in the game and you can do it in pretty much any order you want without the game trying to push you elsewhere - I've still got to explore the rest of the depths.\"\nJust when we thought triple-A games were becoming safe and stale, along comes Alan Wake 2.\nIt is a bit like Finnish studio Remedy's previous leftfield works, but with an extra layer of weirdness splodged on top.\nThe supernatural horror narrative, told through the eyes of two main characters, made a lasting impression. The sumptuous presentation, mix of gameplay and live action, and wider themes made it feel like one of a kind.\nAnd one memorable musical sequence - featuring the fictional band Old Gods of Asgard - became one of the most-talked about gaming moments of the year.\n\"That is one of the best set pieces of 2023 for me,\" said Argick. \"The song and the way it's all intertwined in the game world.\n\"It just makes that entire moment something special.\"\nSpider-Man 2 had a huge weight resting on its shoulders.\nThe current release slate for Sony - which makes the PlayStation 5 console - is thin and so it needed a win from Spider-Man 2, a game developed by PlayStation studio Insomniac.\nThankfully, it got it. This tightly crafted adventure landed exclusively on the PlayStation 5 to excellent reviews and became the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game ever.\nIt was a cinematic, technical showcase. Plus, players enjoyed the diverse cast of characters and moving story, even if the gameplay wasn't a huge departure from other Spider-Man games.\nSome players griped about the relatively short playtime, but the developers insisted it was worth the price of entry.\nInsomniac ended the year as the victim of a huge ransomware attack, but until then, most of the discussion about the studio was people praising its latest, greatest title.\nFortnite, the last-player standing shooting game, has more than 400 million registered players, but its makers aren't shy about wanting more.\nThat's probably even more true after its maker, Epic Games, laid off 800 staff earlier this year.\nOne big bid to draw in new users was its high-profile collaboration with Lego for a new mode called Lego Fortnite. Twitch streamer Dando said the mode - which replaces Fortnite's existing crafting materials with the famous bricks - was \"amazing\".\n\"It brings in that element of crafting, building and gathering resources - it's just one of those games you can turn on, switch off, and just be in another world.\"\nLego Fortnite launched alongside Rocket Racing and Fortnite Festival - two other modes designed to attract more people.\nDando said: \"Eventually you'll just launch Fortnite and if you're feeling a certain genre, you don't need to leave the game.\"\nEveryone loves a redemption arc, and that's what they got with this expansion to Cyberpunk 2077.\nPolish studio CD Projekt Red has been on a quest to repair its reputation after the disastrous 2020 launch of the base game.\nExpansion Phantom Liberty - as well as a 2.0 update which fixed the main game from top to bottom - was hailed as delivering the version of the game players should have had first time around.\nHaving Idris Elba in the starring role, and a story many players called genuinely moving, certainly didn't hurt.\nIt's not quite an underdog story (the main game sold more than 20 million copies) but it was happier ending to a turbulent tale.\n\"This is the kind of thing I love - seeing a game come out the other end like that,\" said Dando. \"It is almost like they've revived themselves.\"\nIt was perhaps the most divisive game of 2023, with some outlets refusing to review it at all because of Harry Potter author JK Rowling's public comments relating to transgender people.\nThe author was kept at arms' length from this project, but it didn't stop loud calls for boycotts around the game's release.\nSome critics gave it low scores, arguing it was impossible to separate art from artist, and some streamers opted not to play it despite the huge viewership numbers it generated. Ten months on from release, feelings are still strong.\nAs for whether it was any good, detractors criticised its repetitive combat and missions - but fans would tell you that it was enchanting to explore detailed replicas of their favourite locations from the stories.\nAnd despite the protests, analysis from GamesIndustry.biz suggests that, in terms of physical copies, it was the best-selling game of 2023 in both the United Kingdom and United States.\nPre-release hype for Starfield promised players the universe, but when they finally got the game its galactic exploration was not quite what many expected.\nThey got plenty of space - in the form of empty planets - but navigating between worlds was mostly hands-free and menu-based.\n\"It was immersive and it was really pleasant to just run about but then some of the mechanics themselves just felt a bit clunky,\" said Dando.\nMany fans felt Starfield didn't live up to previous titles from studio Bethesda - the makers of the beloved Fallout and Elder Scrolls series.\nBut it broke records for the developer and for publisher Microsoft - no doubt driven by its availability on the Netflix-style Game Pass service.\nSince that initial wave, Starfield's had a hard time on digital storefront Steam, where it's been hit with negative reviews.\nBethesda's promised regular updates and new features in 2024, so the adventure might not be over just yet.\nOne of the biggest gaming stories of this year concerned something that's not expected until 2025: Grand Theft Auto VI.\nA 90-second trailer released in early December racked up 90.4 million views in 24 hours.\nIt confirmed much of what we already knew from leaks, such as the presence of the series' first voice-acted female protagonist.\nBut finally seeing the Rockstar-approved version of its debauched, riotous virtual Miami after almost 10 years of waiting sent fans wild.\nArgick said: \"GTA VI going back to Vice City and looking like it has a Bonnie and Clyde theme going on has me thinking about grabbing it - it's absolutely going to be one of the biggest releases of the year when it drops.\n\"The trailer is sending waves throughout the gaming community.\"\nWhen the game proper releases, you can expect the effect to be seismic."}

So what does it mean for next year's general election?\nMr Trump is the clear frontrunner to be the Republican nominee in November 2024 and challenge Joe Biden for the White House. His campaign described both decisions as \"atrocious\" and an \"attempted theft of an election\".\nThe top election official in Maine ruled the former president was ineligible to run because of his actions around the Capitol riot. Colorado's highest court issued a similar, unprecedented, ruling just days earlier.\nBut it is still uncertain whether Mr Trump's name will appear on the ballot when the two states pick their Republican candidate in the coming months, as both rulings are on hold while an appeals process plays out.\nUnlike in Colorado, where the state's Supreme Court ruled on Mr Trump's eligibility, in Maine it was decided by the top electoral official because of a quirk in its constitution.\nSecretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat, issued a 34-page ruling that said Mr Trump must be removed from its Republican primary ballot because of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.\nSection 3 disqualifies people who engage in \"insurrection or rebellion\" from holding federal office.\nHer order said Mr Trump \"over the course of several months and culminating on January 6 2021, used a false narrative of election fraud to inflame his supporters and direct them to the Capitol\".\nMs Bellows, an elected official, was accused of making a politically motivated decision by the Trump campaign. She denied this and said it was \"thorough and based on the rule of law\".\nSpeaking to BBC News after her ruling, Ms Bellows said it was her duty to uphold election laws in her state, and that she hoped the \"Supreme Court will settle this matter nationwide\".\nOn 19 December, the Colorado Supreme Court said it found \"clear and convincing evidence that President Trump engaged in insurrection\".\nIt was the first time Section 3 had been used to disqualify a presidential candidate.\nThe lengthy 213-page ruling said Mr Trump's actions in the build-up to 6 January 2021 did constitute insurrection.\nHis lawyers had argued in Colorado that he should not be disqualified because he did not bear responsibility for the riot.\nThey also noted that Mr Trump has not been charged with inciting insurrection.\nYes. These rulings only apply to Colorado and Maine respectively.\nHours after Maine's ruling, California's elected secretary of state, a Democrat, ignored calls to remove Mr Trump from the state's Republican primary ballot - saying it was a matter for the courts. Michigan's top court this week declined to hear a case seeking to disqualify Mr Trump.\nMr Trump is far ahead of his Republican rivals so can still win his party's nomination without competing in Colorado or Maine.\nIn the US, the two main parties nominate a presidential candidate by holding a series of state primaries and caucuses that begin in January.\nIn terms of the general election, in both states, Joe Biden won against Donald Trump in 2020 by a wide margin, and it is unlikely that Mr Trump will need to win the states to enter the White House once more.\nIt is now likely that the US Supreme Court will intervene to offer a ruling that would apply nationally.\nThat's because the Colorado Republican Party has appealed the state's ruling to the Supreme Court.\nThe top US court will decide whether to take up the case in the new year, but it is not clear when.\nMr Trump's name will remain on the ballot in Colorado until the Supreme Court makes a ruling or, in a less likely outcome, decides not to take up the case.\nThe Maine ruling is also on hold pending a legal appeal in the state's courts. Any decision by the US Supreme Court could supersede this and apply nationally.\nThe US justices will have to consider the legal arguments which will take time, but they will be under pressure to decide before the Colorado and Maine primaries on 5 March, the so-called Super Tuesday when the greatest number of states hold ballots.\nThe balance of that court has shifted to more conservative in recent years, thanks in part to three justices who were appointed by Mr Trump when he was president.\nAlmost everything about the situation is unprecedented, leaving lingering questions about how this may affect the general election.\nMaeva Marcus, the director of the Institute for Constitutional Studies at George Washington University, says the same \"rationale\" behind the Colorado ruling that disqualified Mr Trump from the primary ballot would \"hold for the general election\".\nBut it's too early to say what will happen in the general election in November until the issue works its way through the courts, she said.\nThere are two key legal issues to consider.\nOne is whether Mr Trump's actions in the build-up to the storming of the US Capitol amount to insurrection.\nThe other is whether the office holders that Section 3 was aimed at barring should include the president.\nA lower court in Colorado has already ruled that Mr Trump engaged in insurrection but the law did not apply to the office of the presidency.\nThe Colorado Supreme Court disagreed, and top legal scholars are divided on whether this law should apply to Mr Trump.\nLawyers for Mr Trump dispute that he engaged in insurrection and argue his remarks to supporters on the day of the 2021 riot were protected by his right to free speech.\nMr Trump's campaign said the latest ruling is another example of the justice system being used to persecute him.\nBut there could be wider implications for the general election.\nDozens of other US states have similar lawsuits trying to bar Mr Trump from running, and the decisions in Colorado and Maine could make it more likely some of them succeed.\nIf Mr Trump was stopped from running in a state where he and Mr Biden are neck-and-neck, that could be critical in a presidential race that is expected to be closely fought."}

Ellie went on to make history as the first model with the condition to feature on the front cover of Vogue.\nNow aged 22, she has just bought her own home in Essex and recently published a book about her life, called Against All Odds.\nHere, in their own words, the model and her mother Yvonne explain how Ellie has been defying expectations since the day she was born.\nWhen Ellie was born, we were shocked to learn she had Down's syndrome. The doctors said she would never walk or talk and a nurse suggested we might want to leave her at the hospital. I struggled to accept her diagnosis and bond with her.\nWe were told Ellie needed heart surgery so I was really nervous about getting close to her. When she was five months old, she had a 10-hour operation to close holes in her heart. She spent 10 days in intensive care and another week in the high dependency unit.\nAfter three weeks, we were able to take her home and her cheeky and determined personality began to shine through. My husband and I decided to bring her up as Ellie first and put the fact that she has got Down's syndrome to one side.\nDespite what the doctors said, she could walk by 18 months, was speaking by her third birthday and was able to read by the time she started school. Ellie stayed in mainstream education until it came to doing her exams and we moved her to a specialist school.\nWhen she was a teenager, we decided to tell Ellie that she had Down's syndrome. We were nervous about her reaction and showed her a special book but she kept saying, \"I don't look like that. I'm me.\" I was worried it would knock her confidence, but it didn't.\nOne day my friend told me about a new talent agency called Zebedee, which wanted to work with people with disabilities and visible differences, so I decided to apply for Ellie.\nNot long after joining, Ellie was chosen to star in Superdrug's Christmas advert in 2018. Her career really took off from there. My mum always used to say, \"She's definitely going to be someone one day.\" She is very headstrong and feisty but that's what makes her Ellie.\nEllie still really shocks me, she just loves the camera and the attention, I can just see how much she enjoys it and loves it and that makes it all worthwhile.\nEllie recently bought her own home with the proceeds from her modelling but we don't know if she will ever be able to live alone. We are living alongside her for now, though we have kept our family home, and we are trying to encourage her to be more independent but she is still very vulnerable.\nWe have to prepare her for how she will cope one day when we're not around. Her older sister Amy will obviously look out for her but we would never put that full responsibility on her.\nI hope attitudes towards Down's syndrome have changed since Ellie was born but there is still a lot of ignorance. Often in the street, people ask me questions about Ellie and don't address her. They don't realise she can talk and how big a personality she has.\nI always wanted to be a model but I didn't see anyone who looked like me on magazine covers so I wasn't sure if I could do it but now I am living my dream.\nI didn't realise I would be famous one day but I have so much fun dressing up and wearing beautiful dresses. I did three catwalks at London Fashion Week this year and they were brilliant.\nLooking back at this year, there have been so many good things, but the best bit was probably when my book was published. I was so proud and really excited. I thought, \"Wow it's my own book, I can actually read it.\"\nThis year I have also been filming for a Channel 4 documentary all about my agency, which is going on TV next year, I can't wait to watch it.\nI'm in my last year of performing arts college now and I really want to carry on modelling and acting when I leave. I never get nervous. I'm very confident and very cheeky.\nWhen I did the Vogue shoot, I didn't know if my photo was going to be on the cover. My favourite teachers were there when I found out, I was at college, and I was crying and screaming. My friends said \"we love you\" and \"we are proud of you\" and \"well done\".\nThe first Barbie with Down's syndrome came out earlier this year and they asked me to do a photoshoot. I felt honoured and proud. When I saw the doll I thought \"Oh my god, I love it.\" It was great to see a doll that looks like me.\nMy absolute favourite thing in the world is dancing. One day I would love to be on Strictly Come Dancing. I went to watch it being filmed a few weeks ago, but I didn't want to be in the audience, I wanted to be on the dancefloor!\nI've just bought a new house and I can't wait for Christmas. I love spending time with my nephew who is two and opening lots of presents. I love being his aunty and I give him lots of cuddles.\nI am proving people wrong and I am a role model for people like me. Doctors said I wouldn't talk but now I never stop talking! You should always believe in yourself.\nOne day I want to model in New York on a red carpet and on a catwalk.\nNever give up on your hopes and dreams, be who you are and always be happy. Just go out there and rock it.\nAs told to Charlie Jones, BBC News\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

That will get you through an album alright.\"\nAstley's longevity is part of what is being celebrated this evening - four decades which have seen him transition from tea boy to being Glastonbury's cup of tea.\nIt is slightly galling to realise that even the Rickrolling craze (which introduced him to a whole new generation by tricking people to click on misleading internet links which direct them to the video for his hit Never Gonna Give You Up) is itself 17 years old.  \nNow Astley is following in the musical first-footing footsteps of Robbie Williams, Alicia Keys and Sam Ryder, having been chosen to play the concert shown annually either side of the midnight fireworks on BBC One. Traditionally it attracts one of the biggest TV audiences of the year. \nThis is why Astley has brought in reinforcements. As well as Rylan, tonight's concert will feature a duet with Sharleen Spiteri from Texas.  \n\"I've got to know her through different festivals,\" he explains.\n\"She's jumped up on stage and sung Highway to Hell. She's fearless. She's got some pipes on her that woman, I tell you.\"\nTonight, they will be heard taking on the Motown classic Ain't No Mountain High Enough: \"I like doing covers. It reminds me of being a kid in a band,\" he enthuses. \nCover versions served Sam Ryder very well when he hosted the show last year as he blasted through Taylor Swift, Stevie Wonder and Queen medleys, with that band's guitarist Brian May describing him as \"smashing it\".\nAstley says the first thing he did after being offered the gig was to watch Sam Ryder's programme back: \"He nailed that show. Now I'm beginning to feel the pressure.\"\nAnd his nerves get worse when I point out that the acts who have played at the Roundhouse include Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix and The Doors (\"The Doors? Oh, I did not know that.\") \nThe venue also has a its own history of New Year's Eve gigs. On the 31 December 1966, The Who headlined Psychedelicamania, with support from Pink Floyd. \nBilled as \"a giant New Year's Eve freak-out all-night rave', it culminated with Pete Townsend picking up his guitar like an axe and thrashing his amplifiers with such ferocity that debris hit the audience, leading to a number of very angry letters of complaint appearing in the following week's Melody Maker.  \nAstley will be going for a rather different vibe.\nLess Psychedelicamania, more: \"Turn on. Tune in. Nod off.\"\n\"It's funny, I must say I've not been out on New Year's Eve for a very long time,\" he says. \"Make something nice for dinner, get something nice to drink. See the new year in at home, have the telly on and join in. And I'm hoping people are going to have a good time doing that.\"\nHowever, the atmosphere of the Roundhouse will play a crucial part: \"The thing about this place, is that it is a real venue,\" he says as a huge RICK ASTLEY sign is constructed above the stage.\n\"That was the most important thing to me. The idea of doing a TV show frightens me to death, to be honest. So, we're doing a gig and the BBC are filming it. That's how I'm looking at it.\"\nThe crux of any New Year's Eve show is which song to play first after midnight. When it comes to Rick Astley, I suggest that there is not really much room for manoeuvre. \nThankfully, he laughs in agreement: \"Obviously that song Never Gonna Give You Up has been part of my DNA now for more than 30 years. As mad as people may find the fact that I still enjoy singing it, I still do. I think it kind of solidifies in my own mind how lucky I've been.\"\nIt is a joy to see a singer going misty eyed over their own number one single from 1987.\n\"Some people may think that's a bit corny, but it's been really good to me that song. I never take it for granted. I relish playing it as I know it's my biggest tune.\"\nIt also provided one of the standout moments at this year's Glastonbury Festival, when Rick Astley was the unlikely choice to open the Pyramid stage on the Saturday, on a line up which included Lizzo and Guns N' Roses. Later that same day he reappeared on the Woodies stage to play a set of Smiths cover versions with Blossoms. \n\"I never thought I'd get to play Glastonbury, never mind the Pyramid Stage and the fact that it went so well it was amazing. I just loved every moment of every second.\"\nSo much so, that he plans to return: \"I'd really love to go in 2024, but just as a punter and just go and watch bands, have a glass of wine maybe and just chill out.\"\nAstley has a lot to look forward to in 2024. He has his own arena tour, his own outdoor shows in Cardiff and Halifax, he will be making his Latitude debut and play alongside Liam Gallagher and Calvin Harris at TRANSMT in Glasgow.\nHe laughs when that line-up is mentioned: \"When I look at who is headlining some of the festivals I play, it's not even false modesty. \n\"When I picture myself back being a 21-year-old, doing that Stock Aitken Waterman thing that, let's face it, the whole music media hated. Let's just get that out on the table. I never thought I would be playing festivals at any point in my life with. Even back then, when I was having hits. \n\"The world has just moved into a different place. Things are so much more eclectic in the way that people listen and stream. Everyone listens to everything. And the people in the audience love that. I think that's what a festival is these days.\"\nBefore he heads back to rehearsals there is just time to ask him for his New Year's resolutions: \"I want to get fitter. I'm noticing, as are a few friends of mine who are in my age group, who are performers, writers, producers, but those who get on stage mainly, we're all feeling it a bit,\" he chuckles.\nFittingly, this means that there are a number of things that Astley has decided he is never gonna give up. \n\"I need to get up there on my bike, I think.\n\"Instead of having weights hanging around the house, actually use them. There aren't sore bits. There are just bits that are 57 years old.\"\nRick Astley - ready to roll into 2024.\nRick Astley Rocks New Year's Eve is on BBC One at 23:30, except in Scotland, where Hogmanay will feature music from KT Tunstall.

So what does it mean for next year's general election?\nMr Trump is the clear frontrunner to be the Republican nominee in November 2024 and challenge Joe Biden for the White House. His campaign described both decisions as \"atrocious\" and an \"attempted theft of an election\".\nThe top election official in Maine ruled the former president was ineligible to run because of his actions around the Capitol riot. Colorado's highest court issued a similar, unprecedented, ruling just days earlier.\nBut it is still uncertain whether Mr Trump's name will appear on the ballot when the two states pick their Republican candidate in the coming months, as both rulings are on hold while an appeals process plays out.\nUnlike in Colorado, where the state's Supreme Court ruled on Mr Trump's eligibility, in Maine it was decided by the top electoral official because of a quirk in its constitution.\nSecretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat, issued a 34-page ruling that said Mr Trump must be removed from its Republican primary ballot because of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.\nSection 3 disqualifies people who engage in \"insurrection or rebellion\" from holding federal office.\nHer order said Mr Trump \"over the course of several months and culminating on January 6 2021, used a false narrative of election fraud to inflame his supporters and direct them to the Capitol\".\nMs Bellows, an elected official, was accused of making a politically motivated decision by the Trump campaign. She denied this and said it was \"thorough and based on the rule of law\".\nSpeaking to BBC News after her ruling, Ms Bellows said it was her duty to uphold election laws in her state, and that she hoped the \"Supreme Court will settle this matter nationwide\".\nOn 19 December, the Colorado Supreme Court said it found \"clear and convincing evidence that President Trump engaged in insurrection\".\nIt was the first time Section 3 had been used to disqualify a presidential candidate.\nThe lengthy 213-page ruling said Mr Trump's actions in the build-up to 6 January 2021 did constitute insurrection.\nHis lawyers had argued in Colorado that he should not be disqualified because he did not bear responsibility for the riot.\nThey also noted that Mr Trump has not been charged with inciting insurrection.\nYes. These rulings only apply to Colorado and Maine respectively.\nHours after Maine's ruling, California's elected secretary of state, a Democrat, ignored calls to remove Mr Trump from the state's Republican primary ballot - saying it was a matter for the courts. Michigan's top court this week declined to hear a case seeking to disqualify Mr Trump.\nMr Trump is far ahead of his Republican rivals so can still win his party's nomination without competing in Colorado or Maine.\nIn the US, the two main parties nominate a presidential candidate by holding a series of state primaries and caucuses that begin in January.\nIn terms of the general election, in both states, Joe Biden won against Donald Trump in 2020 by a wide margin, and it is unlikely that Mr Trump will need to win the states to enter the White House once more.\nIt is now likely that the US Supreme Court will intervene to offer a ruling that would apply nationally.\nThat's because the Colorado Republican Party has appealed the state's ruling to the Supreme Court.\nThe top US court will decide whether to take up the case in the new year, but it is not clear when.\nMr Trump's name will remain on the ballot in Colorado until the Supreme Court makes a ruling or, in a less likely outcome, decides not to take up the case.\nThe Maine ruling is also on hold pending a legal appeal in the state's courts. Any decision by the US Supreme Court could supersede this and apply nationally.\nThe US justices will have to consider the legal arguments which will take time, but they will be under pressure to decide before the Colorado and Maine primaries on 5 March, the so-called Super Tuesday when the greatest number of states hold ballots.\nThe balance of that court has shifted to more conservative in recent years, thanks in part to three justices who were appointed by Mr Trump when he was president.\nAlmost everything about the situation is unprecedented, leaving lingering questions about how this may affect the general election.\nMaeva Marcus, the director of the Institute for Constitutional Studies at George Washington University, says the same \"rationale\" behind the Colorado ruling that disqualified Mr Trump from the primary ballot would \"hold for the general election\".\nBut it's too early to say what will happen in the general election in November until the issue works its way through the courts, she said.\nThere are two key legal issues to consider.\nOne is whether Mr Trump's actions in the build-up to the storming of the US Capitol amount to insurrection.\nThe other is whether the office holders that Section 3 was aimed at barring should include the president.\nA lower court in Colorado has already ruled that Mr Trump engaged in insurrection but the law did not apply to the office of the presidency.\nThe Colorado Supreme Court disagreed, and top legal scholars are divided on whether this law should apply to Mr Trump.\nLawyers for Mr Trump dispute that he engaged in insurrection and argue his remarks to supporters on the day of the 2021 riot were protected by his right to free speech.\nMr Trump's campaign said the latest ruling is another example of the justice system being used to persecute him.\nBut there could be wider implications for the general election.\nDozens of other US states have similar lawsuits trying to bar Mr Trump from running, and the decisions in Colorado and Maine could make it more likely some of them succeed.\nIf Mr Trump was stopped from running in a state where he and Mr Biden are neck-and-neck, that could be critical in a presidential race that is expected to be closely fought."}

The front lines have hardly moved in the last few months but could the course of the war change in 2024?\nPresident Volodomyr Zelensky has admitted his country's spring offensive has not been the success he hoped. Russia still controls about 18% of Ukraine.\nWe asked three military analysts how they think events may unfold in the coming 12 months.\nBarbara Zanchetta, Department of War Studies, King's College London\nThe prospects for an end of the war in Ukraine remain bleak. Compared with this time last year, Vladimir Putin is stronger, politically more than militarily.\nThe situation on the battleground remains uncertain. Recently, Ukraine's winter offensive seems to have come to a halt. But there is no Russian breakthrough, either. More than ever, the outcome depends on political decisions made miles away from the centre of the conflict - in Washington and in Brussels.\nThe West's impressive show of unity displayed in 2022, and that endured throughout 2023, is starting to vacillate.\nThe US defence aid package is held hostage by what President Biden rightly labelled \"petty politics\" in Washington. And the future of the EU's economic aid is seemingly dependent on Hungary's incongruous stance.\nHesitation in the West's capitals has emboldened Putin. His recent public appearances and defiant statements demonstrate that as far as he is concerned, Russia is in this for the long haul.\nSo, will the West have the strength and stamina to continue to oppose him and all that he represents?\nThe EU's decision to open membership talks with Ukraine and Moldova is more than just symbolic. It implicitly means continued backing for Kyiv, as a future in the EU for Ukraine would be impossible with a full-blown victory for Russia.\nIn Washington, a complete reversal of policy is unlikely.\nWhile it is tempting to depict doomsday scenarios for US assistance as Trump's ratings rise in the polls, the former president, amid all the theatrics, did not walk out from Nato in 2016. And he would not singlehandedly be able to revolutionise America's 75-year-long transatlantic partnership.\nThis is not to say that the recent cracks in the Western camp are meaningless. For the West, and therefore for Ukraine, 2024 will be more difficult.\nFor democracies, long-term consensus in support for war has always been more complicated than for autocrats with no accountability.\nWhile it is likely that the war will drag on throughout 2024, it cannot drag on indefinitely.\nWith Western hesitancy bolstering Russia, and in the absence of either a coup or a health-related issue leading to Putin's demise, the only foreseeable outcome will be a negotiated settlement that for now both sides continue to refuse.\nMichael Clarke, former director general of the Royal United Services Institute\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 saw the return of major war to the European continent. The course of the conflict in 2023 marked the fact that industrial-age warfare had returned too.\nIndustrial-age warfare bends significant parts, or in some cases whole economies, towards the production of war materials as matters of priority. Russia's defence budget has tripled since 2021 and will consume 30% of government spending next year.\nThis will make the war in Ukraine a longer and more traumatic enterprise than anything Europe has known since the middle of the last century. The coming year will demonstrate whether Russia - and its suppliers in North Korea and Iran - or Ukraine - and its Western backers - are able and prepared to meet the voracious demands of industrial-age warfare.\nIt would be wrong to say that the front lines in Ukraine are stalemated, but both sides are capable of fighting each other to a standstill as they each try to take strategic initiatives.\nRussian forces may try to push again along the entire front, at least to secure all of the Donbas region. Ukraine will probably try to exploit the success it has had in re-establishing its control over the western Black Sea and its vital trade corridor to the Bosphorus.\nAnd Kyiv will likely also try to spring more military surprises on the Russian invaders to knock them off balance in some areas.\nBut in essence, 2024 looks like being a year of consolidation for both Kyiv and Moscow.\nRussia lacks the equipment and trained manpower to launch a strategic offensive until spring 2025, at the earliest.\nMeanwhile, Ukraine needs Western finance and military support to keep it in the war during next year while it, too, builds up its intrinsic strengths to create the conditions for a series of liberating offensives in the future.\nIndustrial-age warfare is a struggle between societies. What happens on the battlefield becomes ultimately only the symptom of that struggle.\nThe military course of this war in 2024 will be determined in Moscow, Kyiv, Washington, Brussels, Beijing, Tehran and Pyongyang more than in Avdiivka, Tokmak, Kramatorsk or any of the devastated battlefields along the frontlines.\nBen Hodges, former commanding general, United States Army Europe\nRussia lacks a decisive, breakthrough capability to overrun Ukraine and will do what it can to hold on to what it currently occupies, using the time to strengthen its defences while it hopes for the West to lose the will to continue supporting Ukraine.\nBut Ukraine will not stop. It is in a fight for its survival and understands what Russia will do if it stops. More European nations are now talking about the need to step up aid in light of concerns that the US is weakening in its resolve.\nI do, however, anticipate that early in the new year the US will rediscover its strategic backbone and pass the aid package that was delayed in Congress in December.\nTherefore, I anticipate Ukraine will do the following in the coming months as it prepares to regain the initiative:\nBy early summer Ukraine will be able to use US-made F16 fighter jets for the first time, which it hopes will improve its ability to counter Russian aircraft and strengthen its own air defences.\nThe most strategically important part of Ukraine that remains occupied by Russia is Crimea, which is what we call the \"decisive terrain\".\nUkraine will do all it can to keep pressure on the Russians there to make it untenable for the Russian navy in Sevastopol, the handful of air force bases there and their logistics base at Dzankoy.\nThey have already proven the concept. With just three UK-provided Storm Shadow cruise missiles, they have forced the commander of the Black Sea Fleet to withdraw a third of his fleet from Sevastopol.\nThe Ukrainians do not have unlimited resources of course, especially artillery ammunition and long-range precision weapons.\nBut the Russian soldiers are in worse shape. War is a test of will, and a test of logistics. The Russian logistics system is fragile and under continuous pressure from Ukraine."}

Thereafter, it was part of the meaning and the symbol of freedom.\"\nThe bongs are now an integral part of BBC Radio 4's daily news bulletins, with the sound heard twice a day, at the start of the 18:00 and midnight news bulletins.\nOn Sundays, the sounds are heard three times over the day.\nThe bells are also broadcast live on special occasions, such as Armistice Day, Christmas Day and New Year's Eve.\nBut there have been some notable exceptions, when the bells have been off air.\nDuring World War Two, unbeknown to the public, the bongs were at times replaced by recorded ones for security reasons.\nThere have also been some freak events, such as in 1976, when the chiming mechanism broke due to metal fatigue, and had to be replaced by pips on Radio 4.\nIn 2017, the bongs were replaced by a recording again. That was due to a major restoration work taking place on the world-famous Elizabeth Tower, which houses the clock, Big Ben, and the four smaller quarter bells.\nThe work - the biggest repair and conservation project in the building's history - meant the exterior was covered in scaffolding and the bell itself was silenced.\nCosts ballooned to Â£80m and the project took a year longer than expected.\n\"It was important in order that we could restore the building for future generations,\" says Charlotte Claughton, senior project leader at the House of Commons.\n\"There was stonework crumbling, also the great clock hadn't had a major overhaul in over 30 years at that point.\"\nMs Claughton said the infrastructure was updated during the works, including bringing in new lighting and microphones.\nThe work has now been completed, and in November, live bongs once again returned to Radio 4's news bulletins.\nAhead of New Year's Eve, extra microphones are brought in to help broadcast the countdown at midnight.\nAnd with people across the country waiting for the sound of 12 chimes signalling the start of 2024, it's a big day for Big Ben's clock mechanics like Andrew Strangeway,\n\"We'll be here on the day, making sure the clock is running precisely to time,\" Mr Strangeway said.\n\"We'll be taking time checks throughout the day and making small adjustments to the pendulum, just to make sure that midnight happens exactly when everyone is expecting it to.\"\nFor more on the 100 year anniversary of Big Ben's bongs on the radio, go to History of the BBC and BBC Oral History Collection."}

It's just that those cells wouldn't be able to reach an egg and fertilise eggs,\"  Prof Barratt said. \nThe team received Â£3.45m ($4.4m) of funding in October from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation\nExisting birth control pills prevent women's ovaries from releasing an egg and contain hormones which often produce side effects that can last months.\n\"It takes about three months to shut that factory down and it clearly doesn't work all the time, and there are some side effects.\n\"And then it takes three months to switch the system back on again,\" Prof Barratt said.\nA non-hormonal pill could take just hours to disable the sperm, while hormonal birth control pills may take a few days to be effective and it would also be reversible within hours, he added.\nOther groups are working on different types of approaches for male contraception but Dundee's approach is unique, Prof Barratt said, and could produce a non-hormonal contraceptive that works in both men and women.\nKeeping the side effects as low as possible is crucial to a wide take-up of the pill by men.\nThe compound his team is working on could also be given to women to block sperm in the female tract.\nThis would offer women a non-hormonal alternative form of birth control, meaning the side effects would be much reduced.\nThe Gates Foundation was keen to explore it in women too, Prof Barratt explained, and his team's approach has always been designed to cover both.\nLarge pharmaceutical companies have historically shown very little interest in the area and \"the safety bar is very high, so they've always been reluctant to get into the subject without somebody showing a bit of progress,\" Prof Barratt said.\nThe work is still in the discovery phase, but he hopes to be able to start clinical trials for safety in the next few years, followed by trials for efficacy in four to five years.\n\"The purpose of the Gates Foundation is largely to show progress,\" he explained.\nBorn and raised in Welshpool, a market town in Powys, Prof Barratt, who now leads the reproductive medicine department at the University of Dundee's School of Medicine, said he still feels \"naturally Welsh\".\n\"I lived in Wales until I was 22, the formative years in college and school. It's just part of me,\" he added.\nHe studied Zoology at Swansea University and obtained a PhD at the University of Birmingham. \nThrough the Gates foundation, his team is part of a global network collaborating with other groups working on different targets. \nWhile it is collaborative, he said his team also needed to be competitive in its quest for progress.\n\"You're competing, but at the same time you're trying to get humanity over the fence. You can't let that stand in the way of progress for humanity,\" he said.\nHis life ambition remains, however, to see Wales comprehensively beat the All Blacks in rugby, live. "}

Because of Austria's Repair Voucher scheme, he will only have to pay 50% of the repair costs to get it fixed.\n\"It's an old laptop, and I'm trying to make it go again, instead of buying a new one,\" he said.\nErik has already used the Repair Bonus to mend an old CD player, which is now working well. He says the scheme makes it easier to decide whether or not to throw something away.\n\"Yeah, it helps, because usually handcraft and people fixing things is much more expensive than buying a new one. This way, things can be saved.\"\nAt the back of the workshop, Lukas, a technician, checks out the motherboard of an old laptop. Around him are stacks of boxes full of computers and phones which have been brought to be mended.\nHelferline's chief executive, Clemens Schmidgruber, says the Repair Bonus scheme has been great for his business.\n\"Our revenues have doubled since it was introduced. So we're very happy about it,\" he said.\n\"It is a real win-win situation for customers, for local businesses and of course for the environment.\n\"Customers benefit because it helps them save a lot of money. Of course, it's good for local businesses because they generate additional revenues. And the environment benefits, because there's less electronic waste.\"\nMr Schmidgruber says customers have to download a voucher from a government website and then pay the repair shop upfront. \"Then you get back half of the costs after three to four weeks.\"\nThe Austrian government's repair voucher system, which is financed through the Covid Recovery Fund, is just for electrical appliances.\nBut the City of Vienna runs a separate scheme - which works in a similar way and helps people pay for repairs to old clothes, bicycles or furniture.\nMarkus Piringer, the co-ordinator of the Repair Network in Vienna, says \"if the costs of the repair are more than 20-30% of the cost of the new product, people tend to buy new. And as the Repair Bonus lowers those costs, it's a big incentive to repair more.\"\nBut he says the financial aspect of repair, while very important, is just one part of the picture.\n\"Another very important point is that the products have to be repairable. So, we [need to] work on this at European Union level and more effort needs to be taken to really get things going there.\"\nMarkus says it's all about changing policies and mindsets.\n\"For many people, it's still very positive to have always the newest product and to throw away your clothing after half a year or even less. And so this is also something where we need awareness raising.\"\nAnd he warned that while the number of repairs was rising in Austria because of the voucher schemes, there were still too few technicians and craftspeople to do it. \"We have a problem that we don't have enough repairers. So we also need a system which is promoting repairs as a job.

It also served as a distraction from anger at the rising price of eggs.\nRussian rapper Vacio, whose single-sock outfit led to his arrest, has since been handed a 15-day jail term for \"disorderly conduct\". Otherwise known as Nikolai Vasiliev, he was found guilty of promoting \"non-traditional sexual relations\" and handed a fine twice that of Ivleeva's.\nIn the words of BBC Russia Editor Steve Rosenberg, pro-Kremlin bloggers, MPs and activists, who supported the war, were furious. \"How could celebrities be out partying like this while Russian soldiers were putting their lives on the line in the 'special military operation'?\"\n\"Our soldiers on the front line are definitely not fighting for this,\" said pro-censorship activist Yekaterina Mizulina, who runs Russia's League for a Safe Internet.\nMore from Steve Rosenberg: Moral backlash for guests of Ivleeva's 'almost naked' party\nOther guests have been punished in different ways, with concerts or sponsorship contracts cancelled. Some are said to have been removed from Channel One's glitzy pre-recorded New Year's Eve TV show, which many Russians may now watch to spot who has been edited out.\nVeteran singer Lolita Milyavskaya says her gigs are being cancelled and she is being \"cut out of television\". Anastasia Ivleeva herself has seen her face vanish from mobile firm MTS's advertising campaign and her business is facing an audit from the tax service.\nFormer Eurovision singer Dima Bilan and TV presenter Ksenia Sobchak have said sorry too.\nSo-called king of Russian pop Philipp Kirkorov was as profuse in his apology to the public as any of his fellow guests, saying simply: \"There are moments in everyone's life when you walk through the wrong door.\"\nWidely regarded as President Vladimir Putin's favourite singer, Kirkorov appealed for his \"mistake\" not to affect his career in \"Russia, the only country I exist in as an artist and as a citizen\".\nSuggestions that he might be deprived of his \"Order of Honour\" appear to be false, but he has been removed from a poster for a New Year's Eve TV film called \"Ivan Vasilievech changes everything\".\nThe remake of a popular old Soviet-era film features Kirkorov as Peter the Great and the TV channel director has said some of the scenes are being re-shot before it airs.\nThe Kremlin has, meanwhile, distanced itself from the outcry. \"Let you and I be the only ones in the country who aren't discussing this topic,\" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters."}

It was a great experience. \n\"We wanted to do it with our daughter in her gap year - see the world.\"\nThe family thinks they have used five times less carbon travelling than if they had flown all the way. \nMs Coggins said the wedding \"was so beautiful\" and their journey there was \"a fantastic way to meet people and see the world\". \n\"Our mum died when we were young, so we've been really close, so it was really important to get here. \n\"So I'm flipping glad we did.\" \nMs Coggins and Mr Simon both gave up their jobs to make the journey with their daughter, which they said required a \"monumental amount\" of planning. \nThey said they learnt how to say \"thank you\" and \"sorry\" in every language and added that people always stepped up to help them whatever country they were in.  \nFollow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.

It's just that those cells wouldn't be able to reach an egg and fertilise eggs,\"  Prof Barratt said. \nThe team received Â£3.45m ($4.4m) of funding in October from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation\nExisting birth control pills prevent women's ovaries from releasing an egg and contain hormones which often produce side effects that can last months.\n\"It takes about three months to shut that factory down and it clearly doesn't work all the time, and there are some side effects.\n\"And then it takes three months to switch the system back on again,\" Prof Barratt said.\nA non-hormonal pill could take just hours to disable the sperm, while hormonal birth control pills may take a few days to be effective and it would also be reversible within hours, he added.\nOther groups are working on different types of approaches for male contraception but Dundee's approach is unique, Prof Barratt said, and could produce a non-hormonal contraceptive that works in both men and women.\nKeeping the side effects as low as possible is crucial to a wide take-up of the pill by men.\nThe compound his team is working on could also be given to women to block sperm in the female tract.\nThis would offer women a non-hormonal alternative form of birth control, meaning the side effects would be much reduced.\nThe Gates Foundation was keen to explore it in women too, Prof Barratt explained, and his team's approach has always been designed to cover both.\nLarge pharmaceutical companies have historically shown very little interest in the area and \"the safety bar is very high, so they've always been reluctant to get into the subject without somebody showing a bit of progress,\" Prof Barratt said.\nThe work is still in the discovery phase, but he hopes to be able to start clinical trials for safety in the next few years, followed by trials for efficacy in four to five years.\n\"The purpose of the Gates Foundation is largely to show progress,\" he explained.\nBorn and raised in Welshpool, a market town in Powys, Prof Barratt, who now leads the reproductive medicine department at the University of Dundee's School of Medicine, said he still feels \"naturally Welsh\".\n\"I lived in Wales until I was 22, the formative years in college and school. It's just part of me,\" he added.\nHe studied Zoology at Swansea University and obtained a PhD at the University of Birmingham. \nThrough the Gates foundation, his team is part of a global network collaborating with other groups working on different targets. \nWhile it is collaborative, he said his team also needed to be competitive in its quest for progress.\n\"You're competing, but at the same time you're trying to get humanity over the fence. You can't let that stand in the way of progress for humanity,\" he said.\nHis life ambition remains, however, to see Wales comprehensively beat the All Blacks in rugby, live. "}

Because of Austria's Repair Voucher scheme, he will only have to pay 50% of the repair costs to get it fixed.\n\"It's an old laptop, and I'm trying to make it go again, instead of buying a new one,\" he said.\nErik has already used the Repair Bonus to mend an old CD player, which is now working well. He says the scheme makes it easier to decide whether or not to throw something away.\n\"Yeah, it helps, because usually handcraft and people fixing things is much more expensive than buying a new one. This way, things can be saved.\"\nAt the back of the workshop, Lukas, a technician, checks out the motherboard of an old laptop. Around him are stacks of boxes full of computers and phones which have been brought to be mended.\nHelferline's chief executive, Clemens Schmidgruber, says the Repair Bonus scheme has been great for his business.\n\"Our revenues have doubled since it was introduced. So we're very happy about it,\" he said.\n\"It is a real win-win situation for customers, for local businesses and of course for the environment.\n\"Customers benefit because it helps them save a lot of money. Of course, it's good for local businesses because they generate additional revenues. And the environment benefits, because there's less electronic waste.\"\nMr Schmidgruber says customers have to download a voucher from a government website and then pay the repair shop upfront. \"Then you get back half of the costs after three to four weeks.\"\nThe Austrian government's repair voucher system, which is financed through the Covid Recovery Fund, is just for electrical appliances.\nBut the City of Vienna runs a separate scheme - which works in a similar way and helps people pay for repairs to old clothes, bicycles or furniture.\nMarkus Piringer, the co-ordinator of the Repair Network in Vienna, says \"if the costs of the repair are more than 20-30% of the cost of the new product, people tend to buy new. And as the Repair Bonus lowers those costs, it's a big incentive to repair more.\"\nBut he says the financial aspect of repair, while very important, is just one part of the picture.\n\"Another very important point is that the products have to be repairable. So, we [need to] work on this at European Union level and more effort needs to be taken to really get things going there.\"\nMarkus says it's all about changing policies and mindsets.\n\"For many people, it's still very positive to have always the newest product and to throw away your clothing after half a year or even less. And so this is also something where we need awareness raising.\"\nAnd he warned that while the number of repairs was rising in Austria because of the voucher schemes, there were still too few technicians and craftspeople to do it. \"We have a problem that we don't have enough repairers. So we also need a system which is promoting repairs as a job. We are working on this at the moment.\"\nAt his bicycle shop in Vienna, Marc Warnaar and his team are fixing a bike, which has rusted brake and gear cables.\n\"They don't make spare parts for this gear system,\" he says, \"Especially the gear cables, you cannot buy them anymore.

The BBC is not able to verify the Russian claims that Czech ammunition was used.\nDuring the meeting, Russia's envoy to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, accused Ukraine of carrying out a \"deliberate, indiscriminate attack against a civilian target\".\nHis remarks were promptly refuted by Ukraine's allies, with the French envoy saying that Ukraine was defending itself under UN laws, while others including the US and UK said President Vladimir Putin was responsible for Russian deaths by starting the conflict.\nThe UN assistant secretary-general, Mohamed Khiari, \"unequivocally condemned\" the attacks on both sides and said strikes against civilians and civilian infrastructure \"violate international humanitarian law, are unacceptable and must end now\".\nVideo from one of the strikes - which the BBC has verified but chosen not to share - shows a pile-up of cars, some of which are on fire, and at least one person lying motionless on the road.\nThe sound of loud bangs and car horns can be heard throughout. Before thick black smoke obscures the scene, someone is seen running to assist the person lying on the road.\n\"Today, shelling by the armed forces of Ukraine has had the most severe consequences of the last two years,\" Belgorod's regional governor wrote in a Telegram post.\nThe Russian defence ministry said Kyiv was \"trying to distract attention from defeats at the front, and is also wanting to provoke us\".\nThe statement added: \"This crime will not go unpunished.\"\nLate on Saturday, the governor of Ukraine's Kherson region said one person had been killed during Russian shelling of a residential building.\nAt the same time, Russian strikes injured 19 in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the local government reported.\nRussia launched six rocket attacks on the city, the head of Kharkiv's regional administration said. He added that two children and a foreign national were among those injured.\nThe Russian defence ministry earlier said 13 missiles had been destroyed over the wider Belgorod region - and 32 drones had been shot down in the Bryansk, Oryol, Kursk and Moscow regions.\nThe Bryansk governor said two villages were targeted and a child had been killed.\nUkrainian media - citing intelligence sources - reported that a group of drones hit an electronics factory in that same region, saying the facility had been used to make Russian military equipment.\nMoscow has repeatedly accused Ukraine of being behind drone strikes in recent months. Kyiv rarely admits to such attacks across the border, although it has carried out strikes like this before.\nRussia's massive bombardment of Ukraine on Friday killed 39 people and injured nearly 160, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Several cities were hit, including the capital, Kyiv.\nMayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitchsko said at least 16 people were killed in the city - making Friday the deadliest day so far for civilians in the capital.\nAn emergency meeting of the UN Security Council that same evening overwhelmingly condemned Russia's renewed mass-bombing campaign in Ukraine and said attacks had to stop \"immediately\".\nCountries including the US, UK and France said hitting civilian infrastructure had violated the international rules of war.\n\"Rather than peace, Putin chose to mark this holiday season... with an unprecedented number of drone and missile attacks,\" US representative to the UN John Kelly said.\nRussia said Ukrainian air defences were to blame for causing damage to civilian buildings."}

As the rain lashed down the boat pulled over and they took shelter under a tin shed on the riverbank, when they were hit.\nBangladesh, which is blighted by extreme weather and heavy storms, suffers an average of 300 deaths by lightning every year, according to the UN. \nThat's compared with fewer than 20 annually in the United States, which has almost double the population.\nIt's a heavy burden for the South Asian nation, and for many like Mamun, who is speaking for the first time about what happened on that day in August 2021.\nThe 21-year-old was getting ready at his in-laws' home in the Shibganj area in the country's north-west, when he heard the crackle of thunder, minutes before he got the gut-wrenching news.\nHe rushed to his family, where he was confronted with a scene of chaos and confusion.\n\"Some people were hugging the bodies,\" Mamun recalls, \"the injured were crying out in painâ€¦ children were screaming. I was at a loss. I could not even decide who I should go to first.\"\nMamun lost his father, grandparents, cousins, uncles and aunts. His mother wasn't on the boat and survived the lightning attack.\n\"When I found my father's dead body I simply burst into tears. I was so shocked I fell sick,\" Mamun says.\nLater that evening, the funerals of his relatives took place - the wedding feast they were meant to enjoy was instead distributed to the homeless.\nMamun later got married, but says he doesn't celebrate his wedding anniversary as it triggers painful memories. \"After the tragic incident, now I am really scared of rain and thunder.\"\nLightning is a big killer in Bangladesh, claiming more lives annually than floods. \nThe number of reported deaths due to lightning has also risen steeply, from just dozens per year in the 1990s. \nNasa, the UN and the government of Bangladesh cite increased storminess due to climate change as a reason for the increase in deadly strikes.\n\"Global warming, environmental changes, living patterns are all factors for the increasing death toll due to lightning,\" Md Mijanur Rahman, the director general of Bangladesh's disaster management division, told the BBC.\nSuch is the seriousness, that the government has added lightning strikes to the official list of natural disasters the country faces which includes floods, cyclones, earthquakes and droughts.\nThe majority of victims of lightning are farmers, who are vulnerable to the elements as they work the fields through the rainy monsoon months in the spring and summer.\nA football shirt, hanging on a rickety fence, overlooking a field in the Satkhira region of Bangladesh is a poignant reminder of one of the victims. \nJust days earlier, the shirt had been worn by Abdullah as he went into the vast rice fields to do his day's work.\nNow, draped over the wooden barrier, the Barcelona football shirt is singed and frayed, the burnt edges of thread show where the lightning left its mark in May this year.\nAbdullah's wife of three decades, Rehana, took me to the field to tell me what happened the day she lost her husband.\nIt was bright and sunny as Abdullah and a group of farmers went to harvest rice. By late afternoon a heavy storm began, and a lightning bolt struck her husband.\n\"Some of the other farmers brought him to this roadside shop,\" Rehana says, pointing to a small shack along the lane. \"By then he was already dead.\"\nBack at Rehana's house, the rice Abdullah harvested a day earlier lies in fresh piles outside the small one-room dwelling.\nThe couple had recently taken out a loan to build a second room to extend their modest home.\nInside, the couple's 14-year-old son Masood is reading a book. With no primary earner, Rehana fears she will be left with a lifetime of debt and wonders how she will pay for his studies.\n\"The fear gripped me so deeply that now if I see a cloud in the sky, I don't even dare to let my son go outside any more,\" she says consumed by tears.\nLightning is a growing concern in other countries too - including neighbouring India which has also seen a rise in the number of strikes in recent years, but a significant reduction in the number of fatalities due to a number of initiatives. \nThere are efforts in Bangladesh to do more to reduce the number of deaths due to lightning.\nActivists say more tall trees need to be planted in remote rural areas to absorb the impact of the strikes, especially in places which have borne the brunt of deforestation.\nThey also call for a large-scale programme to build lightning sheds, so farmers can take safe shelter, and for broader early warning systems to alert people about possible storms.\nOne challenge is the poor connectivity and lack of mobile usage in the areas where people are the most vulnerable.\nA lack of awareness is also a challenge. Many in the country don't realise how dangerous lightning can be - few people anywhere in the world expect to be hit by a thunderbolt.\nFarmer Ripon Hossen - who was with Abdullah the day he was killed - never imagined what lightning would look like up close, until it struck.\n\"There was a big loud sound, and then I saw lots of flashing lights,\" he recalled. \"It was as if a disk of fire had fallen on us. I felt a great electric shock and fell to the ground. \n\"After a while, I opened my eyes and saw that Abdullah was dead.\"\nRipon can't believe he survived. He says he's terrified to work in the open, but in this impoverished agricultural area farming is the only source of income for him.\n\"I cry whenever I think of my friend Abdullah,\" he says.\n\"When I close my eyes at night, all the memories of that day return like a flashback. I can't console myself.\"\nAdditional reporting/stills - Neha Sharma, Aamir Peerzada, Salman Saeed, Tarekuzzaman Shimul"}

Made every actor better.\n\"He was the epitome of elegance and he will be dearly missed by all of us.\"\nWith more than 130 film and TV credits in total, Wilkinson was as comfortable in period dramas like 1995's Sense and Sensibility and 2013's Belle, as he was playing criminal masterminds in movies like Rush Hour opposite Jackie Chan in 1998, or Guy Ritchie's RocknRolla in 2008.\nHe also earned an Emmy for playing US political figure Benjamin Franklin in 2008 mini-series John Adams and an Emmy nomination as John F Kennedy's father Joe in The Kennedys. He played President Lyndon B Johnson in 2014's Selma, and appeared in The Grand Budapest Hotel and Girl with a Pearl Earring.\nHis death on Saturday was confirmed in a statement shared by his agent on behalf of his family.\nWilkinson was, according to the Encyclopaedia of British Film, \"a major character star, with a remarkable gift - one among several - for conveying inner pain\".\nRobert Carlyle, who starred alongside Wilkinson in The Full Monty, described him, as \"a huge performer, a real titan of an actor, one of the greats of not only his, but of any generation.\"\nIn a tribute on X, formerly Twitter, British actor Phil Davis called him \"powerful and delicate and hugely intelligent - one of the very best\", while singer and actor Will Young described him as \"British acting royalty\".\nUS film maker Scott Derrickson said Wilkinson was \"an amazing talent\" and recalled a time when the actor gave him a surprise kiss on the lips on the set of The Exorcism of Emily Rose.\nBorn in Leeds before moving to Canada and then Cornwall in childhood, he found his calling at the age of 18 when he was asked to direct a play.\n\"For the first time in my life, I started doing something I knew how to do,\" he said.\n\"I realised it wasn't necessarily just these southern middle-class types that got to be actors; it could possibly be people like me. And once I knew, I never changed my mind.\"\nHe trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) before following the well-worn path to theatre and television work. In 1986, he got his first major screen role in mini-series First Among Equals, based on Jeffrey Archer's best-selling novel.\nPlaying alongside him was Diana Hardcastle. The couple married in 1988, and also went on to play husband and wife in The Kennedys in 2011, and in 2014 action film Good People. The couple had two daughters, Alice and Molly.\nWhen he portrayed Pecksniff in Martin Chuzzlewit for the BBC in 1994, Wilkinson said: \"I looked at it and I thought, I can't get it any better than that. It came out exactly as I meant it to come out. It won a couple of prizes and I thought, I can act, there's no question.\"\nThree years later, he was cast as a former factory foreman who joins fellow unemployed workmates in staging a strip show in The Full Monty.\n\"I was simultaneously offered the lead in a TV series and a possible part in a low-budget movie,\" he told The Guardian.\n\"I remember phoning a friend and he said, 'Take the TV, take the TV'. But I didn't follow his advice, and the TV turned out to be crap.\"\nThe low-budget movie, meanwhile, turned out to be the highest-grossing British film up to that point, and took his career to a new level on both sides of the Atlantic.\nWilkinson received high critical acclaim for Todd Field's 2001 US domestic drama In the Bedroom, in which he played a bereaved father. He was nominated for an Oscar for best actor.\nHe hoped the film would do two things for him, he later said. \"One, [prove] I could play the lead role in a movie. Two, I could play an American lead role. And it did both of those things.\"\nThe actor earned his second Academy Award nomination for his supporting role in Tony Gilroy's 2007 legal thriller Michael Clayton, starring George Clooney.\nWilkinson's other credits included Batman Begins, The Patriot, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Gathering Storm, Black Knight, Valkyrie, The Lone Ranger and Denial.\nHe also provided the voice of the fox in the TV adaptation of children's best-seller The Gruffalo.\nHis long term agent Lou Coulson has described him in interviews as \"one of the best\".\nOff screen, Wilkinson was known for being down-to-earth and keeping a relatively low profile. He said in an interview: \"I like to go to Waitrose and not be recognised.\"\nIn the 2005 New Year Honours, Wilkinson was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to drama."}

Numbers of visitors are expected to exceed pre-pandemic levels in the coming years.\nEarlier this year Unesco said the city should be added to a list of world heritage sites in danger, as the impact of climate change and mass tourism threaten to cause irreversible changes to it.\nIn 2021, large cruise ships were banned from entering the historic centre of Venice via the Giudecca canal after a ship crashed into a harbour. Critics had also argued that the ships were causing pollution and eroding the foundations of the city, which suffers from regular flooding."}

Ellie went on to make history as the first model with the condition to feature on the front cover of Vogue.\nNow aged 22, she has just bought her own home in Essex and recently published a book about her life, called Against All Odds.\nHere, in their own words, the model and her mother Yvonne explain how Ellie has been defying expectations since the day she was born.\nWhen Ellie was born, we were shocked to learn she had Down's syndrome. The doctors said she would never walk or talk and a nurse suggested we might want to leave her at the hospital. I struggled to accept her diagnosis and bond with her.\nWe were told Ellie needed heart surgery so I was really nervous about getting close to her. When she was five months old, she had a 10-hour operation to close holes in her heart. She spent 10 days in intensive care and another week in the high dependency unit.\nAfter three weeks, we were able to take her home and her cheeky and determined personality began to shine through. My husband and I decided to bring her up as Ellie first and put the fact that she has got Down's syndrome to one side.\nDespite what the doctors said, she could walk by 18 months, was speaking by her third birthday and was able to read by the time she started school. Ellie stayed in mainstream education until it came to doing her exams and we moved her to a specialist school.\nWhen she was a teenager, we decided to tell Ellie that she had Down's syndrome. We were nervous about her reaction and showed her a special book but she kept saying, \"I don't look like that. I'm me.\" I was worried it would knock her confidence, but it didn't.\nOne day my friend told me about a new talent agency called Zebedee, which wanted to work with people with disabilities and visible differences, so I decided to apply for Ellie.\nNot long after joining, Ellie was chosen to star in Superdrug's Christmas advert in 2018. Her career really took off from there. My mum always used to say, \"She's definitely going to be someone one day.\" She is very headstrong and feisty but that's what makes her Ellie.\nEllie still really shocks me, she just loves the camera and the attention, I can just see how much she enjoys it and loves it and that makes it all worthwhile.\nEllie recently bought her own home with the proceeds from her modelling but we don't know if she will ever be able to live alone. We are living alongside her for now, though we have kept our family home, and we are trying to encourage her to be more independent but she is still very vulnerable.\nWe have to prepare her for how she will cope one day when we're not around. Her older sister Amy will obviously look out for her but we would never put that full responsibility on her.\nI hope attitudes towards Down's syndrome have changed since Ellie was born but there is still a lot of ignorance. Often in the street, people ask me questions about Ellie and don't address her. They don't realise she can talk and how big a personality she has.\nI always wanted to be a model but I didn't see anyone who looked like me on magazine covers so I wasn't sure if I could do it but now I am living my dream.\nI didn't realise I would be famous one day but I have so much fun dressing up and wearing beautiful dresses. I did three catwalks at London Fashion Week this year and they were brilliant.\nLooking back at this year, there have been so many good things, but the best bit was probably when my book was published. I was so proud and really excited. I thought, \"Wow it's my own book, I can actually read it.\"\nThis year I have also been filming for a Channel 4 documentary all about my agency, which is going on TV next year, I can't wait to watch it.\nI'm in my last year of performing arts college now and I really want to carry on modelling and acting when I leave. I never get nervous. I'm very confident and very cheeky.\nWhen I did the Vogue shoot, I didn't know if my photo was going to be on the cover. My favourite teachers were there when I found out, I was at college, and I was crying and screaming. My friends said \"we love you\" and \"we are proud of you\" and \"well done\".\nThe first Barbie with Down's syndrome came out earlier this year and they asked me to do a photoshoot. I felt honoured and proud. When I saw the doll I thought \"Oh my god, I love it.\" It was great to see a doll that looks like me.\nMy absolute favourite thing in the world is dancing. One day I would love to be on Strictly Come Dancing. I went to watch it being filmed a few weeks ago, but I didn't want to be in the audience, I wanted to be on the dancefloor!\nI've just bought a new house and I can't wait for Christmas. I love spending time with my nephew who is two and opening lots of presents. I love being his aunty and I give him lots of cuddles.\nI am proving people wrong and I am a role model for people like me. Doctors said I wouldn't talk but now I never stop talking! You should always believe in yourself.\nOne day I want to model in New York on a red carpet and on a catwalk.\nNever give up on your hopes and dreams, be who you are and always be happy. Just go out there and rock it.\nAs told to Charlie Jones, BBC News\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

It's pretty cool. It all comes full circle.\"\nSpeaking on Friday, he called Thursday \"one of the best days in my lifetime for sure\".\nOn his third wave of the day, he fired into the barrel of a massive collapsing wall of water.\n\"It was an honour. And just to get barrelled is a whole other realm of victory,\" he says with a triumphant laugh. \n\"So I'm pretty happy about it.\"\nForecasters have issued warnings of more danger ahead after a rogue wave swept pedestrians off their feet and swamped a hotel in Ventura.\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) warned of \"extremely dangerous conditions.\" \n\"Powerful waves and life-threatening rip currents pose an exceptional risk of ocean drowning and damage to coastal structures.\"\nThe NWS said there is \"an increased risk for ocean drowning\" due to rip currents.\nMore swells are in the forecast for Mavericks, located near the city of Half Moon Bay. \nBut only the world's top professionals should consider getting into the ocean during this El NiÃ±o-driven weather event. \n\"Mavericks is kind of the biggest of the big here on the West Coast,\" Mr Cuvelier said. \"But I don't think any beginner or even intermediate surfers should really be surfing anywhere in California (in these conditions).\""}
