Budgeting for retirement involves estimating your post-retirement income and calculating your essential and discretionary expenses. This approach helps you to avoid financial pitfalls and increases the chances your golden years will be enjoyable and worry-free. Here are practical, step-by-step instructions to create an effective retirement budget. Discussing your situation and objectives with a financial advisor will let you create a viable plan for a comfortable retirement.While budgeting always involves some uncertainty, one hard-and-fast rule is that your post-retirement spending plan must not exceed your post-retirement income. For most couples, Social Security will be an important part of that income. Many will also have income from investments and, less commonly, corporate or public pension benefits, annuities and part-time employment. Estimating income can be fairly straightforward, as shown in this example:In 2023, the average retired worker got about $1,800 a month in Social Security retirement benefits. For a couple with similar earnings histories, that makes a total of $3,600 a month or $43,200 a year.The average retirement savings for a person about to retire are approximately, $225,000, equal to $450,000 combined for a couple that has saved equally. Following the conservative rule of thumb and withdrawing 4% a year will provide this couple with another $1,500 monthly or $18,000 a year.Combining these two sources of income gives this average couple a total of $5,100 per month or $61,200 in retirement income per year. Both amounts will be adjusted annually to reflect inflation and Social Security benefits will last their lifetimes, while their investment portfolio can reliably be expected to sustain withdrawals for about 30 years or more.Now let’s turn our attention to expenses. The most accurate way to do this is by looking at your own spending patterns as you approach retirement.Start with housing, which is the largest single expense for most people and likely to account for a third of the total. Add up your total expenses for the last year for rent if you are a tenant or mortgage principal and interest if you own your home but still have a loan Also include insurance premiums, property taxes, maintenance and homeowner’s association fees.Food generally is the next-biggest category for retiree spending. Include grocery bills as well as costs for dining out and having prepared meals delivered. Other important retirement spending types include healthcare, utilities, transportation and discretionary outlays for travel, entertainment and the like.You can make this task much faster, easier and more accurate if you use an online personal finance tool that tracks your spending and helps you make a budget. Otherwise, get the information for your totals from bank and credit card statements, mortgage statements, leases and other records.If your recent expenses total less than your anticipated retirement income, that will give you confidence you’ll be financially secure after you stop working. Otherwise, you may need to reduce expenses or boost income.The most effective way to reduce expenses is by downsizing to a smaller residence and perhaps also relocating to a less costly area. You can increase income by delaying retirement, which lets you save more and also increases your Social Security benefit or by working part-time. Paying down debts, especially mortgages can also reduce costs.Let’s see how this would work for two hypothetical couples. One will be for the average income described above and the other example will be a higher-income couple. The amounts approximate percentages from a 2022 survey of actual retiree spending by the Employee Benefit and Research Institute:At $5,100 per month here’s how a retirement budget might look:$1,500 for housing$1,000 for food$750 for healthcare$750 for transportation$500 for discretionary expenses$500 for other expenses such as clothingThis total comes in at $5,000. While that is less than the $5,100 in budgeted income, it doesn’t account for the unexpected. This couple might do well to look at trimming costs, perhaps by downsizing or reducing discretionary expenses, so their budgeted spending is further below their budgeted income.Another hypothetical couple has $100,000 in income due to higher Social Security benefits, a larger portfolio of investments and generous corporate pensions. Their expenses are likely to break down similarly in terms of percentages, producing a budget that looks like this:$2,500 for housing$1,500 for food$1,200 for healthcare$1,200 for transportation$800 for discretionary expenses$800 for other expenses such as clothingThis total comes to $8,000 per month. Again, that’s just slightly under the anticipated $8,333 in monthly income. Like the first, this couple would also do well to consider adjusting either spending or income to provide a cushion.These are hypothetical examples and a real couple’s experience could be quite different. EBRI found most individual retirees spend less than $2,000 a month, for example. Black, Hispanic and low-income retirees are more likely to be pressured than others, EBRI also found, Finally, asset management firm BlackRock surveyed retirees across all income levels and found 80% were not drawing down their savings at all and the savings of almost a third of those who had already retired were still growing. Your mileage, as the saying goes, may vary.Developing an idea of what will be a good retirement income can help you plan effectively and ensure you can cover your basic expenses comfortably. Averages and rules of thumb can get you started, but individual circumstances vary so much that the smartest way is to collect your own information and generate a custom plan reflecting your personal situation. By carefully assessing your post-retirement income, identifying essential and discretionary expenses and making necessary adjustments, you can help ensure your long-term financial security.A financial advisor can provide personalized strategies and expert insights to help you navigate complex aspects of retirement planning such as income projections, tax implications and investment management.

More recently, Ackman made a $200 million profit when he closed his position in 30-year U.S. Treasuries in October.While Ackman has earned millions by timing the markets perfectly, he also enjoys a steady inflow of dividend income. He has emphasized the benefit of investing in large-cap industry leaders, which are \"simple, predictable, free-cash-flow generative, dominant companies with, as Warren Buffett would say, a moat around them.\"Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here are three high-yield investments to add significant income to your portfolio.As of Dec. 2, he has eight companies in his portfolio that generate $97 million in dividend income. All of his dividend income comes from four stocks.Take a closer look at the dividend-paying stocks Ackman has invested in.Based in Canada, Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR) is one of the world's largest fast-food chain operators. Its brands include Tim Hortons Inc., Burger King Corp., Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen Inc. and Firehouse Subs.Ackman owns 23.35 million shares of Restaurant Brands valued at approximately $1.56 billion. Restaurant Brands, which pays $2.20 per share in dividends annually, generates dividend income of $51.37 million for Ackman's portfolio. Income generated from Restaurant Brands' total dividend payouts accounts for over 52% of Ackman's portfolio dividend income.Ackman touts Restaurant Brands' strong financials and balance sheet as key factors to consider before investing in a company. Restaurant Brands' consolidated systemwide sales rose 10.9% year over year to $11.2 billion for the third quarter that ended Sept. 30. The company also returned over $360 million of capital to shareholders in the last quarter, making it a top pick for income investors.Ranked No. 39 on the Fortune 500 list, Lowe's Companies Inc. (NYSE:LOW) is one of the most prominent home improvement retail chains operating in the U.S. It has more than 1,700 stores across the country.Pershing Square owns 7.07 million shares of Lowe's, valued at over $1.4 billion. The company pays a dividend of $4.40 per share annually, generating nearly $31.1 million in dividend income for Ackman's portfolio. While Lowe's shares have risen by 4.5% year to date, lagging the benchmark S&P 500 index's 19.4% returns, its high dividend payout makes it an attractive investment option.As the travel industry has delivered an impressive rebound in the post-pandemic era, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) has generated significant returns for Ackman.His total investments in Hilton reaped $6.18 million in dividends, accounting for over 6% of his total dividend income. Ackman owns 10.31 million shares of Hilton, valued at over $1.5 billion.Ackman's investment in Hilton has also boosted his total portfolio value, as the stock has risen by nearly 35% this year. Hilton's impressive financials and expansion plans are major drivers behind the bullish outlook.In the third quarter, Hilton's revenue per available room (RevPAR) rose by 6.8% year over year. In addition, the company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) amounted to $1.67 in the last quarter, reflecting a 27% rise from the same period last year. For the full year 2023, the company expects its comparable RevPAR to rise between 12% and 12.5%.Canadian Pacific Kansas City Ltd. (NYSE:CP) operates the first and only single-line transnational railway connecting the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Ackman owns 15.1 million shares of the company, with his total investment valued at over $1.1 million.Canadian Pacific pays $0.56 in dividends annually. However, given Ackman's sizable investment in the railway company, his total dividend income from his stake in Canadian Pacific amounts to nearly $8.5 million.\"Despite CPKC's attractive long-term earnings outlook, the stock continues to trade at a discount to our view of intrinsic value and its closest peer, Canadian National. We believe the magnitude of synergies is larger and the path for realization is longer than investors originally anticipated, providing CPKC with profitable long-term growth and catalyzing share price appreciation in the years to come,\" Ackman said in Pershing Square's 2023 Interim Report.Elon Musk may be adding landlord to his list of titles.

But how much can a retired person earn without paying taxes? The answer to this question varies based on your situation. Understanding the tax rules surrounding retiree income can help avoid an expensive surprise when tax time rolls around. If you need help sorting through the details of your situation, try using SmartAsset’s free financial advisor matching tool.When Does a Retiree’s Income Trigger Taxes?Retirees who are still working likely have at least two streams of income: Social Security benefits and a paycheck from a job. The Social Security benefits you receive can be taxable if 50% of your benefits, plus all of your other income, is greater than the specific limits for your filing status. These amounts are as follows:Single filers, qualifying widowers and heads of households bringing in more than $25,000, based on the math above, may have to pay taxes on their Social Security benefits.Married couples filing separately that have lived apart for an entire year who bring in more than $25,000, based on the math above, may have to pay taxes on their Social Security benefits.A married couple filing jointly bringing in more than $32,000, based on the math above, may have to pay taxes on their Social Security benefits.With that, the benefits you receive may or may not be taxable based on your other income. For example, let’s say that you are a single filer that received $20,000 in Social Security benefits. Additionally, you earned $20,000 at a part-time job. When you run the numbers, 50% of your benefits plus your other income would be $30,000. With that, Uncle Sam would require you to pay federal taxes on a portion of your Social Security benefits.As another example, let’s say a married couple filing jointly receives Social Security benefits of $20,000. You also bring in $20,000 through other sources. With that, 50% of your benefits plus your other income would be $30,000. That’s less than the base amount for married couples filing jointly. So, you wouldn’t have to pay federal income tax on any of your Social Security benefits.Take the time to run the numbers on your unique situation to find out how much you can earn before you are taxed on that income.How Will Your Social Security Be Taxed?If a portion of your Social Security benefit is taxable, there’s no avoiding the federal income tax. But you won’t pay taxes based on your entire Social Security benefit. Instead, you will pay taxes on 50% or 85% of your total Social Security amount.If you’re a single filer with an income between $25,001 and $34,000, you’ll pay taxes on 50% of your Social Security benefits. But as a single filer who has a total income of more than $34,000, you’ll pay taxes on 85% of your Social Security benefits.Married couples filing jointly with an income between $32,001 and $44,000, you’ll pay taxes on 50% of your Social Security benefits. But as a married couple filing jointly that has a total income of more than $44,000, you’ll pay taxes on 85% of your Social Security benefits.Exceptions to This RuleEvery rule has an exception. In this case, filers in certain states need to be aware of their state’s tax requirements.There are 12 states that tax Social Security benefits. These include Colorado, Connecticut, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont and West Virginia. However, almost every one of these states allows for some kind of deduction, credit or income limit to minimize the tax burden at a state level.New Mexico doesn’t provide a way to minimize the burden. Instead, you’ll pay state taxes on all of the Social Security income taxed at a federal level.Can Retirees Ever Stop Filing Taxes?Filing your taxes is often an unwelcome chore. In some cases, there may be a point in your golden years when you can stop filing and paying taxes altogether. So how much can a retired person earn without paying taxes or even filing their taxes? For retirees 65 and older, here’s when you can stop filing taxes:Single retirees who earn less than $14,250Married retirees filing jointly, who earn less than $26,450 if one spouse is 65 or older or who earn less than $27,800 if both spouses are age 65 or olderMarried retirees filing separately who earn less than $5Retired heads of household age who earned less than $20,500Retired qualifying widowers who earned less than $26,450For those with an income below the listed thresholds, you may not have to pay taxes. But even if you don’t have to file your taxes, it’s usually your best interest to file anyways. That’s because you might qualify for a tax return, which could represent a big boost for your budget.If you aren’t sure whether or not you can stop filing taxes, the IRS has a helpful tool to help you find out. But talk to a financial advisor before deciding to skip filing your taxes. It could mean missing potential benefits.Bottom LineRetirement can be expensive. But depending on your income, you may be able to save on tax costs. It is possible to earn money during retirement and not have to pay taxes on the earnings. Just be aware of what the limits are, given your own situation. Also, check in with the tax code changes regularly because there are frequent changes to the rules.Retirement Tax Planning TipsConsider working with a financial advisor as you coordinate your earnings with your tax planning. Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you.

And stocks do not suddenly reverse from there,\" Lee said.But the stock market hitting record highs in January will likely soon be followed by a pullback of about 5% sometime in February or March, representing a period of consolidation for the stock market after it staged a 16% rally since the end of October.\"In the current context, we could see S&P 500 4,400 to 4,500 once we make all-time highs, or a modest pullback,\" Lee warned. \"This is consistent with our 2024 Year Ahead Outlook, where our base case is the S&P 500 makes most of its gains in [the] second half of 2024.\"Lee offered the following four reasons why he expects stocks to stage a pullback after January.1. The market could be getting ahead of the Federal Reserve in terms of interest rate cuts. While the Fed expects only three interest rate cuts in 2024, the market is currently pricing in six interest rate cuts next year. Any pullback in expectations of how many times the Fed cuts interest rates next year could lead to downside volatility in stocks.2. \"AI timeline could be pushed out due to a 'systematic hack' by malevolent AI,\" Lee said.3. \"Equity markets need to consolidate the parabolic gains from late 2023,\" Lee said.4. \"A drawdown in February/March timeframe is consistent with election year seasonal returns,\" Lee said.Any dips in the stock market next year should ultimately be bought, Fundstrat says, as technical strategist Mark Newton said in a note last week that trillions of dollars of cash on the sidelines should provide enough fire power to make any dips in stocks short-lived.Read the original article on Business Insider"}

Billionaire investors spend most of their time learning about the companies and industries they invest in, which doesn't make for great television.Everyday investors might not get to watch billionaire money managers perform their craft for a live audience, but they can come close. Every three months, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires nearly anyone who manages more than $100 million in assets to disclose their trading activity.In the third quarter, we saw a handful of billionaire money managers buy up millions of shares of two ultra-high-yield dividend stocks.The billionaires who manage the funds that bought these stocks will be the first to warn you that they make hundreds of trades every quarter, and they can't all be zingers. Here's a closer look at these businesses to see if following in the footsteps of billionaire money managers is the right move for your portfolio.Shares of AGNC Investment (NASDAQ: AGNC) offer a mind-blowing 14.4% yield at recent prices. This is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that doesn't own any real estate. Instead of collecting rent from tenants, it buys mortgage-backed securities that offer higher rates of return than its costs of capital.An eye-popping yield likely inspired Jeff Yass of Susquehanna to buy 1.4 million shares of AGNC in the third quarter. Yass isn't the only billionaire placing bets on this mortgage REIT. John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments scooped up 1.2 million shares.As its name implies, AGNC invests in mortgage-backed securities that are backed by a government agency in the event of a default. With the U.S. government guaranteeing each mortgage in the securities it buys, incoming cash flows are hyper-reliable.While AGNC's incoming cash flows are generally reliable, the company lost $0.68 per share in the third quarter because interest expenses rose sharply in 2022 and early 2023.Most income-seeking investors avoid AGNC stock and mortgage REITs in general because their interest expenses can rise sharply for reasons beyond their control. For example, rising interest rates can quickly lower the value of the mortgage-backed securities they use as collateral.With less collateral to offer, lenders could demand higher interest rates or worse. When mortgage-backed security values fall too fast, mREITs like AGNC can be forced to sell their assets at fire sale prices.Investors with a long-term mindset will notice that AGNC has lowered its payout by one-third over the past five years. Buying this stock made sense for billionaires with diverse portfolios managed by a team of professionals. For everyday investors who need a reliable passive income stream, though, it's probably best to steer clear of this mREIT and others like it.Medical Properties Trust (NYSE: MPW) is a REIT that specializes in hospitals and related facilities. At recent prices, the stock offers an eye-popping 12% yield.This huge yield inspired Philippe Laffont and Coatue Management to buy 5.7 million shares of the stock in the third quarter. Israel Englander and the fund he runs, Millennium Management, bought 3.3 million shares.This REIT has a diverse portfolio of 441 buildings spread throughout the U.S. and nine other countries. Medical Properties Trust usually gets hospital operators to sign long-term net leases that transfer all the variable costs of building ownership, such as taxes and maintenance, to tenants.The crucial role hospitals play in their communities, plus the use of net leases, should make Medical Properties Trust's cash flows hyper-reliable, but this hasn't been the case. A handful of large tenants that are having trouble making ends meet caused the company to slash its payout by 48% in September.Medical Properties Trust has a fairly diverse portfolio managed by 55 hospital operators. Unfortunately, nearly one-fifth of its assets are leased by Steward Health, which has been having a rough time lately. In November, we learned that Steward was late paying rent for September and October.Steward's situation could become even more challenging in 2024. The U.S. Department of Justice recently filed a complaint that alleges false claims, and it isn't the first time. Steward and related entities agreed to pay $4.7 million to settle a false claims violation in 2022.Medical Properties Trust's biggest tenant looks like a mess, but it probably won't prevent it from meeting its recently reduced dividend obligation. Adjusted funds from operations (FFO), a proxy for earnings used to evaluate REITs, came in at $0.30 per share during the third quarter. That's twice as much as it needed to make its latest dividend payment, which is set at $0.15 per share.Taking a chance on this REIT isn't a bad idea for income-seeking investors with lots of time ahead of their retirement. If you're already retired and need highly reliable dividend payments, though, it's probably best to keep looking.Should you invest $1,000 in AGNC Investment Corp. right now?Before you buy stock in AGNC Investment Corp., consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and AGNC Investment Corp. wasn't one of them.

That doesn't mean he ignores them entirely, though.When asked about artificial intelligence (AI) at Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) shareholder meeting in May, he paraphrased Albert Einstein's comments about the invention of the atomic bomb: \"It can change everything in the world, except how men think and behave.\"As such, he has some trepidation about how people and businesses will use AI, saying, \"When something can do all kinds of things, I get a little bit worried because I know we won't be able to un-invent it.\" Nonetheless, he happens to hold several companies in Berkshire's portfolio that are leading the development and distribution of artificial intelligence.There's one stock that's arguably his favorite AI stock of all: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Here's why.If there was any doubt that Apple, which accounts for nearly half of Berkshire's equity portfolio, was Buffett's favorite stock, he made his love for the iPhone maker clear at this year's shareholder meeting. He called the tech giant \"a better business than any we own.\"That is to say, he'd love to own more of Apple. Berkshire currently owns about 5.9% of Apple's outstanding shares, and Buffett notes its stake is increasing every quarter as Apple's management repurchases its stock. He also said selling some shares in 2020 for tax purposes was actually a mistake. And given the fact that Apple's share price has climbed 47% since the end of 2020, he's probably right.What makes Apple a better business than any of Berkshire's wholly owned subsidiaries, like GEICO or BNSF Railway? It's the fact that Apple's created a product that's become integral to modern life and that consumers love. \"I mean, it's an extraordinary product. We don't have anything like that, that we own 100% of,\" Buffett said, in reference to the iPhone.The smartphone is an invention that changed the world. And Apple's position in the smartphone market is incredibly strong despite dozens of competitors. Its market share of global smartphone sales sits in the high teens, but its phones generally remain in use longer than its competitors'. As a result, iPhones account for nearly 30% of all smartphones in use around the world, including over 58% of smartphones in the United States.Apple's strong brand and its ability to craft a superior user experience have helped it maintain its dominance in the space. And while other companies have tried to emulate Apple's strategy, they've proven mostly unsuccessful so far. It's unlikely Apple's going to lose its competitive advantage anytime soon.Buffett mostly views Apple as a consumer goods company. While there's a lot of technology behind its products, it sells those products, not the technology, to consumers. But investors can't ignore the fact that Apple is investing heavily in AI, and it stands to benefit from the growing use of the tech.During Apple's fourth-quarter earnings call in November, CEO Tim Cook said the company's investing quite a bit in generative AI. An October report from Bloomberg puts that number close to $1 billion per year, with a focus on building its own large language model and testing a ChatGPT-style chatbot. And while that's practically chump change for Apple, which has about $160 billion in cash and investments on its balance sheet and generates billions in free cash flow every quarter, that's a huge investment for most companies.What's more, Apple's making big improvements in its own chip designs. The M3 chips found in its latest Macs are capable of much more advanced AI processing thanks to redesigned GPUs and increased working memory. That makes its high-end MacBook a top choice for AI developers.Likewise, the chips inside the iPhone 15 use the same chip platform as the M3. That leads the way for on-device AI applications. That also means Apple could keep user data securely on the device instead of sending it to a web server, opening the door for more AI use cases involving more sensitive information.Indeed, Apple's biggest AI developments will take advantage of the very factor that drew Buffett to fall in love with the company in the first place: It has a widespread, growing platform to reach consumers. That should benefit its faster-growing and higher-margin services business for years to come as AI infiltrates our lives, much as the smartphone did in the last decade. Apple will be one of the companies that brings those AI uses to the masses.It's no wonder that Apple is Buffett's favorite company. And despite the fact that shares are trading near an all-time high, we may be sitting at the start of Apple's next round of growth, fueled by AI.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

The former chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch delivered his latest bleak outlook in a research note on Thursday.1. \"The equity market looks increasingly overbought, even to the most casual observer. The major averages, especially the Nasdaq, have become super-extended vis-à-vis their 50-day trendlines. Sentiment indicators are into extremes in terms of bullish complacency. Valuations remain stretched and are not compelling when benchmarked against the risk-free interest rate. And earnings estimates are no longer going up — in fact, they have started to reverse ever so slightly.\"2. \"We very likely will be in for a Santa hangover early in the New Year. To be sure, investors waiting to sell stocks until January for tax reasons are delaying that potential pullback, but ultimately, this could end up making for a nasty January.\"3. \"The economy is much more fragile than meets the eye.\" (Rosenberg pointed to a recent survey indicating business conditions are deteriorating, and underscored the last 10 economic indicators published in the past month including nonfarm payrolls, housing starts, and consumer spending have all shown downward revisions.)4. \"The fastest rate hiking cycle since the 1980s is beginning to bite — just as pundits and markets go all-in on the 'soft landing' narrative. Households are feeling the effects of the most aggressive tightening cycle since the 1980s, as financial distress in credit cards and auto loans reaches levels we last saw in the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The delinquent payments on these loans are expected to rise even further as layoffs increase and banks tighten their lending conditions.\"5. \"We have been in a 'soft landing' all year long, as was the case in 1979, 1989, 2000 and 2007. The 'soft landing' is the transition phase — the bridge — from the expansion phase of the business cycle to the contraction phase, which I believe will be next year's story. The Fed has locked itself into a downturn.\" (Rosenberg predicted the aggressive fiscal stimulus in 2023 would depress year-on-year growth, and underlined the delayed impacts of the most extreme rate-hiking cycle in four decades.)Read the original article on Business Insider"}

The median target among the 20 Wall Street strategists tracked by Bloomberg shows the benchmark index finishing 2024 at 4,850, less than 2% higher than where the benchmark closed 2023.Strategists at Goldman Sachs already boosted their 2024 target to reflect the recent run-up in stocks and the shift to a more dovish Fed. Goldman boosted its S&P 500 projection from 4,700 to 5,100 on Dec. 18.And the range for next year's targets is wide. Oppenheimer and Fundstrat are the most bullish, with year-end targets of 5,200 for the S&P 500, reflecting about 9% upside from the 2023 close. Meanwhile, the lowest call on the Street for 2024 is JPMorgan's prediction that the S&P will sink to 4,200, which would mark a 12% decline for the benchmark index in 2024.Much of the divide between bulls and bears headed into 2024 rests on where different firms see the economy headed next year.Those that either see the economy not entering a recession at all, or believe that outcome has been talked about so much it won't entail much impact for stocks, predict the S&P 500 hits at least 5,000 in 2024. That camp includes firms like Oppenheimer, Fundstrat, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, and Bank of America.Brian Belski at BMO calls any pending recession the \"Chicken Little recession,\" a reference to the fictional character who insists the sky is falling and causes mass hysteria over it. Belski thinks if there is a downturn next year it will be a \"recession in name only.\"\"We will continue to take our cue from labor market trends, and unless they take a sharp turn for the worse, we are simply not concerned about the recession debate at this point,\" Belski wrote in his 2024 outlook.The team at Deutsche Bank is still in the recession camp, though. The analysts see economic growth slowing and \"a mild recession\" in the first half of the year. But to the firm's chief US equity strategist Binky Chadha, the risks of recession would only lead to a \"modest short-lived sell-off.\"Others still see a recession weighing on stocks in 2024. Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel wrote that stocks will be \"down first into recession, then higher as inflation hits the [Fed's 2%] target.\" Emanuel believes the recession will come in the first half of the year before a rally leads the S&P 500 to his 4,750 target.JPMorgan's equity strategists are even more cautious about what a downturn could spell for stocks as they project the benchmark average closing 2024 at 4,200.\"Absent rapid Fed easing, we expect a more challenging macro backdrop for stocks next year with softening consumer trends at a time when investor positioning and sentiment have mostly reversed,\" JPMorgan equity strategists led by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas wrote in the team's 2024 outlook on Nov. 29.Lakos-Bujas's point about Fed easing is a key sticking point in the bulls-versus-bears argument. At a high level, there are two basic reasons the Fed would cut interest rates, which it currently forecasts it will do three times in 2024. The Fed would lower rates if the economy meaningfully slowed to ease financial conditions and help keep it afloat.Or the Fed would cut rates because inflation falls toward the central bank's 2% target more quickly than anticipated. This is the scenario Goldman Sachs cited when boosting its outlook for stocks in mid-December.\"Resilient growth and falling rates should benefit stocks with weaker balance sheets, particularly those that are sensitive to economic growth,\" Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a strategy note.In the past, whether or not a recession lies ahead has played a key role in whether stocks rally or fall following the first interest rate cut. A graph from Goldman Sachs shows that stocks typically fall if a recession hits in the 12 months following the first Fed rate cut.A well-documented aspect of the 2023 stock market rally was how seven large technology stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — drove most of the market's gains. But in the final two months of the year, the rally broadened out, and many strategists see that market breadth continuing in 2024.\"We forecast an all-time high for the S&P 500 in 2024, with a year-end target of 5000. But unlike this year during which the Magnificent 7 did 70% of the work, we expect broader leadership,\" Bank of America head of US equity and quantitative strategy Savita Subramanian wrote in a December note to clients.Fundstrat founder Tom Lee places Technology and FAANG stocks among his top three sectors for 2024. But after a massive run-up in 2023, Lee doesn't see tech leading the way again next year.\"Do I think there's enough juice in FAANG from earnings plus multiple expansion to outperform small caps? I don't think so,\" Lee said during his 2024 outlook Zoom call on Dec. 7. \"I think small caps could rise 50% next year easily. And Financials could rise 30% ... When it comes to positioning no one owns Financials and no one's really long small caps. There's a lot of upside.\"Kostin at Goldman Sachs also gave a shout-out to small caps in his recent 2024 outlook.\"An environment of falling interest rates and improving economic growth expectations historically has been supportive for small-caps, which have recently traded at depressed valuations,\" Kostin wrote.\"This likely opens the door for increased participation with traditional growth areas (especially within Technology) ...Given the outperformance of growth, we believe investors should be much more prudent and focus on themes (not just liquidity or momentum), stable growth, and even dividends within Growth sectors.\"\"We believe there is a very good chance that the 'Magnificent 7' will not be as unified in terms of performance trends in 2024,\" Belski wrote in his 2024 outlook. \"For instance, company-specific fundamentals are very different, with recent price performance trends in the 4Q portending to increasingly varied performance in 2024.\"\"This likely opens the door for increased participation with traditional growth areas (especially within Technology) ... Given the outperformance of growth, we believe investors should be much more prudent and focus on themes (not just liquidity or momentum), stable growth, and even dividends within Growth sectors.\"Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"}

Gates’s investment savvy extends through his firm Cascade, which holds stakes in luxury hotels and other ventures.Gates’s collection of luxury vehicles, private jets and art reflects his eclectic interests, while his philanthropic efforts underscore his commitment to global causes that support initiatives in health, renewable energy and more.As a notorious philanthropist, much of Gates's earnings go toward charitable efforts, mainly through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2023, the foundation committed $8.3 billion to fight poverty, disease and inequality, marking a 15% increase from the previous year. The foundation aims to increase its payout to $9 billion by 2026.In 2023, Gates expanded his investment portfolio, indicating a strategic approach to wealth management.

In fact, research from the Social Security Administration found that benefits were the largest source of income for 40% of retired workers in 2015. Similarly, a survey from MassMutual found that 42% of workers nearing retirement in 2023 expect benefits to be their largest source of income when they retire.In that context, understanding how much income Social Security might provide is a critical part of the retirement planning process. Generally speaking, benefits replace about 40% of pre-retirement earnings, but examining trends in the average Social Security payout can also be useful.Read on to see the average Social Security benefit right now, how the average payout has trended since 2000, and what the average benefit might be in 2030.The Social Security Administration publishes a monthly snapshot detailing payment information to various groups of beneficiaries. The most recent snapshot shows that 50 million retired workers received a Social Security benefit in November 2023, and the average payout was $1,844.76. That represents a 126% increase from November 2000, when the average payout was $815.62.The chart below shows the average retired-worker benefit in November of each year dating back to 2000.YearAverage Retired-Worker Benefit2000$815.622001$851.912002$882.192003$902.622004$929.432005$962.122006$1,010.572007$1,053.742008$1,089.282009$1,163.552010$1,174.742011$1,185.332012$1,239.362013$1,273.922014$1,305.582015$1,340.482016$1,354.782017$1,375.292018$1,420.102019$1,477.972020$1,522.702021$1,563.822022$1,677.522023$1,844.76Data source: The Social Security Administration.After examining the chart above, readers may wonder: Why did the average Social Security benefit for retired workers increase 126% (or 3.6% annually) over the last 23 years? And how might the payout change in the future?There are two primary reasons the average Social Security retired-worker benefit has increased over time. First, the initial payout is impacted by changes in general wage levels, as measured by the average wage index (AWI). Second, subsequent payments are adjusted annually based on changes in inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W).Generally speaking, the AWI and the CPI-W increase from one year to the next, so the average Social Security payout also increases. Here's a more detailed description on how the AWI and CPI-W impact retired-worker benefits:The average wage index is used to calculate the average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) amount for each retired worker. Specifically, the AIME is determined by (1) indexing income from the 35 highest-paid years of work to the AWI and (2) converting that figure to a monthly average. Indexing income to the AWI ensures that benefits reflect living standard increases that occur during a worker's lifetime. Once the AIME is determined, that figure is run through the Social Security benefits formula to determine the primary insurance amount, which is the benefit a worker would receive if they claimed Social Security at their full retirement age.Inflation impacts Social Security payouts through annual cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs). Benefits are modified each year based on changes in the third-quarter CPI-W, which itself measures how consumer prices change over time. For instance, the CPI-W increased 3.2% in the third quarter of 2023, so Social Security benefits will get a 3.2% COLA in 2024. Those annual COLAs ensure that benefits retain buying power as prices rise across the economy.Here's the upshot: The average Social Security retired-worker benefit has increased each year since 2000. That phenomenon is due to payouts being tied to wages and inflation, both of which have increased over time. Indeed, the AWI has increased at roughly 3.1% annually since 2000, and the third-quarter CPI-W has increased at roughly 2.5% annually since 2000.As mentioned, the average Social Security benefit for retired workers has increased at roughly 3.6% annually since 2000. If that trajectory remains constant over the next seven years, the average Social Security benefit for retired workers will increase 28% to reach $2,363 by November 2030.To be clear, that number is merely an estimate. The precise increase depends on how wages and inflation trend over the next seven years. It also depends on workers' behavior. Benefits are adjusted for early and delayed retirement, so a meaningful shift in claiming age could also impact the average payout.The $21,756 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlookIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings.

Doing so before they take off is an entirely different story. However, it's not an impossible task.Three Motley Fool contributors think they've identified stocks that could be monster winners in 2024. Here's why they picked CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CRSP), Madrigal Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: MDGL), and Verona Pharma (NASDAQ: VRNA).Prosper Junior Bakiny (CRISPR Therapeutics): It's been a great year for the field of gene editing. Several companies that specialize in this area have made important progress. However, the most significant milestone arguably came from CRISPR Therapeutics, which, together with its partner Vertex Pharmaceuticals, earned approval for Casgevy.This treatment for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia (two rare blood diseases) is the first gene-editing therapy on the market that uses the CRISPR technique, which earned its pioneers a Nobel Prize in chemistry. While CRISPR Therapeutics' shares haven't performed particularly well since Casgevy's U.S. approval in early December, next year could be different.CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex are now launching this medicine. With a price tag of $2.2 million in the U.S., its boasts massive, multibillion-dollar potential.It won't happen overnight, though. Gene-editing treatments are challenging to administer, and the process takes some time. However, the two partners will use the next 12 months to set a solid foundation for Casgevy's long-term success.The exercise will include getting third-party payers on board -- something Vertex Pharmaceuticals has plenty of experience with -- and activating authorized treatment centers where the medicine can be safely and effectively administered. In the meantime, CRISPR Therapeutics will make progress on other CRISPR-based gene-editing treatments.With the approval of Casgevy, the company's work no longer looks hypothetical. The rest of CRISPR Therapeutics' lineup uses the same CRISPR gene-editing technique with which Casgevy was developed. For all those reasons, CRISPR Therapeutics could be a major winner in 2024 -- and beyond.Keith Speights (Madrigal Pharmaceuticals): With a market cap hovering around $4.7 billion, Madrigal Pharmaceuticals isn't a monster stock right now. The company's shares fell by a double-digit percentage in 2023 while the overall stock market soared. However, this biotech stock began to bounce back in late October, and I think this rebound could soon gain momentum.I'm not the only one who's bullish about Madrigal. The consensus 12-month price target for the stock reflects an upside potential of over 30%. All three of the analysts surveyed by LSEG in December who cover Madrigal rated the stock as a buy.There's a simple reason behind this optimism. Madrigal hopes to win U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for resmetirom in treating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) by March 14, 2024. The clinical data for the drug looks solid. Importantly, there are currently no FDA-approved therapies for treating NASH, which has quickly become the top cause of liver transplants in the U.S.Madrigal appears to be in a good financial position to fund the potential commercial launch of resmetirom. The company raised $500 million via a public stock offering in October.SVB Financial Group analysts think that resmetirom can generate peak annual sales of around $2.5 billion. Jefferies Financial Group projects even higher peak sales of $3 billion. Whatever the actual amount is, Madrigal could soon begin to rake in significant revenue.I look for new CEO Bill Sibold to channel some of its newfound riches into expanding the pipeline. Sibold's experience at Sanofi should give him a good foundation to lead Madrigal in its next stage of growth.David Jagielski (Verona Pharma): One stock with tremendous potential heading into 2024 is Verona Pharma. It's a risky business to invest in as it doesn't have an approved product, revenue is inconsistent, and it has incurred net losses of just under $51 million over the trailing 12 months.But Verona's financials and its prospects could soon get a big upgrade. That's because the company has a promising treatment in its pipeline for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. Ensifentrine is an investigational drug that has demonstrated safety and efficacy in phase 3 trials, showing improvements in lung functions.There are an estimated 380 million patients with COPD, which is the third-leading cause of death worldwide. While there are treatments available in the market, many patients are dissatisfied with the current options, and the majority continue to have symptoms even when they're receiving treatments. Ensifentrine gives patients a new alternative and has scored well in reducing symptoms for patients and improving their quality of life.The FDA is reviewing the drug, with a PDUFA date set for June 26, 2024. If ensifentrine obtains approval, it would be a huge win for Verona. The drug could generate close to $1.5 billion in annual revenue by 2033. Approval could be a game changer for Verona, as it would give it a source of consistent revenue.If you're willing to take a chance on this small biotech stock, the gains could be massive next year. The consensus price target is just under $33, implying a potential upside of close to 60% for investors who buy now. It's admittedly risky, but Verona offers an incredibly promising upside.Should you invest $1,000 in CRISPR Therapeutics right now?Before you buy stock in CRISPR Therapeutics, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and CRISPR Therapeutics wasn't one of them.

But a lot of work has to go into the strategies you make and the actions that you take. That also includes how you handle your finances in case of an emergency. So if you have it, $6 million will definitely work. Here’s how to think about it.For more hands-on help, consider working with a financial advisor who can help create a financial plan for your investments.Can You Retire Early With $6 Million?Whenever calculating your retirement prospect, there are two important issues to consider: withdrawals and emergencies. Essentially, will you have enough money to replace your income? And will that leave you with enough flexibility to pay for a sudden expense?The rule of thumb for figuring all this out is that you should expect to replace 80% of your working income while in retirement. You generally need less money than when you were working because you have fewer responsibilities and expenses, plus you aren’t contributing to a retirement fund anymore.So an 80% target should give you the same degree of spending power and emergency flexibility that you have right now.For example, let’s say you made $150,000 per year during your working life; we’ll assume a higher-income household since you have saved up $6 million. You would want to plan for a retirement account that can generate $120,000 per year throughout your retirement (80% of $150,000).Even without returns of any kind, just coasting on principal, a $6 million portfolio can pay you $120,000 per year for 50 years. For someone who retires at 55, that will give you retirement savings to live until you’re 105 years old and this is even before we account for Social Security.As you get older, once you hit your 90s perhaps, you might want to begin economizing a little bit, but otherwise this is a very comfortable amount of money. Of course, there are two more issues to consider: lifestyle and returns.Returns Change The Math In Your FavorPerhaps the most important, and most undervalued, aspect of in-retirement financial planning is this: Your portfolio will continue to generate returns throughout your retirement.At the higher end, if you invest entirely in the S&P 500 you can expect a lot of volatility but long-term returns of 10% – 13% per year. At the lower end, if you invest entirely in bonds you can expect low volatility but long-term yields of 1.6% per year. And if you split the difference to invest in annuities, you can expect guaranteed payments that range based on the specific institution and contract.With a $6 million portfolio, those returns would come out roughly to:S&P 500 Index – $600,000 per year in capital gains returns, with periodic lossesBonds – $96,000 in yield payments, with losses quite rareAnnuities – Potentially $300,000 per year in payments, guaranteed by the insurerIt’s important to note two things with bonds. First, most of the time you don’t need to worry about the value (otherwise known as the return) on bonds. You aren’t trying to sell them, just collect the income from their coupon payments, so fluctuations in the bond market won’t be a big concern for your portfolio.Second, these are long-term instruments, but not as long as your retirement. When various bonds expire, you will need to decide whether to keep the cash they generate or buy new instruments.Lifestyle and ExpensesWithout diving too deep, it’s important to understand that your needs will have to be balanced with your lifestyle. If you have saved up $6 million, the odds are that you are a high-income household. That means that you likely have a relatively expensive lifestyle to maintain. Now, based on the returns of a $6 million portfolio, it’s likely that you can do this. Even choosing the middle-of-the-road option with an annuity will generate $300,000 per year, enough to be comfortable.Just make sure that this matches your specific needs. This portfolio can generate a lot of returns and principal, but how much is enough will depend on your individual circumstances. Someone with quiet tastes and low costs of living will have a very different financial footprint than someone who likes to travel and who lives in San Francisco or Manhattan.The best way to think about this is by looking at your personal budget. How much do you spend right now on your costs of living? Those numbers may go down. Other costs, especially health care needs, may go up. So make sure you have a good margin for error.Losses Of Early RetirementThe major factor when it comes to retiring at age 55 is your opportunity cost.Specifically, remember this: Compound returns mean that most of your portfolio’s growth happens in your later years. Retiring earlier means that you sacrifice all of these potential gains.When you retire, your first decision will be when to claim Social Security. You should plan on doing this at age 70 because that will maximize your benefits. If you cannot wait until 70 to begin taking Social Security you may be able to make a different plan, but most likely you should reconsider early retirement.Your second will involve health care. If you’re like most Americans, you get health insurance through your employer. Since Medicare doesn’t begin until 65 you will need to find private insurance, and that typically costs several hundred dollars per month. Make sure to budget for this in your plans.Finally, be sure to account for your losses in future earnings. Retirement means three major things for your portfolio. First, you switch from adding new money to taking money out. Second, you likely shift it to a more conservative series of investments.Third, your gains no longer compound the way they used to. Instead, your portfolio’s returns begin to replace your income rather than adding to the principal of your assets. This makes a big difference.Bottom LineYes, $6 million is more than enough to retire at age 55, especially with smart money management and budgeting. Just make sure you are aware that this will involve sacrificing a lot of potential gains in your portfolio overall.Investment TipsEven those who already have an interest in looking for a financial advisor may find it difficult to locate one they are happy with and can trust. If you don’t have a financial advisor yet, finding one doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you’re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.Building an investment portfolio is not an easy venture. But if you want your investments integrated with a financial plan, a financial advisor with a certified financial planner (CFP) certification can help you. These advisors often deal with tax planning, retirement planning, estate planning and more.Photo credit: ©iStock.com/AscentXmedia, ©iStock.com/gradyreese, ©iStock.com/     adamkazThe post Is $6 million Enough to Retire at 55? appeared first on SmartAsset Blog."}

A separate index for just Rolex models fell 31% over a similar period.The US central bank's aggressive monetary tightening from March 2022 through July this year is seen as a key reason for the slump in watch prices. Higher interest rates have fueled fears of an economic downturn, spurring investors to scale back luxury spending and boost savings. A setback in the crypto market, also precipitated by rate rises, has also hurt demand for watches.The costliest timepieces suffered the worst declines. Those in the $50,001 to $100,000 price bracket slumped over 10% in the past 12 months, while the $10,001 to $20,000 group fell about 7%, according to WatchCharts data. The $5,001 to $10,000 band also dropped 7%.Luxury watches have underperformed stocks since March 2022, when the Fed started raising interest rates. The S&P 500 index of US large-cap shares is up by over 12% since then.Certain chronometer brands have felt the bite more than others. The Rolex Market Index, which tracks the 30 most valuable models, is down 8% from a year ago, while the Patek Philippe index lost 16%. Audemars Piguet saw the sharpest losses, down 19% year on year, WatchCharts data showed.When the \"everything rally\" was in full swing earlier in the pandemic, luxury watches were no exception. Surplus cash was piling into all kinds of alternative investments — such as nonfungible tokens and meme stocks — opulent timepieces were swept along with the tide.Prices of Rolexes, Patek Philippes, and Piguets reached record highs in early 2022. Preowned watch sales reached $22 billion in 2021 — nearly one-third of the $75 billion luxury-watch market, a report from Boston Consulting Group found.Despite the declines over the past year, prices have climbed considerably higher over the longer term, outperforming the stock market. The Rolex index is up by more than 42% from five years ago.\"Luxury watches have performed well, especially over the long term, in comparison with traditional investment categories,\" BCG said in a report published earlier this year. \"From August 2018 to January 2023, average prices in the secondhand market for top models from the three largest luxury brands — Rolex, Patek Philippe, and Audemars Piguet — rose at an annual rate of 20%, despite broader market downturns during the pandemic, compared with an annual rate of 8% for the S&P 500 index.\"This article was originally published on July 30, 2023.Read the original article on Business Insider"}

Of course, the famous investor's philosophy of buying high-risk, high-reward companies also means that there will be periods of volatility, which is evident from the big beating Wood's funds took in 2022. That explains why Wood has an investment timeline of five years, which allows her investments to ride through periods of volatility.The good part is that Wood's investments could benefit from a favorable stock market scenario in 2024. A potential cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve could give growth stocks a nice shot in the arm in the New Year, which is why investors may want to buy one of Wood's top 10 holdings before it jumps higher.Shares of Twilio (NYSE: TWLO) have climbed 52% since the beginning of November. Let's look at the reasons this tech stock could sustain its impressive momentum and head higher.Twilio is the ninth largest component of the Ark Innovation ETF, and it's worth noting that Wood and her team have been actively buying shares of this cloud communications specialist in 2023. That's not surprising, as Twilio operates in a market that's expected to grow at a robust pace in the long run.Twilio's cloud-based software platforms allow companies to communicate with their customers through multiple channels, such as text, voice, email, chat, and video. Customer service associates simply need a computer and the internet to connect with customers from anywhere in the world.These cloud-based contact centers enjoy several advantages over traditional ones. For instance, companies don't need to spend on infrastructure such as office space or on-site servers in the case of a cloud contact center. It's easily scalable based on an organization's requirements and also helps improve the customer service experience, as associates can reach customers using various channels.Not surprisingly, the need for cloud-based contact centers is predicted to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26% through 2028 and hit annual revenue of $69 billion at the end of the forecast period, according to Mordor Intelligence. That kind of performance should help Twilio come out of its recent slump, which has been triggered by a weak customer spending environment.The company is expected to finish 2023 with a 7% jump in revenue to $4.1 billion, followed by an identical increase next year. However, as the following chart indicates, Twilio's growth is predicted to accelerate from 2025.Members of Twilio management pointed out in the company's investor-day presentation in November 2022 that they expect revenue to increase at a CAGR of 15% to 25% in the medium term. Assuming Twilio can maintain even a 15% revenue growth rate over the three-year period from 2026, its top line could jump to $7.65 billion in 2028, using the 2025 revenue estimate of $5 billion as the base.Twilio has a five-year average sales multiple of 15. However, it's now trading at just 3.5 times sales. Assuming it can maintain its current sales multiple after five years, Twilio's market cap could jump to almost $27 billion, based on the $7.65 billion revenue estimate for 2028. That would be a 94% jump from current levels, suggesting that this \"Cathie Wood stock\" could give investors healthy returns over five years.And finally, Twilio's current price-to-sales ratio is significantly lower than the five-year average, which is why investors should consider buying it right away given the potential upside it could deliver in the long run.Should you invest $1,000 in Twilio right now?Before you buy stock in Twilio, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Twilio wasn't one of them.

This oft-cited guideline can help you identify a retirement savings goal, but it doesn’t fully account for how much of those savings will cover in retirement.Enter Fidelity’s 45% rule, which states that your retirement savings should generate about 45% of your pretax, pre-retirement income each year, with Social Security benefits covering the rest of your spending needs.A financial advisor can analyze your income needs and help you plan for retirement. Find an advisor today.The financial services firm analyzed spending data for working people between 50 and 65 years old and found that most retirees need to replace between 55% and 80% of their pre-retirement income in order to preserve their current lifestyle. Because retirees have lower day-to-day expenses and don’t typically contribute to retirement accounts, their income requirements are lower than people who are still working.As a result, a retiree who was earning $100,000 a year would need between $55,000 and $80,000 per year in Social Security benefits and savings withdrawals (including pension benefits) to continue their current lifestyle.Fidelity’s 45% guideline dictates that a retiree’s nest egg should be large enough to replace 45% of their pre-retirement, pretax income each year. Following this rule, the same retiree who was earning $100,000 per year would need enough saved up to spend $45,000 a year, in addition to his Social Security benefits, to fund his lifestyle. Assuming the person lives another 25 years after reaching retirement age, this person would need $1.125 million in savings.If you’re ready to be matched with local advisors that can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.Pre-Retirement Income Plays an Important RoleBut all retirement spending plans aren’t equal. Those who earned less money during their careers will have less saved than high earners, and as a result, will need to replace a larger proportion of their pre-retirement income.“Your salary plays a big role in determining what percentage of your income you will need to replace in retirement,” Fidelity wrote in its most recent Viewpoints. “People with higher incomes tend to spend a small portion of their income during their working years, and that means a lower income replacement goal in percentage terms to maintain their lifestyle in retirement.”According to Fidelity, a person who makes $50,000 per year would need savings and Social Security to replace approximately 80% of his income in retirement. An individual earning $200,000, however, could get by in retirement by replacing just 60%.Social Security plays a less significant role in the retirement plans of higher-earning workers. Consider the table below:Replacing Income Using Fidelity’s 45% Rule Pre-Retirement Income Replacement Rate From Savings Replacement Rate From Social Security Total Replacement Rate $50,000 45% 35% 80% $100,000 45% 27% 72% $200,000 45% 16% 61% $300,000 44% 11% 55%According to Fidelity, a retiree who made $50,000 per year would receive 35% of that income via Social Security. But a high-earning individual who made $300,000 per year would only see 11% of his income replaced by Social Security benefits. While higher-earning individuals don’t need to replace as much of their pre-retirement income, retirement savings plays a more important role for these types of retirees.Bottom LineFidelity’s 10x rule of thumb is a nifty guideline to follow as you save for retirement over the course of many decades. But when retirement arrives, Fidelity recommends that your savings should cover 45% of your income needs, with Social Security covering the rest. As a result, the average retiree will need to replace between 55% and 80% of his pre-retirement, pretax income to maintain his current lifestyle.Tips for Retirement PlanningA financial advisor can be an invaluable resource when it comes to planning for retirement. Whether it’s saving in tax-advantaged accounts or mapping out your income needs, an advisor can help you with your retirement planning needs.Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you’re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.While people can start collecting Social Security benefits at age 62, delaying collection will result in higher benefits.

{"date": "2023-12-31-11-05", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/2-unstoppable-artificial-intelligence-ai-181500685.html", "text_blocks": "Artificial intelligence (AI) swept investors into a frenzy in 2023. It all started with Microsoft's $10 billion bet in January on generative AI start-up OpenAI, which develops the famous ChatGPT online chatbot. Then in September Amazon invested $4 billion in OpenAI rival Anthropic.But those trillion-dollar tech giants weren't the only ones scooping up AI assets. Everyday investors identified several small-cap AI stocks with explosive potential throughout the year, including C3.ai (NYSE: AI) and Upstart Holdings (NASDAQ: UPST). Those stocks recorded gains of 159% and 217%, respectively in 2023, and 2024 could bring more upside.Here's why it isn't too late to buy into those opportunities in the new year.Founded in 2009, C3.ai was one of the first companies ever to provide AI products and services to businesses. Today it has developed over 40 ready-made and customizable applications to bring AI to at least 10 different industries, accelerating its customers' adoption of the technology.For example, the C3.ai Demand Forecasting platform can help businesses improve the accuracy of their forward sales projections by up to 15%. That allows them to maintain more appropriate inventory levels and pricing, which leads to happier customers.Similarly, C3.ai Reliability is the ultimate predictive maintenance tool, and can slash unplanned equipment downtime in half by detecting unusual activity before it leads to catastrophe. It's used by some of the world's largest organizations, including Shell and the U.S. Air Force.C3.ai's revenue growth slowed to a crawl over the last 18 months. It was the expected temporary consequence of a major shift away from subscription-based deals and toward consumption-based deals. Subscriptions require lengthy negotiations between C3.ai and the customer, which increases acquisition costs and slows the onboarding process. By moving to a consumption model, customers can come and go as they please and simply pay for what they use.C3.ai is still transitioning its existing customers over to the new model, but progress is now ramping up quickly. In the recent fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Oct. 31), the company's revenue came in at $73.2 million, which represented a 17% year-over-year increase. That was the fastest growth rate in over a year, and C3.ai's projections suggest it will continue to accelerate in the coming quarters.C3.ai stock gained 159% in 2023, but it remains 83% below its all-time high, which was set during the tech frenzy at the end of 2020. Investors got a little carried away with the company's valuation back then, but that created an opportunity for new buyers to scoop up C3.ai stock at a discount now ahead of a material projected upswing in its business.Upstart was a stock market darling during the pandemic. It went public at $20 per share in December 2020, and it soared to $401 in less than a year. The company has developed an AI-based algorithm designed to assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers, and it experienced explosive growth while interest rates were sitting at historic lows.But the soaring inflation and rising interest rates that followed in 2022 sent Upstart stock plunging 97%. Demand for unsecured personal loans and car loans -- Upstart's two main segments -- collapsed, and investors became worried the company's AI algorithm wasn't battle-tested in such a challenging economic environment.But after publishing mountains of data to the contrary, Upstart stock has jumped 217% in 2023. It remains roughly 90% below its all-time high, but that might spell opportunity for investors who buy in now and hold for the long term.See, Upstart's AI-powered approach likely represents the future of lending. Its algorithm can autonomously analyze 1,600 data points on a potential borrower and deliver an instant approval 88% of the time. It's far more efficient than manual human-led assessment methods that rely on Fair Isaac's FICO credit scoring system, especially considering it only focuses on five core metrics to determine creditworthiness.Plus, Wall Street experts believe the U.S. Federal Reserve will slash interest rates six times in 2024, which could reignite consumers' demand for loans. Upstart's revenue is on track to fall by 40% in 2023 compared to 2022, but Wall Street analysts are predicting it will return to growth in 2024 thanks in part to those improved conditions for borrowers.Upstart doesn't lend any money itself. It originates loans on behalf of more than 100 bank and credit union partners and earns fees for doing so. More than $4 trillion worth of personal loans, car loans, business loans, and mortgages are originated in the U.S. each year, and yet Upstart has only originated $35 billion in its history. That implies a long runway for growth.Upstart just entered the mortgage segment with its home equity line of credit (HELOC) product. It's the company's largest-ever opportunity, and now could be a great time for investors to buy its stock ahead of that business ramping up.Should you invest $1,000 in C3.ai right now?Before you buy stock in C3.ai, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and C3.ai wasn't one of them.

If you can buy a quality stock at a relatively low price, though, so much the better.Here are three high-quality, low-cost value stocks, meeting that description, that you could buy sizable stakes in now and hold on to for years.While U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) is one of the 10 largest financial institutions in the country, it is smaller than the likes of JPMorgan Chase or Bank of America, and doesn't do as much business in certain areas the banking giants are best known for. For instance, corporate fundraising, institutional trading, and wealth management aren't major profit centers for U.S. Bank. This limits its revenue and earnings growth prospects, particularly when the economy is firing on all cylinders.Yet in many ways, a simpler suite of product and service offerings is advantageous to U.S. Bancorp's investors. Primary among that -- the bank can better focus on doing the things it does (like consumer lending) well. And its results are more predictable because they're less cyclical.That's what the graph below shows us. While the subprime mortgage meltdown and the COVID-19 pandemic clearly undermined its top and bottom lines, it's also clear that U.S. Bancorp quickly recovered from both and got back on its long-standing growth track. Not every bigger banking outfit can say the same.Boring? A little. But that's the point -- if you're going to be sitting on a stock for many years, you want to be able to count on the underlying company's progress. U.S. Bancorp reliably logs it, even if never at tremendous speed. And shareholders collect decent dividends all the while. Its yield of 4.4% at the current share price is better than average.Newcomers will be stepping into U.S. Bank's stock at 13.1 times earnings, and only 10.4 times its forward earnings.Shares of Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) may not be as cheap as U.S. Bancorp's are -- the drugmaker's price-to-earnings ratio stands at 15.5, while its forward price-to-earnings ratio is a little under 12. Still, those valuations are cheap, and certainly below average pharmaceutical stock valuations right now.There's no sense in ignoring the 800-pound gorilla in the room here: Governments are effectively winding down their intense efforts to combat COVID-19. Although new variants continue to surface, and a seasonal surge in new cases is underway, demand for vaccines and treatments is waning. Pfizer's third-quarter revenue fell 42% year over year, with slumping sales of the company's COVID products responsible for the entirety of that dip. Don't be surprised to see this weakness linger at least a little while longer.Just don't tarry too long if you're considering eventually opening a new position in Pfizer stock. The current quarter should be the last one to show a major year-over-year sales tumble due to people's fading concerns about the virus. Beginning in early 2024, Pfizer's business results will largely reflect demand for everything else in its portfolio and pipeline.And that's exciting, to be sure.Among other things, Pfizer owns blood thinner Eliquis, cardiomyopathy treatment Vyndaqel, pneumonia vaccine Prevnar, and cancer-fighting Ibrance, to name just a few. These are all blockbuster drugs, but they haven't realized their full potential yet because of the pandemic. Never even mind its pipeline, where you'll find sickle cell disease treatment Oxbryta, multiple myeloma therapy Elranatamab, and hemophilia drug Marstacimab. All told, Pfizer believes its current pipeline could be producing $20 billion worth of annual revenue by 2030, contributing to up to $84 billion worth of annual companywide sales that year thanks to its recent acquisition of Seagen. From here, the company will put its focus back on these longer-lived opportunities.The kicker: There are credible plans to simultaneously begin culling at least $4 billion worth of annual costs.There's not a lot not to like here if you're truly looking a few years down the road.Last but not least, add Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) to your list of value stocks to buy now and hold for years.It's not exactly a household name. In fact, there's a decent chance you've never even heard of the company, which also goes by TSMC. There's also a strong chance, however, that you're using technology manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor right now without even realizing it.Although tech giants like Intel and Nvidia are starting to handle more of their own manufacturing, the bulk of this work is still farmed out to third parties capable of cranking out silicon designed by more familiar players. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company isn't just one of these contract manufacturers. It's the world's biggest, with more than half of the third-party semiconductor fabrication market.The company was hit as hard as any other by the COVID-19 pandemic, which not only crimped demand, but banged up supply chains as well (coming and going). The turbulence is still bumping the business around, too. Analysts believe Taiwan Semiconductor is on pace to fall nearly 9% for the full year.The supply headaches of the pandemic have also inspired several big tech names to become more self-sufficient. Intel is investing billions of dollars to build two different chip foundries in the United States, for example, while Micron has budgeted up to $100 billion to build what it refers to as a \"megafab\" in central New York.Yet, despite these initiatives, the world still needs third-party chip foundries. This is going to remain the case for a long while, too, if not forever. In fact, Taiwan Semiconductor is so certain its advanced capabilities and services will remain in demand for the foreseeable future that it's building its own production facility in Arizona. And, given the 19.5% revenue growth expected of the company in the coming year, that's arguably the right call. It's a sign that the chip business is recovering, and bringing Taiwan Semiconductor along for the ride.Trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 16.6, TSMC isn't exactly a screaming value. However, it's below this ticker's recent average earnings ratio, and below the valuations many of its peers are sporting right now.Should you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn't one of them.

Sure, there's a bright outlook for the software-as-a-service specialist as it benefits from lower costs and soaring sales growth. Yet, much of that enthusiasm is reflected in Shopify's elevated valuation.There are other good options for growth stock investors to consider if Shopify's big premium turns them off. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA) shares could be even better buys for 2024 and beyond.E-commerce sales have finally started growing again after big declines following the pandemic, but that's not the only factor driving Amazon's stock higher these days. Wall Street is salivating over robust sales gains in the tech giant's cloud services segment, home to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) juggernaut. This unit accounts for well over half of Amazon's business and will likely grow in importance over the coming decades.Growth in both the products and services divisions contributed to Amazon's most recent 13% sales increase for the third quarter. Wall Street pros are forecasting a similar bounce for the holiday quarter as revenue improves to $129 billion from $114 billion a year ago.Amazon is cranking out far higher profits on that rising sales base, too. For example, cost cuts in recent quarters have helped cash flow turn highly positive. Amazon has generated $21 billion of free cash flow in the past year compared to a nearly $30 billion outflow a year earlier.That success should have investors feeling confident that rising profit margins are on the way, likely helping the stock continue beating the market in 2024 and beyond. Shares aren't priced at a huge premium, either. You can own Amazon stock for less than 3 times sales compared to Shopify's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 15.Okta is another potential steal of a growth stock, priced below 7 times sales as of late 2023. The digital identity and cybersecurity specialist is expanding its sales at an over 20% rate while taking big steps toward sustainable profitability. Enterprises prioritized these spending niches in 2022 and 2023, even as they pulled back in other IT areas, highlighting the cybersecurity industry's recession-resistant nature.Okta isn't profitable today, but two big signals imply positive earnings are on the way. The first is free cash flow, which is on track to land at roughly 20% of sales in 2023. Executives are projecting that non-GAAP (adjusted) profit margin will improve to 17% of sales next year, too, from the expected 13% rate in fiscal 2023. For context, Okta posted a 1% loss by that metric in fiscal 2022.Right now, the main knock against the stock is that sales growth is likely to slow significantly in the coming year, whereas Shopify has a clearer path toward maintaining an over 20% expansion rate. Still, the stock's cheaper valuation could set patient investors up for some solid returns as Okta continues winning market share in its software-as-a-service industry niche.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

{"date": "2023-12-31-11-06", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/3-stocks-could-increase-dividend-115500085.html", "text_blocks": "Investing in dividend growth stocks is one way to create a life-changing passive income portfolio for retirement.Dividend growth stocks are typically well-established companies that consistently grow their profits year after year. They predictably give shareholders a raise every year as their profits climb. And over time, they can produce market-beating returns.Over the last 50 years, stocks that initiated and increased their dividend outperformed the market with less volatility, according to research from Hartford Funds. So adding a few solid dividend growth stocks to your portfolio could provide a nice boost to your long-term returns.Here are three dividend growth stocks that could raise their dividends in January.Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) has raised its dividend for 15 straight years, typically announcing the new dividend payment with the release of its fourth-quarter earnings results. The company will release the results of its 2023 fourth quarter on Jan. 25.While Comcast sits on a ton of debt, about $95 billion, that's balanced by its massive cable business, which produces stable recurring revenue.Total dividend payments amounted to $3.6 billion over the first nine months of 2023, barely moving higher from the previous year thanks to Comcast's share repurchase program. Comcast bought back $7.8 billion worth of shares during the first three quarters. Combined, the two amount to practically all of its free cash flow.The dividend is protected by the aggressive share repurchases and strong free cash flow at Comcast. Therefore, investors should expect yet another dividend increase when the company announces its fourth-quarter results.Chevron (NYSE: CVX) has increased its dividend for 36 straight years, managing through tough economic environments, including the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic before that. That's largely owed to management's focus on keeping its balance sheet in tip-top form.The company keeps a relatively low debt level most of the time compared to its peers, and it keeps its capital expenditures in check. It's well positioned to generate strong free cash flow from its existing assets, and a plan to acquire Hess in an all-stock deal could provide a boost to earnings and free cash flow next year.Total dividend payments amounted to $8.5 billion through the first nine months of 2023, up slightly from $8.3 billion in 2022. Share repurchases accelerated to $11.5 billion, using up excess cash on the balance sheet while it works to turn around free cash flow growth. With expectations for lower capital expenditures and higher margins in the future, investors should expect a strong recovery in free cash flow generation.Investors should see yet another dividend increase when Chevron announces its fourth-quarter financial results.BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) has increased its dividend every year but one since initiating it in 2003. The lone year it didn't raise the dividend? 2009, following the Great Recession.BlackRock's balance sheet looks fantastic, with $7.1 billion in cash and $4.7 billion in unencumbered investments relative to about $7.9 billion in long-term debt. As an asset manager, BlackRock is more susceptible to market swings than other companies, so free cash flow isn't as consistent as in some other industries.Nonetheless, BlackRock's dividend is well protected. Around half of its capital return program currently goes toward share repurchases. That leaves plenty of room for the company to keep raising its dividend year after year as its assets under management grow due to asset price appreciation and continued inflows of new money.Investors should expect management to announce an increased annual dividend before the end of January if it doesn't announce with its fourth-quarter earnings release.Finding a great dividend growth stock requires more than just finding a company that's consistently raised its dividend. You need to be sure the company will be able to continue raising its dividend for years to come.These companies look well positioned to do just that, but not every company that's raised its dividend can afford to keep doing so. So be sure to dig into the company's financials and research the outlook for the future before diving in, no matter how many years a stock has increased its dividend.Should you invest $1,000 in Comcast right now?Before you buy stock in Comcast, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Comcast wasn't one of them.

It can help lower your lifetime taxes significantly. However it does come with a large up-front bill.While there's no way to avoid conversion taxes completely, you can restructure them to make this much more manageable. By staggering out your conversion or timing it for years in which you have low tax liability or portfolio losses, you can reduce the impact of a Roth IRA conversion.If you need help executing a strategy to minimize your taxes, speak to a financial advisor today.Traditional qualifying employer-sponsored retirement accounts have opposite tax treatments compared to Roth IRAs.Retirement accounts such as traditional IRAs, 401(k)s, and 403(b)s are called \"pre-tax\" accounts. This means that while you may enjoy a tax break on your contributions going into these plans, you’ll face full income taxes when you eventually make withdrawals. You effectively pay no income taxes on the money you put in but full income taxes on the money you take out.On the other hand, Roth IRAs are called \"post-tax\" accounts. While you cannot take a deduction for the money you contribute, you don't have to pay income taxes at all on your withdrawals. Effectively, you pay full income taxes on the money you put in but no income taxes on the money you take out.Since your portfolio gains will almost certainly exceed your contributions given enough time and the right allocations, a Roth IRA is one of the best tax-advantaged retirement accounts for most households. This is why many people like to take advantage of Roth IRA conversions – moving their money from a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA to take advantage of the long-term tax savings.There's a catch though. When you move money from an IRA into a Roth IRA, for instance, you must essentially make up for the initial deduction you took by paying income taxes on the full value of your conversion. In practice, this means that you add the value of a conversion to your taxable income for the year in which you took it. This can increase your taxes, sometimes by quite a lot depending on the size of your transfer.You cannot avoid paying taxes on this money, however you can reduce the impact of a conversion. Here are a few strategies to consider.A financial advisor can help you weigh the pros and cons of a Roth conversion in your personal situation.If you’re near retirement age, it’s important to note that you cannot make penalty-free withdrawals from a Roth IRA for five years after you open the account. So, take that into consideration when deciding on a conversion strategy.It may make sense to avoid converting everything all at once. Instead, you can convert a little bit at a time. By making the conversion in pieces, you may be able to keep your tax bracket lower over a series of years, rather than if you converted everything up front.The corollary to staggered conversion is tax bracket management. When you convert your IRA or 401(k) to a Roth IRA, you will add the value of this conversion to your taxable income for the year. If you're not careful, this can raise your AGI enough to push you into a new tax bracket. While this won't affect your taxes on income below the cutoff, you'll pay even more in taxes on any conversion money above the new bracket.It can be very useful to keep an eye on how a conversion will affect your taxes. Convert enough to maximize your current bracket, but not enough to push you into a higher one.It may also be helpful to consider that the longer you take to convert your IRA, the more time your portfolio will have to grow and the more you may ultimately have to move (and pay taxes on). You also could miss out on tax-free growth in the Roth during this time.Speak to a financial advisor to explore ways to maximize your retirement income and minimize taxes.When you take investment losses, you can offset investment gains down to $0. After that, you can use investment losses to offset up to $3,000 in taxable income per year, indefinitely, as well.This can be an excellent opportunity to do a limited Roth IRA conversion. By writing down up to $3,000 in capital gains losses, you can offset some of the increased taxable income that you will see from the IRA.Similarly, you can also time your conversion to unrealized losses in the stock market.When you make a Roth IRA conversion, you increase your taxable income by the entire amount converted. As a result, you're better off moving the smallest amount of money possible. This makes market downturns an opportunity to minimize your tax liability. Time your conversion to when your IRA portfolio loses value. A 10% market downturn means that you might move 10% less cash over to your Roth IRA, reducing the impact on your taxes. However, you’ll also be contributing less to the Roth than if the market was in better shape.A financial advisor can help you project your income and taxes in multiple scenarios.Finally, remember that the rules to many different programs are linked to your annual income. From student aid to Medicaid, tax credits and more, a vast number of different public and private entities base your eligibility on this or last year's taxable income.For the self employed, this is particularly essential. Your real, estimated and self-employment taxes are all based on your AGI, so a change in your taxed income can change several different areas of taxation.Make sure to look at any program or grant that you depend on before making a conversion, and structure your conversion to keep your income below any applicable caps. You don't want to roll your portfolio over just to discover that doing so made you ineligible for tuition assistance.A Roth IRA conversion is a very good long-term plan for most households, but it comes with a large tax bill attached. You cannot avoid paying those taxes, but you can structure your conversion to minimize its impact.Tax advantages are all well and good, but a Roth IRA is really only valuable if it delivers growth. Otherwise, you're saving taxes on money that never actually happened. So… what kind of return can you expect from a Roth IRA? A financial advisor can help you build a comprehensive retirement plan.

Here are the factors driving this trend and the pros and cons of following suit.Consider working with a financial advisor to create a retirement plan that fits your goals, risk profile and timeline.More People Claim Social Security Early42% of Americans said they plan to file for Social Security before their full retirement age while also continuing to work, according to a 2022 survey by the Nationwide Retirement Institute – up from 36% in 2021.Workers who’ve paid into the retirement system can claim their Social Security benefits as early as age 62, but that decision can result in a monthly benefit check that’s as much as 30% less than the payment they’d receive at full retirement age, which is between ages 66 and 67 depending on what year you were born. By waiting beyond longer to file, a retiree can increase their Social Security payment by 8% each year beyond the full retirement age they wait to file, topping out at 70 years.As of February 2023, the average monthly Social Security check among all retirees is $1,693.88, according to the agency. Meanwhile, the average check for a 62-year-old retiring this year would be $1,247.40, while the average payment at the full retirement age of 67 would be $1,782.Over a 20-year retirement, the monthly difference of $534.6 would add up to more than $128,000 in retirement income, not counting any cost-of-living increases. These adjustments increase benefits by a set percentage calculated each year to keep retirement income paced with inflation.Collecting benefits early isn’t always wrong, planners note. Many workers start taking Social Security benefits when they’re forced to retire because of corporate downsizing, age discrimination in hiring, illness or the need to care for a sick family member.The Break-Even PointWaiting to collect a higher benefit check later means the recipient is foregoing some cash flow. The “break-even” point – where the total benefits collected at full retirement are more than all the cash that could have been collected by starting early – usually comes somewhere around age 80, financial planners say.Using this year’s average benefit amounts, someone who starts collecting benefits at 62 would collect a total of more than $254,000 over 17 years before they would have collected slightly more by waiting to claim the higher full-retirement benefit. By the year 2040, the higher benefit amount for waiting would produce slightly more than $2,000 in additional total cash (unadjusted for inflation).Tax ConsiderationsSocial Security benefits themselves aren’t taxable, but a downside of receiving Social Security payments early is that many of the beneficiaries will continue to work, which can make some or even much of their benefits taxable. In fact, that tax can apply to anyone collecting benefits who receives additional income.A single tax filer receiving Social Security payments who makes more than $25,000 of what the IRS calls “combined income” will be taxed on 50% of his or her benefits, up to a limit of $34,000 in income. At that point, the tax apply to 85% of their benefits. The limits for joint tax filers are $32,000 and $44,000, respectively. Combined income is a taxpayer’s adjusted gross income, plus nontaxable interest income from bonds and half of their Social Security benefits.Bottom lineThe number of workers claiming Social Security early in their 60s is increasing, which may be due to a multitude of reasons. Everyone’s retirement path is different, so it’s important to calculate your needs and apply your Social Security accordingly. And if you continue to work while receiving benefits remember to estimate your tax penalty.Tips on Retirement PlanningDeciding when to claim Social Security is only one part of retirement planning. A financial advisor can help you see and understand all the variables that go into a retirement plan. If you don’t have a financial advisor yet, finding one doesn’t have to be hard.

Until now,\" he added.Spence warned that the ballooning debt pile could force the government to raise taxes, fuel further bond sell-offs, and force the Federal Reserve to lock in higher interest rates.\"Slower economic growth also could be expected, given that government spending would need to be re-routed to debt service,\" he added. \"For investors, this could lead to lower stock market returns over time, given the strong long-term correlation between GDP growth and market returns.\"This article was originally published on October 20, 2023.Read the original article on Business Insider"}

He made the unusual move to begin investing the publisher and legal-software provider's excess cash into other companies' stocks at the height of the financial crisis.\"In February 2009, the Company took advantage of near-panic selling in the stock market and redeployed some of its cash, which had been invested in Treasury securities and was generating only nominal interest, to purchase the common stock of two Fortune 200 companies and certain bonds of a third,\" Daily Journal disclosed in its annual report that year.The publisher initially deployed $20.4 million, a huge bet for a company that only earned $40 million in total revenues and $12 million in operating income that year. The wager quickly paid off; it racked up $34 million in unrealized gains by September as stocks rallied.Daily Journal made sure to emphasize in its financial reports since then that Munger was guiding its investment decisions. It credited his  \"judgment and suggestions\" and said he played an \"important role\" in monitoring its portfolio and placing additional bets.Munger, who's called excessive diversification the enemy of exceptional returns, limited Daily Journal's stock portfolio to eight companies or fewer during his roughly 13 years running it. By investing in the likes of Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Tesla-rival BYD, he grew the value of the publisher's stockholdings to $303 million as of September 30 this year, including $138 million in unrealized gains. For context, Daily Journal earned about $68 million of revenue and $7 million in operating income last financial year.The late investor's biggest winner at Daily Journal was likely BYD. It cashed out $50 million of the electric-vehicle maker's stock in late 2021, realizing a 15-fold return on a $3.3 million investment.It's not surprising to see Daily Journal manage its shareholders' future expectations, now that it no longer has one of the best investors in history picking its stocks. But the publisher's comments underscore the immense impact that Munger had on a business that's far smaller and less famous than Berkshire.Read the original article on Business Insider"}

Since tumbling into a bear market in 2022, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed to new all-time highs, while the growth-fueled Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) has bounced in the neighborhood of 50% off of its lows.Interestingly, though, the index most responsible for lifting the broader market to new heights in 2021 is still languishing below its record high. As of the closing bell on Dec. 27, the Nasdaq Composite remained 6% shy of its high-water mark.While this decline might be disappointing to short-term traders, it's music to the ears of long-term-minded investors. That's because notable dips in the Nasdaq Composite of any form have historically represented an opportunity to buy high-quality growth stocks at a discount.What follows are four unsurpassed growth stocks you'll regret not buying in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market dip.The first unrivaled growth stock you'll be kicking yourself for not adding with the Nasdaq Composite still recovering from the 2022 bear market is none other than e-commerce leader Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Although there's some concern that Amazon could struggle if the U.S. economy weakens in 2024, the segments that matter most for this juggernaut are still firing on all cylinders.Most consumers are familiar with Amazon because of its world-leading online marketplace. In 2022, Insider Intelligence (formerly known as eMarketer) estimated that Amazon brought in nearly 40% of all online retail sales in the United States. However, online retail sales yield razor-thin margins. While its online marketplace is a big-time revenue producer, Amazon's operating cash flow and income are predominantly derived from its ancillary segments.None of these divisions is more important than Amazon Web Services (AWS). According to estimates from tech-analysis company Canalys, AWS accounted for 31% of global cloud infrastructure service share in the September-ended quarter. Enterprise spending on cloud infrastructure is still very early in its ramp, which suggests sustained double-digit growth is likely throughout the decade (if not beyond). AWS is consistently responsible for 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income despite the fact that it only accounts for about a sixth of the company's net sales.Amazon's subscription services and advertising services segments are important cash flow drivers, too. Amazon has signed up more than 200 million people globally to a Prime subscription. Further, its online marketplace is attracting more than 2 billion people to its site each month. That's a recipe for strong ad-pricing power with merchants.Though Amazon isn't inexpensive from a traditional price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio standpoint, it's historically cheap relative to its future cash flow. Since the company reinvests most of its cash flow back into its business, this price-to-cash-flow metric is far more telling of how cheap Amazon stock is right now.A second unsurpassed growth stock you'll regret not buying in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market decline is small-cap furniture stock Lovesac (NASDAQ: LOVE). While recessionary fears have the potential to weigh down the traditionally stodgy furniture industry, Lovesac's out-of-the-box innovations show it's not like its brick-and-mortar peers.The differentiation between Lovesac and every other furniture company is readily apparent in its products. \"Sactionals\" -- modular couches that can be rearranged to fit most living spaces -- account for just shy of 90% of Lovesac's net sales. Sactionals have more than 200 different cover choices, and the yarn used in their production is derived entirely from recycled plastic water bottles. It's worth noting that sactionals have an abundance of upgrade options available, too, including built-in surround sound and wireless charging stations.As you may have guessed, this differentiation does make sactionals costlier than a traditional sofa or sectional couch. But this priciness is actually a competitive advantage for the company. It's specifically targeting middle- and upper-income consumers who are less likely to alter their buying habits during economic downturns.Lovesac's omnichannel sales platform is another key to its success. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Lovesac was able to pivot its sales online easily. While it does have a physical presence in 40 U.S. states, it hedges its brick-and-mortar sales with popup showrooms, brand-name partnerships, and direct-to-consumer sales. This strategy lowers its overhead expenses and lifts its operating margin.Considering its low double-digit annual sales growth, Lovesac looks like quite the bargain at 12 times forward-year earnings.The third top-notch growth stock you'll regret not scooping up in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market drop is media company Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS). Though the COVID-19 pandemic clobbered multiple facets of Disney's operations, such as its theme parks and film division, numerous catalysts are now set to act as tailwinds.To build on the obvious, Walt Disney should see a steady rebound in its film entertainment division and theme park operations as life returns to normal and attendance picks up. These bread-and-butter segments, which are fueled by Disney's exceptionally valuable brand and strong pricing power, can sustain double-digit earnings growth over the next five years.Even more important, Walt Disney's storytelling and engagement simply can't be duplicated by other companies. Though there are other theme parks to attend and movies to watch, they don't have the characters, depth of story, or emotional attachment factor that Walt Disney's theme parks and movies have brought to the table for decades. Consumers will willingly pay a premium for the Disney experience.Another catalyst for Walt Disney is the expected improvement in the company's streaming operations. Increasing monthly subscription prices on its various service tiers will bring in additional revenue that, along with mindful cost-cutting, should shift this segment to profitability toward the end of fiscal 2024.A forward P/E ratio of 17 for an industry leader that's expected to deliver annualized earnings growth of 15.4% over the next five years is a screaming bargain.The fourth unsurpassed growth stock you'll regret not buying in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market dip is ultra-popular coffee chain Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX). Although inflation and COVID-19 were both big-time nemeses for Starbucks in 2022, there is now a laundry list of catalysts acting as a tailwind.Similar to Walt Disney, Starbucks is enjoying favorable year-over-year operating performance comparisons as it moves beyond the worst of the pandemic. This is especially true in China, where Starbucks operates more than 6,800 stores as of Oct. 1, 2023. China abandoned its stringent \"zero-COVID\" mitigation strategy in December 2022, which means we're still witnessing a healthy ramp in sales as life returns to normal.Something very clearly working in Starbucks' favor is the loyalty of its customer base. Speaking as someone who's only missed his daily trip to Starbucks on a handful of occasions over the past 30 years, the company's customers tend to be willing to absorb price hikes above and beyond the rate of inflation. Starbucks closed out fiscal 2023 (ended Oct. 1) with 32.6 million active Rewards Members. These Rewards Members average bigger tickets than non-Rewards customers, and they're more likely to use mobile ordering, which expedites servicing times.Furthermore, Starbucks made big changes to its drive-thru ordering system during the pandemic that are now paying dividends. It added video to its ordering boards to personalize the drive-thru experience, as well as focused on food and drink pairings to drive high-margin items and expedite the ordering process.While Starbucks' stock might not appear cheap at 20 times forward-year earnings, it certainly is once you factor in its phenomenal pricing power, loyal customer base, and expected annualized earnings growth of 15.5% over the next five years.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Over the past three years, China’s EV exports have jumped 851%, the New York Times reported in October.But in the U.S., tariffs affecting China’s EV makers have made it nearly impossible for them to compete against vehicles made domestically or imported from friendly countries. That doesn’t mean they aren’t planning an assault, however: Chinese EV makers are instead focusing on another North American market, one that could prove to be a stepping stone into the U.S.: Mexico.South of the border, sales of affordable Chinese-made EVs are booming. According to the Mexican Association of Automotive Distributors, Mexico’s imports of Chinese cars (both EVs and traditional ones) increased 62.6% during the first eight months of this year compared to the same period last year.More worrying for U.S. automakers, several Chinese EV makers plan to build factories south of the border. That’s concerning because Mexico has a free trade agreement with the U.S. and Canada (the USMCA). Among the Chinese EV makers scouting locations in Mexico are BYD, Chery, and MG, reports the Financial Times.Especially formidable is BYD, backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and poised to overtake Tesla as the world’s biggest EV seller. It owns the entire supply chain of its EV batteries, from the raw materials to the finished battery packs. Other Chinese EV makers have similar supply-chain advantages, to varying degrees, giving them a big cost advantage.Earlier this month, the U.S. government, intent on building up the domestic EV supply chain, released new rules making it harder for vehicles with battery components made by a \"foreign entity of concern”—meaning companies in China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea—to qualify for a $7,500 tax break granted to EV buyers under the Inflation Reduction Act.Currently in the U.S., made-in-China EVs are subject to a 25% tariff, which is atop a 2.5% tariff on imported cars. That’s prevented them from making significant inroads. But manufacturing in Mexico could change the equation.Of course, American and European companies have long manufactured cars and parts in Mexico for export to the U.S. and Canada, taking advantage of lower labor costs and the free trade agreement. Under the agreement, automakers can import cars into the U.S. duty free, as long as three-quarters of each vehicle’s parts were built in North America.Elon Musk’s Tesla also has its eyes in Mexico, announcing in March that it would produce significantly more affordable EVs than those in its current lineup in Monterrey, where it will build its fifth factory. (Musk confirmed in October that plans for the plant are still on after rumors of cancellation.)Read More: After Elon Musk predicts leading carmakers will be Chinese, smartphone giant Xiaomi unveils first EV and vows to be in ‘world’s top 5’But China’s moves in Mexico have rattled nerves in Detroit and Washington, D.C.Last month, House lawmakers warned U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai in a letter about China’s “industrial strategy to dominate the global automobile market\" and its EV makers “gaining a backdoor to the U.S. market through our key trading partners.”The lawmakers argued that existing tariffs on made-in-China cars should be maintained and even increased, and warned about a “coming wave” of Chinese vehicles that “will be exported from our other trading partners, such as Mexico.”Mexico isn’t the only country with a U.S. free trade agreement that Chinese carmakers want to leverage. Another is South Korea, where Polestar—a luxury EV brand owned by China’s Geely—will manufacture its Polestar 4 SUV in 2025 at a Renault factory in Busan. That vehicle will avoid the 27.5% U.S. tariff imposed on the made-in-China Polestar 2. Polestar was previously owned by Volvo, which is now owned by Geely. Polestar also plans to build its Polestar 3 at a Volvo factory in South Carolina, which would allow it to also avoid tariffs.“We are concerned by how the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is preparing to flood the United States and global markets with automobiles, particularly electric vehicles (EV), propped up by massive subsidies and long-standing localization and other discriminatory policies employed by the PRC,” the lawmakers wrote. “Indeed, PRC automakers BYD, Chery, and SAIC Motors have already established themselves in Mexico.”Earlier this year, Ford Motor executive chairman Bill Ford Jr. warned that U.S. automakers are “not quite yet ready” to compete with Chinese rivals on EVs. “They developed very quickly, and they’ve developed them in large scale, and now they are exporting,” he told CNN in June. “They are not here, but they will come here we think at some point and we need to be ready, and we’re getting ready.”Companies further north are similarly concerned. Flavio Volpe, president of Canada’s Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association, told The Globe and Mail last month that he worries about investments in Mexico’s auto industry by Chinese firms, which appear designed to get around tariffs.“All these Chinese companies have access to cheap capital, benefit from a central plan, and are part of a wider geopolitical objective to weaken the North American base,” he said. “Canadian suppliers are only just trying to be profitable and solvent in a free market.”Made-in-China EVs are sold in more than 100 countries, and the U.S. is the only market where they “have not yet really begun a big assault,” ZoZo Go CEO Michael Dunne, whose advisory firm specializes in the Chinese EV industry, told the Wall Street Journal.With the U.S. largely protecting itself from this onslaught so far, the big question now is what happens in Mexico in the years ahead.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com"}

{"date": "2023-12-31-11-06", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/forget-medical-properties-trust-2-110000045.html", "text_blocks": "Professional gamblers will tell you that chasing losses can lead to financial ruin. Basically, chasing losses happens when someone tries to recoup losses quickly by making increasingly larger bets, assuming that \"luck\" must eventually change. The same theory applies to investing. Sometimes, investors continue to put money into the same stock as it falls, assuming it must eventually rebound. Many never do. Although still dicey, this strategy is better suited to the highest-quality companies, for example, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). Doing it with the real estate investment trust (REIT) Medical Properties Trust (NYSE: MPW) is perilous.Medical Properties Trust is hugely popular with retail investors and heavily covered by analysts that cater to this crowd. Part of the allure is its high yield, currently almost 18%. But, as I have written in detail here, dividend growth is often much better for investors than high yields. Stocks often have high yields because they are lower quality or riskier. This causes the stock price to drop, and the market demands a yield much higher than average to own it. As shown below, Medical Properties Trust has lost 75% of investors' money since the beginning of 2022, even when the massive yield is included.The problems with this REIT are many, including reliance on a few tenants, a major tenant with financial issues, and needing to sell off assets to service its debt. The dividend was cut nearly in half in August.There are better dividend options. Here are two to consider.Some of the most famous properties in the world line the Las Vegas Strip, like Caesars Palace, MGM Grand, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and many more. Companies such as Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ: CZR) and MGM Resorts (NYSE: MGM) don't own them. Instead, the real estate investment trust Vici Properties (NYSE: VICI) does. Vici also owns other famous properties, like Chelsea Piers in New York. It holds 92 properties in 26 states and one Canadian province.One advantage to being the landlord is that revenue is consistent despite economic challenges. Vici collected 100% of rents while many casinos were closed during the pandemic of 2020. It even raised the dividend during this time. The dividend has been increased every year since the trust's inception in 2018 and yields more than 5% now. Its recent growth rate tops many in the industry, as shown below.The lease agreements between Vici and its tenants are long, with an average of 42 years, so it doesn't have the same worries about occupancy that a typical office building or shopping center REIT might. Most leases are also tied to inflation; rents increase along with the consumer price index (CPI). This is critical for keeping up with rising prices and providing investors with an increasing dividend.Unlike MPW, Vici isn't selling assets. It is buying more and expanding outside gaming to include golf resorts, bowling alleys, lodging, and international opportunities. The expansion adds to Vici's revenue and boosts its ability to continue its industry-leading dividend growth rate. Vici is an excellent option for dividend investors.Perhaps you aren't a dividend investor, or you are but want to diversify a bit. Booking Holdings (NASDAQ: BKNG) deserves a look. Booking is highly profitable and produces tons of free cash flow (FCF) -- or cash flow after business investments and capital expenditures -- but it uses it differently than dividend stocks.Booking is the world's largest online travel booking service and owns brands like Booking.com, Priceline, KAYAK, and OpenTable. It also competes with Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) for short-term rental bookings. However, Booking focuses on rentals available through property managers rather than individual hosts.Booking's revenue and free cash flow dipped during the pandemic due to the travel slowdown but rebounded to record levels, as shown below.Booking can generate this huge 38% FCF margin because the business is very capital-light, meaning it doesn't spend much capital on property and equipment (capital expenditures, also known as capex). Capex doesn't appear on the income statement as an expense, but it reduces the cash available to issue dividends, invest in growth, or repurchase stock.Through the third quarter of 2023, only $251 million, or 1.5% of revenue, was used for capex. This frees up money that the company is using to repurchase its stock. Many investors (including me!) prefer it when companies repurchase stock rather than pay a dividend because stock repurchases are not taxable income for shareholders. The repurchases reduce the number of shares available, increasing the value of the remaining shares outstanding. Booking has spent $14.5 billion since January 2022 on buybacks, which reduced the shares count by 13%.Booking's stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25. Historically, it's difficult to judge this since the ratios went wonky when the pandemic decimated earnings. However, it is lower than Expedia (NASDAQ: EXPE) and higher than Airbnb. I believe the valuation is fair given Booking's profitability, rising revenue, and exceptional free cash flow. Still, it is wise to use dollar-cost averaging, given the market's rise to near-record levels.Medical Properties Trust hasn't been kind to investors, unfortunately. Before throwing good money after bad, consider alternatives like Vici Properties and Booking Holdings.Should you invest $1,000 in Vici Properties right now?Before you buy stock in Vici Properties, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Vici Properties wasn't one of them.

{"date": "2023-12-31-11-06", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/stock-market-near-time-high-122000916.html", "text_blocks": "The S&P 500 has climbed about 24% in 2023, hovering right around its all-time high. The Nasdaq Composite is up 44%, although the tech-heavy index still has some ground to cover before it starts carving out new all-time highs of its own.This rally has made stocks generally more expensive, but there are still some good deals for investors looking for a bargain. Here's why investors should consider International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) and DigitalOcean (NYSE: DOCN) as 2023 comes to a close.A start-up building something from scratch is free to run all its workloads on public clouds and use whatever generative artificial intelligence (AI) service it wants. But for a large enterprise that's been around for decades or longer, things are more complicated.A large, storied company may be running workloads on a mix of its own hardware and public cloud platforms. It may depend on legacy software or have on-premise databases that back mission-critical processes. And with reams of proprietary and customer data, sending that to an untrusted AI service is a recipe for disaster.IBM plays the role of trusted advisor to enterprises looking to modernize their infrastructures and adopt AI technology. Using its software platforms and its vast consulting business, IBM provides solutions for clients that cut costs, reduce complexity, and boost productivity. In the AI realm, IBM's watsonx platform enables clients to deploy cutting-edge AI models while minimizing compliance, regulatory, and data privacy concerns.IBM's revenue should grow by 3% to 5% this year excluding the impact of currency, and the company plans to generate about $10.5 billion of free cash flow. With a market capitalization closing in on $150 billion, IBM trades at a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 14.While IBM stock has risen about 16% in 2023, it remains well below its all-time high reached more than a decade ago. If the company can produce consistent revenue and free-cash-flow growth in the years ahead, the market may finally be convinced that IBM's turnaround is for real. A combination of free-cash-flow growth and a loftier valuation multiple should then drive solid returns for investors.The world's biggest companies are almost certain to use Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or another major platform for their cloud computing needs. With complex requirements and armies of IT workers, navigating a vast and complicated cloud platform isn't an issue.For individual developers and small businesses, it's a different story. Simplicity is valuable to a sizable chunk of the cloud computing market. A small business may only need a virtual server and a database. With AWS and the other major cloud platforms having such steep learning curves, the upfront costs of using those platforms are high.DigitalOcean keeps its platform simple, in more ways than one. The company's catalog of services is short, and it's been increasingly branching out into managed cloud services that remove much of the administrative burden for developers. Pricing is also simple and predictable, with little chance of a surprise cloud bill when something goes awry.DigitalOcean is facing some headwinds as customers pull back on spending, but recent acquisitions set the stage for long-term growth. The acquisition of Cloudways brought high-value customers and managed cloud servers to DigitalOcean's platform, and the acquisition of Paperspace gives the company a user-friendly AI platform.DigitalOcean's growth has slowed, but the company is churning out an increasing amount of cash. Free cash flow should work out to 21% to 22% of revenue in 2023, or about $150 million. With DigitalOcean valued at about $3.2 billion, the price-to-free-cash-flow ratio sits at 21.Given that DigitalOcean expects its total addressable market to more than double to $195 billion by 2026, that valuation seems not only reasonable, but downright cheap. DigitalOcean's growth rate in the near term may be volatile, but the company should be capable of double-digit annual revenue growth for many years to come.Should you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?Before you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and International Business Machines wasn't one of them.

{"date": "2023-12-31-11-06", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/want-1-million-retirement-invest-105000944.html", "text_blocks": "The recipe for retiring comfortably requires three key ingredients. First, you must have money to invest, of course. Second, you need assets that will grow your money. Third, you need time to allow your investments to grow.The more money you have to invest, the less time you'll need to build a solid nest egg -- and vice versa. But the right assets can help tremendously. Want $1 million in retirement? Invest $300,000 in these three stocks and wait a decade.By my calculations, it will take a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.8% to turn $300,000 into $1 million over the next 10 years. I think that investing one-third of that upfront amount in Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEP) (NYSE: BEPC) should get you a long way toward achieving that goal.Brookfield Renewable's name hints at what the company does. It's a leading provider of renewable energy with hydroelectric, wind, solar, distributed generation, and storage facilities across the world.The company is confident that it will be able to deliver total returns of between 12% and 15% per year over the long term. Brookfield Renewable doesn't even need to hit the midpoint of that range to meet our required CAGR. But can the company pull it off? I think so.It's no secret that the demand for renewable energy is soaring. Countries and major corporations have set ambitious carbon reduction targets. More electricity will be needed with the rising adoption of electric vehicles. Brookfield Renewable is ready to help meet that demand with its large and growing development pipeline.Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) might seem to be an odd choice for our list. It's already the second-largest company in the world, with a market cap of nearly $2.8 trillion. If Microsoft grows by our 12.8% CAGR target over the next decade, it will be worth roughly $9.3 trillion.I nonetheless think that investing $100,000 of the initial $300,000 in Microsoft and waiting 10 years could pay off handsomely. And I can sum up my rationale in two words: artificial intelligence (AI).Arguably, no other company is in a better position to profit from the AI boom than Microsoft. The tech giant owns a large stake in ChatGPT developer OpenAI. Microsoft has integrated OpenAI's GPT-4 throughout its product lineup. As a major software developer, the company is also poised to benefit from productivity improvement by using AI.Several AI leaders (including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman) predict that artificial general intelligence (AGI) could be developed within the next decade. If they're right, any company that is at the forefront of AGI should be wildly attractive to investors. I'd bet that Microsoft will be one of them.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) commands a monopoly in treating the underlying cause of the rare genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). But CF isn't the main reason why investing the final one-third of an initial $300,000 and waiting 10 years can help you retire as a millionaire.This big biotech is rapidly expanding beyond CF. Vertex has already won U.S. approval for Casgevy to treat (and effectively curing) sickle cell disease. It awaits a second approval decision for the gene-editing therapy in treating transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. The consensus projection for Casgevy's peak annual sales is around $2.2 billion, but some analysts think it could make a lot more than that.Vertex has high hopes for its experimental non-opioid pain drug VX-548. The company plans to report results from three late-stage studies in early 2024. It's evaluating inaxaplin in a pivotal clinical study targeting APOL1-mediated kidney disease, which affects more patients than CF. Vertex's pipeline also features multiple programs in early-stage testing that hold the potential to cure type 1 diabetes.CF will still be important to Vertex's fortunes, though. The biotech is set to soon announce results from late-stage studies of a new triple-drug combo that could be its most powerful and most profitable CF therapy yet.I believe that investing $300,000 spread equally across Brookfield Renewable, Microsoft, and Vertex and waiting a decade truly can help you retire with $1 million. However, there are always risks with investing in stocks that can cause problems.The growth in renewable energy could be slower than many predict and hobble Brookfield Renewable's prospects. AI breakthroughs could be fewer and farther between in the coming years, holding back Microsoft. Vertex could experience major pipeline setbacks.Still, you can't expect to obtain significant returns without taking on some risk. I think that Brookfield Renewable, Microsoft, and Vertex offer attractive risk-reward profiles for aggressive investors.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

If you’re already taking Social Security, you might be wondering if it’s possible to switch to a spousal benefit later. The answer depends on whether your spouse is receiving Social Security benefits yet.A financial advisor can help you figure out what you qualify for and when the best time is for you to start taking benefits as part of your full retirement plan.How Do Social Security Spousal Benefits Work?Calculating Social Security benefits as a married couple is a bit different than doing it as a single person. When someone files for Social Security benefits, their spouse may be able to claim a spousal benefit. The benefit is based on their spouse’s contributions to Social Security and is capped at 50% of their benefit amount at full retirement age. For example, if they were to receive $2,200 per month at full retirement age, their spousal benefit would max out at $1,100 per month.In order to receive spousal Social Security benefits, you must:Be at least 62, the earliest age at which you can receive Social Security benefits ORBe a caretaker for a child under age 16 or a child who’s receiving Social Security disability benefitsBe married for at least one year to someone who has filed for their retirement benefitsWhen you apply for spousal benefits, the Social Security Administration calculates your benefits based on your own work and earnings record as well. If you’re eligible to receive your retirement benefit as well as spousal benefits, then you’d get the higher of the two.If your spouse hasn’t filed for retirement yet, then you can’t get spousal benefits. You can, however, file for your own retirement benefits if you’re at least 62 years old.Taking Social Security at age 62 will reduce your benefit amount, below the amount you’d be entitled to if you had waited until you reached full retirement age. Delaying benefits until age 70, on the other hand, increases your benefit amount.If you’re claiming spousal benefits and filing before your full retirement age, then your benefit amount would be roughly 30% instead of 50%. The only exception is if you’re claiming spousal benefits and you’re a caretaker for a child under 16 or a child with disabilities.Can I Switch My Social Security Benefit to a Spousal Benefit?Switching from your regular retirement benefit to a spousal benefit is something you might be interested in if you’re hoping to maximize Social Security benefits. Whether you can make this switch is determined by whether your spouse is already receiving benefits.If your spouse is not receiving any retirement benefits yet, then you could technically take your regular Social Security benefit as early as age 62. When your spouse files for their benefit later you could switch to spousal benefits. That could potentially increase the total amount of benefits you receive as a couple if they’re waiting until age 70 to start taking benefits.What if your spouse is already receiving their Social Security benefits? In that situation, the deemed filing rule applies. That rule dictates that when someone applies for their regular retirement benefit, they’re also approved for spousal benefits if they’re entitled to receive them. So again, you’d get the higher amount of the two.If you’re ready to be matched with local advisors that can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.Deemed Filing and Spousal BenefitsThe Social Security Administration implemented the deemed filing rule to prevent double-dipping. Prior to the rule, if spousal benefits were higher than an individual benefit, the person could receive a combination of benefits equal to the higher benefit. Deemed filing keeps spouses from receiving one type of retirement benefit while also benefiting from delaying another type of benefit.There are some exceptions to this rule, which would still allow you to apply for spousal benefits independent of your own retirement benefit. You might be eligible for an exception if you:Were born before January 2, 1954Are caring for a child under 16 or a child with disabilitiesAre eligible for Social Security disability benefitsIf you’ve already taken your retirement benefits and your spouse is receiving a spousal benefit, they can opt to switch over to their retirement benefit instead if they were born before January 2, 1954. In that situation, you could then apply for an additional spousal benefit on top of your regular benefit once their benefits kick in.When Should You Claim Spousal Benefits?Timing matters when deciding when to claim spousal benefits. Again, taking benefits before full retirement age can reduce the number of benefits that you’re eligible to receive. However, delaying spousal benefits beyond full retirement age won’t increase the benefit amount, the way that it would regular retirement benefits.When deciding how to time spousal benefits or retirement benefits, it helps to look at the bigger picture and consider:Life expectancies and how long you and your spouse anticipate relying on Social Security benefitsHealth and the possibility of one or both of you needing long-term care at some pointOther income sources, including investments, a 401(k) or IRA or money earned from part-time work or side jobsRetirement budget and estimated expensesLiving longer, for example, might make delaying Social Security benefits more attractive. On the other hand, if you don’t have sufficient savings and investments then you might need the additional income that Social Security can provide sooner rather than later.If you’re confused about when to take spousal benefits or whether you can switch your retirement benefit to spousal benefits, talking to a financial advisor can help. An advisor who’s well-versed in Social Security planning can help you to decide on the right time to claim those benefits.The Bottom LineIt’s possible to switch your Social Security retirement benefit to spousal benefits if your spouse hasn’t filed yet. Whether it makes sense to do so can depend on your current ages and the ages at which each of you filed for benefits.As a general rule of thumb, the longer you can delay filing for Social Security the better, as it can result in a larger benefit amount.Retirement Planning TipsConsider talking to your financial advisor about switching from your retirement benefit to spousal benefits if your spouse has plans to claim their own benefits. If you don’t have a financial advisor yet, finding one doesn’t have to be difficult.

Deciding when to tap into each income stream can affect your tax situation so it’s important to understand the best order for drawing down assets. An advisor can also offer advice on how to claim Social Security benefits as an ex-spouse if you’re now divorced.©iStock.com/dragana991, ©iStock.com/RainStar, ©iStock.com/Jelena StanojkovicThe post Rules for Switching Social Security Benefits appeared first on SmartAsset Blog."}
