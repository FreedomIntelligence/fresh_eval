The shrine covers a large part of Mt. Sanage. The 629-meter mountain is thought to have been worshiped as the abode of the divine for millennia. The shrine consists of the main complex at the southern foot of the mountain and the Higashinomiya (Eastern Shrine) and Nishinomiya (Western Shrine) shrines higher up on the slopes.\n\nThe shrine is dedicated to Prince Ousu, the shrine‚Äôs main deity. In mythology, Ousu was the twin brother of Yamato Takeru, a legendary warrior prince and one of Japan‚Äôs most popular folk heroes. It was once believed that one twin would always be born right-handed and the other left-handed.  The left-handed scythe came to symbolize Ousu and is seen through the shrine. It is said he was an eager clearer of the wilderness for cultivation."}

Both the bulbs you see here are twisting but they do not want to come out almost as if something is connected to them on the inside. Also I thought these were h11 or 9005 but the new headlights i bought do not fit the connecters in the pic. h11 seems just ever so slightly big or the connecter seems to be just to small to fit into an h11 led bulb. Also tested the new bulb on my fog lights which I know for sure are h11s and they fit and worked perfectly. One of my headlights aren't working and I have no idea what kind of socket this is or how to even remove the bulbs! Please help!! Also I have the check engine light on now after fiddling with both the headlight connectors."}
