For the 1785 massacre in Ohio, see Gnadenhutten massacre.\nTobias Conrad Lotter's 1756 map of Eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey depicting Gnadenhütten, left of the map's center.\n\nThe Gnadenhütten massacre was an attack during the French and Indian War in which Native allies of the French killed 11 Moravian missionaries at Gnadenhütten, Pennsylvania (modern day Lehighton, Pennsylvania) on 24 November 1755. They destroyed the mission village,[2] and only four of the sixteen residents escaped.[3] Following the attack, Benjamin Franklin was commissioned by the Pennsylvania Provincial Council to construct forts in the area, and in other parts of the Province of Pennsylvania, to defend against Native American attacks, which were becoming increasingly frequent due to the French and Indian War.[4]: 241–43 \n\nBackground[edit]\n\nMoravian missionaries first established a mission at Friedenshütten (\"Tents of Peace\"),[5]: 92–93  near Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in 1744, but in 1745 decided to move some distance northwest of Bethlehem, to a site they named Gnadenhütten (\"Tents of Grace,\" often written Gnadenhuetten and sometimes referred to as \"Gnadenhütten on the Mahoney\" to distinguish it from Gnadenhutten in Ohio), near the junction of the Mahoning Creek and Lehigh River.[6]: 50 [7] The new community grew rapidly, and in 1751 the missionaries were able to convert 61 residents from a nearby Lenape village called Meniolagameka. The missionaries began translating hymns and \"several parts of the Scriptures\" into the Mohican language and the Mohawk language.[5]: 96–98  A nearby plot of land was purchased and planted with crops, and a sawmill and a gristmill were built in 1747.[8]: 371  The community was visited by Bishop August Gottlieb Spangenberg, Bishop John F. Cammerhoff, David Zeisberger, and Christian Frederick Post. By May 1749, over 500 Native American converts were attending church services in Gnadenhütten.[5]: 98–110 [1]\n\nIn 1752, representatives from the Nanticokes and Shawnee came to Gnadenhütten \"to establish a covenant with the Brethren.\"[5]: 116  Secretly, however, contact was made with Native American converts living in the community, and they were advised to move to Wyomick (Wyoming, Pennsylvania), as plans were being made, by Indians sympathetic to the French, to attack Gnadenhütten. In April 1754, 65 converts moved to Wyomick. Concerned for their safety, another 49 Lenape converts moved to Gnadenhütten from the village of Meniolagameka. In June 1755, most of the community of Gnadenhütten relocated to \"New Gnadenhütten,\" to the north of the Lehigh River, although many of the Lenape and Mohican converts remained south of the river.[5]: 121–22 [8]: 372 \n\nFollowing General Edward Braddock's defeat on 9 July 1755 at the Battle of the Monongahela, Pennsylvania was left without a professional military force.[9] Lenape chiefs Shingas and Captain Jacobs launched dozens of Shawnee and Delaware raids against British colonial settlements,[10] killing and capturing hundreds of colonists and destroying settlements across western and central Pennsylvania.[11] In October and early November 1755, the communities of Penn's Creek and Great Cove were attacked and destroyed by Lenape and Shawnee warriors.[12]\n\nDuring 1755, the Shawnee living in Wyomick had been affected by hunger, as game was becoming scarce due to overhunting. Gnadenhütten was also affected by food shortages after a May frost devastated the wheat crop, and the Moravians had to rely on a hundred bushels of corn sent from Philadelphia, however \"deserters from the Moravian Indian congregation,\" who had moved to Wyomick, reported that there was \"good living at Gnadenhuetten and abundant food to be had by all.\"[13]: 299–300  This may have been a contributing motivation for the attack.\n\nMassacre[edit]\n\nThe attack on Gnadenhütten was initiated late in the evening on 24 November, when about a dozen warriors surrounded a mission house in which 16 people lived:\n\n\"The family, being at supper, heard an uncommon barking of dogs, upon which brother Senseman sent out at the back door to see what was the matter. On the report of a gun, several ran together to open the house-door. Here the Indians stood with their pieces pointed towards the door, and, firing immediately upon its being opened, Martin Nitschman was instantly killed. His wife and some others were wounded, but fled with the rest upstairs into the garret, and barricaded the door with bedsteads. Brother Partsch escaped by jumping out of a back window. Brother Worbas, who was ill in bed in a house adjoining, jumped likewise out of a back window and escaped, though the enemies had placed a guard before his door. Meanwhile the savages pursued those who had taken refuge in the garret, and strove hard to burst the door open; but, finding it too well secured, they set fire to the house, which was soon in flames. A boy...up on the flaming roof, ventured to leap off, and escaped;...Sister Partsch, seeing this, took courage and leaped likewise from the burning roof...Brother Fabricius then leaped also off the roof, but before he could escape was perceived by the Indians, and instantly wounded by two balls. He was the only one whom they seized upon alive and, having dispatched him with their hatchets, took his scalp, and left him dead upon the ground. The rest were all burnt alive...The house being consumed, the murderers set fire to the barns and stables, by which all the corn, hay and cattle were destroyed. Then they divided the spoils, soaked some bread in milk, made a hearty meal, and departed.\"[14][15]: 231–32 \n\nAn article in the Pennsylvania Gazette of 4 December reports that the Shawnee attackers were only \"about twelve in number,\" and that five people died in the burning house. A sixth man was killed trying to escape. A boy escaped by jumping from a window, and another man had left the house immediately prior to the attack, having gone to lock the chapel door, and was unharmed.[16] Altogether, eleven missionaries are reported to have died.[1]\n\nNone of the Native American converts were harmed,[1] however they prepared to attack the assailants until a missionary told them to flee instead.[14] David Zeisberger, who was on his way from Bethlehem to Gnadenhütten, heard the shooting from a distance, initially thought nothing of it,[1] until he observed the house in flames. He alerted the militia commander in Bethlehem, but as they had no idea how many attackers they were facing, they chose to wait until daylight to investigate.[14]\n\nSusanna Nitschman, Martin's wife, escaped from the burning building, and was captured and held prisoner in Tioga County, Pennsylvania for six months until her death.[4]: 242 [8]: 368 \n\nAftermath[edit]\nGnadenhütten Massacre Memorial in Lehighton Pennsylvania.[17]: 30 \n\nColonel John Anderson arrived from New Jersey that night with a company of militia, but after being informed that over 500 Indians had swarmed the settlement,[16] he waited until the following day to approach Gnadenhütten.[14] A number of the Native American converts fled to Wyoming, while others were sent to Bethlehem to live with Moravians there.[13]: 312  Throughout the French and Indian War they experienced significant poverty, and discrimination by the people of Bethlehem.[5]: 135 \n\nGovernor Robert Hunter Morris ordered a company of soldiers from Northampton County, under the command of Captain Hays, to guard the abandoned property at Gnadenhütten until it was safe for the residents to return. They built a small stockade for security, but on 1 January 1756, a number of these troops were lured into a trap, ambushed and killed.[5]: 131  The remaining 18 soldiers fled and the stockade was burned. This led to generalized panic among settlers in the area, and Benjamin Franklin was commissioned in Philadelphia to investigate the situation and devise a plan for the defense of Pennsylvania against further attacks.[14]\n\nOn 14 April 1756, Pennsylvania Governor Morris officially declared war on the Delaware Nation,[18]: 231  offering a bounty of $130 for the scalp of every Lenape male over ten years of age and $50 for a Lenape woman's scalp, or $150 for a male Lenape prisoner and $130 for a female one,[19]: 71–72 [20]: 93  although an exception was made for the Native American converts.[5]: 135 \n\nVictims of the attack are buried in the Lehighton Cemetery.[21]\n\nFort Allen[edit]\nMap showing the location of Fort Allen, upper right quadrant, to the east of Gnadenhütten.\n\nIn late 1755, Colonel John Armstrong wrote to Governor Robert Hunter Morris: \"I am of the opinion that no other means of defense than a chain of blockhouses along or near the south side of the Kittatinny Mountains from the Susquehanna to the temporary line, can secure the lives and property of the inhabitants of this country.\"[14]: 557  Benjamin Franklin visited Gnadenhütten in January 1756 to supervise the construction of Fort Allen.[14] In his biography, he wrote that the Moravians had returned to Gnadenhütten and had made preparations to defend it against further attacks:\n\n\"I was surprised to find it in so good a posture of defence; the destruction of Gnadenhütten had made them apprehend danger. The principal buildings were defended by a stockade; they had purchased a quantity of arms and ammunition from New York and had even placed quantities of small paving stones between the windows of their high stone houses for their women to throw them down upon the heads of any Indians that should attempt to force their way into them. The armed brethren too kept watch, and relieved each other on guard methodically as in any garrison town.\"[22]: 176 \n\nFranklin and his men then built Fort Allen in less than a week. It was essentially a stockade surrounding a well, a barracks, a storeroom, and a gunpowder magazine. It was named for Judge William Allen, father of James Allen who laid out Allentown in 1762.[23]: 15–16  Franklin also supervised the construction of Fort Franklin and Fort Lebanon before commissioning William Clapham to build several other forts which proved essential to the defense of Pennsylvania during the French and Indian War.[14]\n\nMemorialization[edit]\n\nA memorial stone, listing the names of the missionaries who died in the massacre, was placed at the site on 10 December, 1788.[8]: 350  A historical marker was erected in 2005 by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, in downtown Lehighton, Pennsylvania.[21]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d e Paul Peucker, Lanie Graf and Markus Gill, \"The Attack on Gnadenhütten, Nov. 24 1755,\" This Month in Moravian History, , Bethlehem, PA, Nov 2005\n^ \"Lehighton\", Encyclopædia Britannica\n^ Clarence Marsh Case: The Social Psychology of Passive Resistance, PhD Dissertation, Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin, 1915, p. 120\n^ \nJump up to:\na b Sipe, Chester Hale.

A force of 1,500 militias led by Colonel Francisco Javier de Eíío was repelled by 1,000 British infantry and cavalry troops holding the fortress of Colonia del Sacramento and commanded by Colonel Dennis Pack.\n\nBackground[edit]\n\nAfter the conquest of Montevideo by the British expedition under the command of Lieutenant General John Whitelock on 3 February 1807, Rear-Admiral Charles Stirling dispatched the sloop HMS Pheasant to support the capture of the Spanish stronghold of Colonia del Sacramento, that was carried out on 16 March by infantrymen of the 2nd Battalion 95th Rifles without resistance.[1][2] The commander of the fortress, Colonel Ramón del Pino, had evacuated his troops and artillery just a few hours before.[3]\n\nThe commander of the Rifles, Colonel Dennis Pack, deployed groups of 200 or 300 men on several key points around the fortress and mounted chevauls de frise to improve the stronghold defenses. del Pino had meanwhile established his camp on the shores of Colla creek and sent local mounted guerrilas to harass comunications between Colonia and Montevideo.[3]\n\nExpedition from Buenos Aires[edit]\n\nColonel Francisco Javier de Elío, the military commander of the Banda Oriental, managed to flee Montevideo and reached Buenos Aires, where he summoned the main Spanish officers to a war council which decided to gather 500 volunteers, most of them from the Patricios Regiment.[4] de Elìo also received four cannons and two howitzers[5] and funds up to $ 12000.[3]\n\nThe expedition was eventually composed of 900 men under the supreme command of de Elío. The naval forces and the transport fleet would be led by Captain Juan Gutiérrez de la Concha and the artillery corps[6] by Colonel Felipe Sentenach.[7] Besides the Patricios, several militias joined de Elìo's, army, among them the Batallion of Pardos y Morenos, the Batallion of Arribeños and the tercio of Miñones of Catalonya.[8] The fleet departed from Buenos Aires on 13 April, reaching Nueva Palmira (then Las Higueritas) on 16 April. The next day the expedition marched on foot to Calera de las Huèrfanas, where they mounted a camp.[3] The army was reinforced by Spanish stragglers from Montevideo.[4]\n\nThe battle[edit]\n\nOn 21 April, when the expedition reached Real San Carlos, de Elío learned that the British army had made a thrust to the northwest in the believe that incoming Spanish forces were approaching from that direction. de Elío, confident that the British garrison would be exhausted after a full day of march, ordered his troops to move to Colonia through the countryside at night, crossing ravines and reedbeds. The artillery train was left in Real San Carlos.[3] The advance was, in the opinion of a good number of historians, unprofessional at best. No forward parties were sent to sweep the terrain, no previous reconnaissance was performed before the assault. To make things worse, a member of the Catalonian regiment accidentally discharged his rifle, putting the British on alert.[6] Notwithstanding this incident, the Spanish infantry was able to overwhelm a British post, but no further progress was possible because the assaulting troops scattered into the settlement instead of concentrate their efforts on the enemy's positions.[5] This manoeuver allowed a British company to attack the flanks and rout the main Spanish force.[3] de Elìo withdrew to Real San Carlos to protect his artillery and ordered a general retreat to Calera de las Huèrfanas, 70 kilometres (43 mi) away.[3] The Spanish expedition lost eight men and suffered 16 wounded, while one soldier from the British garrison was killed and two officers and a private injured.[4]\n\nAftermath[edit]\n\nde Elìo was heavily criticized by his conduct of the action against Colonia. He was accused of mounting a reckless and harebrained assault without previous knowledge of the terrain, giving the enemy more than enough time to react.[5] de Elío established his headquarters at San Pedro, where the expeditionary army was once again attacked by the British and forced to retreat to Buenos Aires, where they prepared a last ditch defense of the city.[2]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ Marshall, John (1829).

He was one of the founders of a short-lived crafts furniture firm, but is better known for his publications and his editorship of The Architectural Review.[1] Elected to a number of architectural societies, Macartney held the position of Surveyor of the Fabric of St Paul's Cathedral from 1906 to 1931. He was knighted in 1930 for his services to architecture.[2]\n\nEarly life[edit]\n\nBorn in London on 16 September 1853, Macartney spent his youth in County Armagh.[2] Following his studies at Lincoln College, Oxford (1873–1877), he began his career as an architect with Richard Norman Shaw. After travels on the continent in Europe (he travelled in France, Italy and Germany), he began his own practice in around 1880 (sources vary on the exact date).[2]\n\nArchitectural practice[edit]\n\nExamples of buildings and estates that Macartney worked on are Swaylands in the Kentish Weald, a rebuilding of St Leonard's Church, Downham in Lancashire, 169 Queen's Gate in South Kensington, London, St Leonard's, Shoreditch, in London, St James Garlickhythe in the City of London, and St John the Baptist, Egglescliffe in County Durham. As well as his architectural commissions, Macartney served as editor of The Architectural Review from 1905 to 1920.[1][2]\n\nArts and crafts[edit]\n\nAlong with his half-brother, British artist Carlile Henry Hayes Macartney, he was one of the founders of the Art Workers' Guild in 1884. Six years later in 1890, he was one of the co-founders of the furniture company Kenton & Co., based in Kenton Street, Bloomsbury, London. His co-founders were William Lethaby, Ernest Gimson, Reginald Blomfield and Sidney Barnsley. However, the business was disbanded two years later in 1892.[2]\n\nHonours and later life[edit]\n\nPositions and societies Macartney was elected to included: Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (FRIBA), and Honorary Corresponding Member of the American Institute of Architects (AIA). Macartney died on 28 October 1932.[1][2]\n\nPublications[edit]\nLater Renaissance Architecture in England (1901)\nEnglish Houses and Gardens in the 17th and 18th Centuries (1908)\nThe Practical Exemplar of Architecture (1908-27)\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c \"Sir Mervyn Edmund Macartney (1853—1932)\".

Located in the neighbourhood of Barrios Altos, next to Chinatown, it is part of the historic centre of the city.\n\nThe building is made up of a basement that occupies the entire block, with a commercial perimeter ring. The basement is divided into two sectors differentiated by half a level and connected by ramps. A building rests on it. It has two truck entrance ramps to the basement.[1]\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nIn 1846, during the government of President Ramón Castilla, a supreme decree was issued for the construction of a food market in the city of Lima. It was decided that its location would be the same as it currently occupies: the block surrounded by Huallaga, Andahuaylas, Ucayali and Ayacucho streets. The land was expropriated from the nuns of the nearby Convent of La Concepción. In 1852 the construction of what was called the Market of la Concepción (Spanish: Mercado de la Concepción) began, which remained standing until 1905 when it was rebuilt during the administration of the then mayor Federico Elguera. This building was destroyed by a fire on February 28, 1964 after a kitchen explosion.[2][3][4]\n\nAfter the tragedy, which generated the total destruction of the market, the government of Fernando Belaúnde Terry authorized a loan to the Municipality of Lima for the immediate construction of a new market. Architect Alfredo Dammert y Garrico Lecca were hired to lead the project. This decision was the opportunity for the construction in Lima of a market system that would serve the already enormous city of Lima. The reconstruction of the central market was accompanied by the construction of a wholesale and producers' market on the outskirts of the city (limit of the current districts of La Victoria and El Agustino) as well as 26 peripheral retail markets.[1][5]\n\nThe new building was inaugurated on July 8, 1967 at a cost of S/. 90 million at the time and with an area of 12 thousand m2 and the capacity to house 950 sales positions. Additionally, it had 14 cold storage rooms, an unloading basement for 50 trucks and ramps for loading and unloading merchandise. During the 1980s, due to the conditions of political and economic crisis in the country, the market and its surrounding area were immersed in problems of disorder, overcrowding and insecurity. A situation that was corrected towards the end of the 1990s during the mayoralty of Alberto Andrade.[1]\n\nSee also[edit]\nChinatown, Lima\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c Tolentino Cosio, Fiorella Paola (2019-05-10).

It is the largest community bank in Florida and the 7th largest bank based in Florida by total assets. [2] It was formerly known as Mercantil Bank and was officially rebranded as Amerant in October 2018.\n\nHistory[edit]\nEarly years[edit]\n\nAmerant Bank was founded in 1979 as Commercebank N.A. In 1987, the bank was acquired by Mercantil Servicios Financieros (MSF) - ranked as one of the world's biggest 2,000 public companies according to Forbes magazine (2015) at 648th place [3] - and operated as Commercebank until it became known as Mercantil Commercebank in 2007. In September 1979, it was chartered as a national banking association.[4]To reflect its positioning within the U.S. market, the company announced it was rebranding as Amerant in October 2018, just before launching its IPO. The company officially changed its corporate name to Amerant at its annual shareholder's meeting in 2019.\n\nGrowth[edit]\n\nThroughout the years, Amerant Bank has grown organically.[5] In June 2022, Amerant established a new commercial bank presence in the Greater Tampa Bay, Florida market with the opening of a commercial banking office with the goal of providing transactional and business-related services. Mid-2023 the company moved from NASDAQ and its stock began trading on the NYSE.[6]\n\nThe bank has partnered with several US-based professional sports teams since 2022, including the NBA's Miami Heat and the NHL's Florida Panthers as well as colleges including the University of Miami and Rice University in Houston, Texas. [7] The bank has also partnered with local colleges on training financial literacy and skills.[8]\n\nOn September 19, 2023, it was announced that Amerant Bank, would be the new rights partner for the formerly known FLA Live Arena, renaming the arena to Amerant Bank Arena.[9][10]\n\nIndustry changes[edit]\n\nWhen the financial crisis of 2007–2008 occurred, the bank chose not to accept government assistance through the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The bank also largely was unaffected during 2023 United States banking crisis as its deposits were heavily diversified and the majority was insured through the United States' FDIC program.\n\nNaming rights and sponsorships[edit]\n\nAmerant Bank owns corporate naming rights to the following:\n\nAmerant Bank Arena, an Arena in Sunrise, Florida, home of the Florida Panthers, an NHL National Hockey League hockey team.\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"Amerant Bancorp Inc. 2022 Form 10-K Annual Report\".

The couple were seen embracing at Copenhagen Airport in September 1966. Their engagement was announced on 4 October 1966.[1]\n\nThat same day, the Folketing granted their consent to the union.[2] On the morning of 5 October, the King asked the Council of State for their formal consent to the marriage, which was granted. The couple and their families appeared on the balcony of the Amalienborg and drove in open cars through the streets of Copenhagen to a luncheon at Fredensborg Palace.[3]\n\nHenri presented Princess Margrethe with a toi et moi style diamond engagement ring made by Van Cleef & Arpels. The ring features two square-cut diamonds mounted diagonally on a yellow gold band.[2]\n\nThe wedding was set for 25 May 1967, the day after Margrethe's parent's 32nd wedding anniversary, but was pushed back to June as her sister, Queen Anne-Marie of the Hellenes, was expecting. Her son, Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece, was born on 20 May 1967.[3][1]\n\nPre-wedding celebrations[edit]\nMargrethe and Henri at the French Embasassy in Copenhagen, 7 June 1967\n\nHenri moved full-time to Copenhagen at the end of May 1967, he also converted from the Roman Catholicim to Lutheranism and changed the spelling of his name from the French Henri to the Danish Henrik.[1]\n\nSeveral pre-wedding dinners, balls and galas were held in the couple's honour. This began when the King and Queen hosted a gala for the diplomatic corp Christiansborg Palace on 30 May, followed by a special performance by the Royal Danish Ballet at the Royal Danish Theatre on 31 May, a gala for the Danish government at Christiansborg Palace on 2 June, a dinner at Fredensborg Palace to celebrate the engagement of Margrethe's sister, Princess Benedikte, to Prince Richard of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg on 5 June, and a ball at the French Embassy on 7 June.[3]\n\nWedding[edit]\n\nPrincess Margrethe and Henri de Laborde de Monpezat were married on Saturday, 10 June 1967, at 17:00 local time at the Holmen Church. The Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Denmark ceremony was performed by Erik Jensen, Bishop of Aalborg and Chaplin of the Royal Court. The ceremony lasted just 20 minutes.[1][4]\n\nMusic[edit]\n\nPrincess Margrethe and her father walked down the aisle to a sixteenth-century music setting of Psalm 42. Two hymns were sung during the service. The couple left the church to Charles-Marie Widor's \"Toccata\" from Symphonie pour orgue No. 5.[3]\n\nAttire[edit]\n\nPrincess Margrethe wore a silk wedding gown with a six-meter train by Danish fashion designer Jørgen Bender. She wore the Irish lace veil her maternal grandmother, Princess Margaret of Connaught, wore at her wedding in 1905. She also wore the diamond tiara by Cartier her grandmother had received as a wedding gift from the Khedive of Egypt and a diamond daisy brooch belonging to her mother made with diamonds that had belonged to Margaret of Connaught.[5]\n\nHenri wore evening dress with the riband and star of the Order of the Elephant, which King Frederik IX had bestowed upon him that day.[3]\n\nAttendants[edit]\n\nPrincess Margrethe had four teenage bridesmaids: Kristin Dahl, Countess Désirée of Rosenborg (daughter of Count Flemming of Rosenborg), Anne and Carina Oxholm Tillisch. Henri's best man was his brother Etienne de Laborde de Monpezat.[3]\n\nReception[edit]\n\nThe wedding reception for 400 guests was held at Fredensborg Palace.[4] The now Prince Henrik gave a speech where he stated his new wife was the \"single most beautiful adornment\" in the \"blooming garden\" that is Denmark. This was referenced during his funeral when he requested floral arrangements in the Christiansborg Palace Chapel be arranged like a blooming garden.[6]\n\nGuests[edit]\n\nThe wedding was attended by members of the couple's families, foreign royal families, and Danish and French dignitaries. The bride's sister and brother-in-law, Queen Anne-Marie and King Constantine II of Greece, were notably absent due to political instability in their country following a coup d'état on 21 April 1967.[1] Queen Ingrid placed photos of the Greek royal couple around Fredensborg Palace during the reception to ensure their absence was felt.[7] Notable guests in attendance included:[3][1]\n\nRelatives of the bride[edit]\nDanish royal family[edit]\nThe King and Queen of Denmark, the bride's parents\nPrincess Benedikte of Denmark and the Prince of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg, the bride's sister and her fiancé\nThe Hereditary Prince and Hereditary Princess of Denmark, the bride's paternal aunt and uncle\nPrincess Elisabeth of Denmark, the bride's paternal first cousin\nPrince Ingolf of Denmark, the bride's paternal first cousin\nPrince Christian of Denmark, the bride's paternal first cousin\nPrince Gorm of Denmark, the bride's paternal first cousin once removed\nCount and Countess Oluf of Rosenborg, the bride's paternal first cousin once removed and his wife\nMr and Mrs Christian Castenskjold, the bride's second cousin once removed and his wife\nCount and Countess Valdemar of Rosenborg, the bride's paternal second cousin once removed and his wife\nPrincess Axel of Denmark, the bride's paternal first cousin once removed (and widow of the bride's first cousin twice removed)\nPrince and Princess Georg of Denmark, the bride's paternal second cousin and his wife\nCount and Countess Flemming of Rosenborg, the bride's paternal second cousin and his wife\nCountess Désirée of Rosenborg, the bride's paternal second cousin once removed\nCountess Alexandra, Mrs Ivar Vind, and Mr Ivar Vind, the bride's paternal second cousin once removed and her husband\nCount and Countess Christian of Rosenborg, the bride's paternal second cousin once removed and his wife\nPrince Viggo, Count of Rosenborg, the bride's paternal first cousin twice removed\nPrincess René of Bourbon-Parma, the bride's paternal first cousin twice removed\nSwedish royal family[edit]\nThe King of Sweden, the bride's maternal grandfather\nThe Duchess of Västerbotten, the bride's maternal aunt-by-marriage\nPrincess Margaretha, Mrs John Ambler, and Mr John Ambler, the bride's maternal first cousin and her husband\nPrincess Birgitta and Prince Johann Georg of Hohenzollern, the bride's maternal first cousin and her husband\nPrincess Désirée, Baroness Niclas Silfverschiöld, and Baron Niclas Silfverschiöld, the bride's maternal first cousin and her husband\nPrincess Christina of Sweden, the bride's maternal first cousin\nThe Crown Prince of Sweden, the bride's maternal first cousin\nCount and Countess Sigvard Bernadotte of Wisborg, the bride's maternal uncle and aunt\nThe Duke of Halland, the bride's maternal uncle\nCount and Countess Carl Johan Bernadotte of Wisborg, the bride's maternal uncle and aunt\nRelatives of the groom[edit]\nAndré and Renée de Laborde de Monpezat, the groom's parents\nFrançoise Bardin, the groom's sister\nMaurille Beauvillain, the groom's sister\nÉtienne de Laborde de Monpezat, the groom's brother\nJean-Baptiste de Laborde de Monpezat, the groom's brother\nForeign royal guests[edit]\nMembers of reigning royal houses[edit]\n The King and Queen of the Belgians, the bride's paternal second cousin and his wife\n The Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, the bride's maternal third cousin once removed and paternal second cousin\n The Queen of the Netherlands, the bride's paternal first cousin twice removed\n Princess Beatrix and Prince Claus of the Netherlands, the bride's paternal second cousin once removed and her husband\n The King of Norway, the bride's paternal first cousin once removed\n The Crown Prince of Norway, the bride's paternal second cousin\n Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, the bride's paternal second cousin once removed\n Captain Alexander Ramsay of Mar and the Mistress of Saltoun, the bride's maternal first cousin once removed and his wife\nMembers of non-reigning royal houses[edit]\nThe Prince and Princess of Asturias, the bride's third cousins\nThe Prince and Princess of Prussia, the bride's paternal first cousin once removed and maternal second cousin once removed\nDuke and Duchess Christian of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, the bride's paternal first cousin once removed and maternal third cousin\nPrincess Tatiana Radziwiłł and Dr Jean Henri Fruchaud, the bride's paternal third cousin and her husband\nSee also[edit]\nWedding of Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark, and Mary Donaldson\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d e f LeeMiller, Heaven. \"The wedding of a queen and a prince who longed to be a king\".

After evading capture for 12 years, Kepe was apprehended and executed.[1]\n\nLife[edit]\nEarly Life[edit]\n\nJohn Kepe, (more accurately spelled Khebe) from the Mpinga clan, of the Xhosa nation, was born near Pearston in the Eastern Cape around the year 1898. Kepe was arrested by Sgt. Christiaan Potgieter on separate occasions for theft and housebreaking in 1921, 1927 and 1933. The last of these arrests occurred near Pearston where Kepe had attempted an attack with an axe in an attempt to escape arrest. He was subsequently sentenced to seven years in jail.[2][3]\n\nOutlaw[edit]\n\nIn early 1940 John Keppe was released from jail having completed his sentence and started living in a cave in the Boschberg mountain around Somerset East. Before the year was out, Sgt. Potgieter was transferred to the Somerset East area and started investigating a series of shop burglaries and random incidents of theft both in Somerset East and nearby areas like Cookhouse, Kommadagga, and Longhope. Many of these crimes were never officially linked to John Kepe. While many suspects were apprehended, the petty burlguries and incidences of stock theft (mainly sheep) did not cease.\n\nBy the year 1950, local police were logging approximately one incident a week of stock theft and house burglaries from farmers in the Boschberg area. In the meantime, John Kepe had garnered a reputation among locals.\n\nNow, Kepe was at the height of his criminal prowess and began leaving mocking notes, taking care never to reveal his identity to the police. He would even join search parties and go on the hunt for himself.\n\nKepe had succeeded in keeping the true identity of mysterious Boschberg outlaw a secret, so much so that many locals in the area did not know who Kepe was until he was eventually arrested. While a few residents of Somerset East were aware of Kepe who would descend from the mountain from time to time to socialise at the community drinking hall, residents didn't know that Kepe was the wanted notorious thief and outlaw plaguing the area around the Boschberg.[4][5]\n\nMurder[edit]\n\nIn late November 1951, the home of Dirk Goliath a local farm worker was reportedly burgled and Goliath himself had encountered a man in possession of a .22 rifle claiming to be a police officer hunting the bandit in the Boschberg area.\n\nOn 14 December 1951 Dirk Goliath, failed to return home from work. Goliath's employer, Dix Erasmus informed police and a search for Goliath was launched the same day.\n\nDirk Goliaths body was discovered above Rooikraans the next day. Despite an armed group of approximately 70 men searching every inch of the mountain and its surrounds, John Kepe was nimble enough to steal potatoes and burgle the farmhouse of the farm Ongegund owned by Sgt. J.P. Botha and still evade detection.\n\nBy February 22 1952, despite increased police presence in the Boschberg area, Kepe continued his banditry and no arrests were made for either the stock theft, burglary or murder of Dirk Goliath.[6]\n\nCapture & Execution[edit]\n\nOn the night of 25 February, Sergeants Botha and Potgieter, as well as four constables, headed for the Boschberg again. The police had theorised that the bandit had to have been curing all the mutton he was stealing so despite the rainy weather, Botha and a Constable Mafukuzele laid an ambush near a salt shed on the farm, Grootfontein.\n\nIn a stroke of luck for the police, Kepe stumbled into the ambush party on the very same night and after a brief scuffle, Sgt. Botha drew his firearm and Kepe surrendered.\n\nMoments after his arrest, John Kepe requested to accompany the police officers back to his cave so that he may retrieve his tobacco. Kepe then led the police to the cave where he had lived in for more than a decade.\n\nInside the cave, there was a wealth of stored stolen goods, including cooking utensils, supplies and clothes. Kepe further revealed two other caves he had used which had remained undiscovered prior to his capture. One cave Kepe called his “icebox’’, which was fitted with wire for hanging and curing meat, while the other was used to store more than 100 sheepskins.\n\nUpon returning to the farm Ongegund, Sgt. Potgieter was reunited with Kepe, the man he had arrested several times many years back in Pearston.\n\nKepe's trial began at the magisterial court in Cradock on the 19th of March 1952. He arrived to the courthouse and addressed the throng of onlookers and spectators outside the courthouse by yelling “I am the Samson of the Boschberg! When the Philistines caught Samson, all the other Philistines came out to look at him just as you are doing today!’’ The trial completed on the 22th of April in the same year. John Kepe had confessed in full all of his crimes and was found guilty of burglary, stock theft and the murder of Dirk Goliath. Kepe was permitted to address the court and he said, pointing to the jury “If these people are without sin, then they can hang me.’’\n\nBefore being led away after the proceedings, Sgt. Potgieter and Kepe enjoyed a friendly conversation. Two months later, Kepe requested to see Potgieter again for a final time. This meeting, was the last time Kepe met with anyone outside of prison. Potgieter never discussed the details of his final meeting with Kepe shortly before Kepe’s execution.\n\nJohn Kepe, the self-proclaimed \"Samson of The Boschberg\" was executed by hanging at the Pretoria Gallows on the 25th June 1952.[7][8][9]\n\nLegacy[edit]\nThe story of Kepe's life forms the basis of Jahmil X.T. Qubeka's 2018 film Sew the Winter to My Skin which was selected as the South African entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 91st Academy Awards, but was ultimately not nominated.[10][11]\nReferences[edit]\n^ https://www.farmersweekly.co.za/rural-insight/john-kepe-boschbergs-infamous-stock-thief/\n^ https://www.heraldlive.co.za/news/2019-01-21-tale-of-legendary-outlaw-john-kepe-brought-to-life/\n^ https://www.farmersweekly.co.za/rural-insight/john-kepe-boschbergs-infamous-stock-thief/\n^ https://karoospace.co.za/mountains-of-the-karoo-heartland/\n^ https://www.farmersweekly.co.za/rural-insight/john-kepe-boschbergs-infamous-stock-thief/\n^ https://www.farmersweekly.co.za/rural-insight/john-kepe-boschbergs-infamous-stock-thief/\n^ https://www.farmersweekly.co.za/rural-insight/john-kepe-boschbergs-infamous-stock-thief/\n^ https://karoospace.co.za/mountains-of-the-karoo-heartland/\n^ https://www.heraldlive.co.za/news/2019-01-21-tale-of-legendary-outlaw-john-kepe-brought-to-life/\n^ \"South Africa's official selection to the 91st Annual Academy Awards (Oscars) Best Foreign Language Film\".\n^ \"South Africa Picks Real-Life Robin Hood Tale 'Sew the Winter to My Skin' for Oscars\"."}

It is part of the Pasubio massif in the Vicentine Alps, in the Province of Trento.[1][2][3][4]\n\nOverlooking the Vallarsa and close to the border between Trentino and Veneto, which until 1918 marked the border between the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Kingdom of Italy, Monte Corno was the theatre of heavy fighting in the First World War, especially during the battle of Asiago; it changed hands three times between 1916 and 1918, being finally seized by Italian troops on 13 May 1918. Italian irredentist Cesare Battisti was captured on Monte Corno on 10 July 1916 and executed by the Austro-Hungarians for treason (as he was an Austro-Hungarian citizen); the mountain was renamed Corno Battisti in his honor.[5][6][7][8]\n\nTunnels and other remnants of the war can be seen to this day.

It improves upon and replaces the Type 08 wheeled armored vehicle family.[2]\n\nHistory and development[edit]\n\nIn June 2020, a new type of 8x8 armored was observed in development to replace the Type 08 wheeled armored vehicle.[3] In 2023, the vehicle entered service and was reportedly designated Type 19. Type 19 is the third-generation wheeled armored fighting vehicle of Chinese origin, after WZ-551 and Type 08.[4] Overall, Type 19 is an upgraded iteration of Type 08 armored vehicle.[2]\n\nIn November 2021, the vehicle was observed in deployment with Eastern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army, specifically in the Guangdong region by Taiwan Strait.[1] The vehicle is also expected to be inducted by the People's Liberation Army Navy Marine Corps.[2]\n\nDesign[edit]\n\nThe vehicle layout of the Type 19 is similar to the previous Type 08 vehicles, with the driver and engine bay at the front and the troop compartment in the middle.[2] However, unlike Type 08, Type 19 features an unmanned weapon station as a turret, offering a more spacious interior for the dismounted infantry.[4] The crew consists of three people: the driver, the gunner, and the commander.[2]\n\nThe armament consists of one barrel of 30 mm autocannon, one 5.8 mm coaxial machine gun, and four HJ-16 anti-tank guided missiles.[2][4] The anti-tank guided missiles are mounted in an armored enclosure located on the right-hand side of the turret, with armored plates protecting its side.[2] The HJ-16 missile is developed from an export-oriented QN-502C missile, with fire-and-forget launch mode, TV/thermal dual-mode seeker, inertial guidance, man-in-the-loop target datalink, 10 km (6.2 mi) of range, and armor penetration capability of 1000&nbspmm.[4][5] The missile can attack helicopters and target ground vehicles from top-attack angles.[4]\n\nThe turret features exposed connector panels for installing observation equipment, sensors, and possibly an active protection system.[2] The electric-optical sensor, meteorological sensor, communication suite, Beidou satellite positioning system antenna, laser warning system receivers, identification friend or foe (IFF) system is mounted on the turret top.[5] The vehicle body is fitted with multiple distributed aperture systems to detect threats from all angles.[5]\n\nAccording to Janes Information Services, the vehicle is expected to be heavier than its predecessor due to having better armor protection.[1] Armor plates are bolted on the turret and vehicle body to improve ballistic protection,[6] with provisions for reactive armour (ERA) blocks.[2] The air conditioning system and engine exhaust are concealed for thermal signature reduction.[6]\n\nThe mobility of Type 19 is reportedly similar to its predecessor, powered by Deutz BF6M1015C, developing 440hp.[2] The suspension system is reportedly redesigned to support extra weight and improve driving performance.[1]\n\nVariants[edit]\n\nThe Type 19 vehicle features two variants. The assault gun variant features 105&nbspmm tank gun. The armored personnel carrier (APC) variant features an enlarged troop compartment.[6]\n\nOperators[edit]\n People's Republic of China\nPeople's Liberation Army Ground Force\nSee also[edit]\nType 08\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d Kajal, Kapil; Butterworth, Sonny (7 November 2023). \"China deploys new infantry fighting vehicles along Taiwan Strait\".

It is surrounded by the Healesville Freeway Reserve to the north, the Morack Public Golf Course (and adjacent reserve to the east), Verona Street to the south and housing on Morack Road to the west.\n\nHistory[edit]\nWinswood Close Estate in Vermont South, Victoria, Australia.\n\nThe Winswood Close Estate has its origins in the colonial land sales in what is known the Vermont area that commenced in 1875. Two large parcels of land on what was then L.L. Vale Road (now Boronia Road) were sold to John Keenan and Issac Moore. Keenan's land was to the west of Moore's. Both landowners used their land to develop apple orchards.\n\nJohn Keenan subdivided his land in 1900 and a portion covering what is now the western half of Winswood Close Estate was sold to Charles Pruett Stagg.In 1943, this land was sold to Lennox Arthur Petty Webb before being aquired in 1956 by Margaret Mary Livermore.\n\nThe Moore family named their property \"Winswood\". They expanded their holdings of land on what is now the eastern half of the Winswood Close Estate over subsequent decades. This land transferred to Frederick Shipley Moore in 1899 [1] before being subdivided further and transferred to the following people:\n\nRoy Gordon Livermore (1914) [2]\nStanly Douglas Livermore (1919) [3]\nClement Rose Livermore (1923)\nJane Roberts Livermore (1932) [4]\nEva Katherine Livermore (1940)\nJane Roberts Livermore (1954) [5]\nMargaret Mary Livermore (1956) [6]\n\nIn 1975, the Livermore family sold Winswood to Lend Lease Homes Pty. Ltd. and the area ceased to be an orchard.\n\nLand Sales[edit]\nA 1978 advertisement for houses in the Vermont South area.\n\nIn 1976, Lend Lease Homes subdivided their holding into 40 lots and created the streets Winswood Close and Livermore Close which branched of pre-existing Verona Street. [7]. House and land packages were subsequently sold to members of the public.[8]. Two of the house designs offered for sale by Lend Lease included the \"Courtline\" and the \"Mosshaven\". The houses were initially regarded as being \"pricey\" and many were discounted after sales were initially slow.[9]\n\nEtymology[edit]\n\nThe Winswood Close Estate and Winswood Close are named after the farm property \"Winswood\". Livermore Close is named after the Livermore family who previously owned the land.\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ Land Titles Office, Victoria.

One of the toilets was also removed in order to provide more seating, and the light sources were changed to produce more illumination. In the driving cabs, the colour scheme was also changed, and the seat for the co-driver was removed and a more ergonomic seat for the driver was added.[3]\n\nAll the units in this series after being remodelled were integrated into the CP Class 0450 series, becoming extinct in 2001.[1]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b \"CP withdrawn trainsets and motor cars\".

In 2021, a Tom Brady rookie card produced by Pacific sold for $117,000 eBay.[1]\n\nCompany History[edit]\nEarly years[edit]\n\nMike Cramer, the founder of Pacific Trading Cards, began collecting baseball cards at nine years old.[1] His first card was a Babe Ruth card from a nickel pack of Fleer 1960 All-Time Greats cards.[1] He began selling soda bottles and mowing lawns so that he could buy more cards, collecting over 11,000 cards by the time he was eleven years old.[1] By the time he was fifteen, Cramer had collected more than 500,000 cards.[1] He ran ads, buying and selling cards from his family home in Arizona.[1] Beginning in 1969, Cramer spent ten seasons Alaskan king crab fishing, earning and saving money which he later used to purchase his first home and found Pacific Trading Cards.[1] He married his wife, Cheryl, in 1973 in Dutch Harbor, Alaska, and she began helping him with his trading cards business, even helping him move boxes trading cards onto his boat on their wedding night.[1][2][3] In 1977, Cramer entered into a deal with Topps and purchased all of their closeout cases of cards.[1] Cramer stored truckloads of trading cards in a storage unit.[1] Cramer began running a mail-order catalog from his home in Edmonds, Washington, and began buying and selling cards full-time.[1]\n\n1980-2004[edit]\n\nIn 1980, Cramer opened a trading cards store in the Perrinville neighborhood of Edmonds.[1] There was a warehouse factory across the street that began producing trading cards for the Triple-A Pacific Coast League.[1][2] Pacific was the first company to begin making plastic sheets to put trading cards in binders.[2] As the company began making cards, Cramer shot many of the card photos himself.[3]\n\nIn 1989, Cramer built a manufacturing plant in Lynnwood, Washington, which produced the company's cards.[1] At its height, the factory employed 230 people.[1] The company released a Ken Griffey Jr. chocolate bar in 1989 after converting one of their card-wrapping machines to wrap chocolate bars, selling almost one million bars.[1][3]\n\nIn 1991, Pacific released a set of 110 Desert Storm trading cards featuring leaders, weapons, and soldiers involved in Operation Desert Shield.[4] That same year Pacific also released a set of I Love Lucy trading cards.[2] In 1993, Pacific finally received its first Major League Baseball license and began producing MLB cards in the Spanish language.[2]\n\nIn 1999, Pacific released the first-ever Kurt Warner and Tom Brady rookie cards.[5][3] While Cramer was in Northern California for the annual East-West Shrine Bowl, he shot dozens of photos of Brady, who was a quarterback at Michigan at the time.[3] Brady was not invited to the 2000 NFLPA Rookie Photo Shoot because he was a sixth-round pick, but Cramer used the photos he had shot and put Brady in Pacific's 2000 NFL sets. Pacific released its first set in May 2000, making Pacific's #403 Brady card the first NFL trading card ever produced of Brady.[3] The company also signed Brady to an autograph deal, getting a total of 700 cards signed.[3] In 2021, one of Tom Brady's Pacific rookie cards sold for $117,000.[1]\n\nIn 2000, Pacific Trading Cards released a Manny Ramirez baseball card featuring a corked bat, causing controversy.[1] Many people thought that releasing a card featuring a corked bat was a publicity stunt, but employees from Pacific claim that is not the case.[2] Cramer claims the bats were sourced from the teams and then sent away to be cut up.[2] The pieces of the bats were then sent to Great Western Press, where the baseball cards were printed.[2] The cards were finally sent back to Lynnwood and were packaged at Pacific's headquarters.[2] They later found out that a card with a piece of cork was sent to a dealer and Pacific immediately stopped production and went through the cards, finding a few more which were not released.[2]\n\nIn 2003, Pacific lost its NFL license.[5] The National Football League Players Association pulled Pacific's license after sports card shop owners complained that there were too many card brands and products.[5] By 2004, the only major license Pacific held was for the National Hockey League.[2] When the 2004–05 NHL lockout started, Cramer decided to retire and sold Pacific Trading Cards to Playoff.[1][5] Playoff was later sold to Panini Group, which continued Pacific's Prism line under the slightly altered name \"Prizm\".[5]\n\nMemoir[edit]\n\nIn October 2023, Cramer's book, Cramer's Choice: Memoir of a Baseball Card Collector Turned Manufacturer was published by McFarland & Company.[1] Cramer began writing the book a few years prior, after he was diagnosed with a rare form of lymphoma, intending to document his life for his children and grandchildren.[1][2] Bob Uecker had originally given Cramer the idea for the book.[2] He wrote 117,000 words on an iPad, letter by letter, and later sent it to McFarland, which immediately accepted the manuscript.[1] The final product is about 90,000 words.[1]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z Brown, Andrea (October 10, 2023). \"It's in the cards: Edmonds trading card magnate Mike Cramer tells all\".

This album is the third re-recorded album by Noah and was released on January 12, 2022 through Musica Studio's. This album is the third release from the \"Second Chance\" quadrilogy project, where Noah re-recorded all their songs when they were still called Peterpan.\n\nThis album consists of 8 songs from the Peterpan version of the album Bintang Di Surga. Two songs from the Peterpan album, \"Aku\" and \"Pasa Lalu Terbesar\", were not included in the new album version. Noah fans speculate that this happened because the songs were written by Peterpan personnel who had previously left in 2006, namely Andika (keyboard) and Indra (bass guitar).[1] Meanwhile, Andika said that he had no problem if the song was included and that it was all Noah's decision.[2]\n\nRelease and promotion[edit]\n\nWhen Noah published the album Second Chance, RM. Adji Srihandoyodari from Trans Retail said that Second Chance is the first of four albums and will be followed by Noah's version of Taman Langit, Bintang di Surga, and Hari yang Cerah.[3] Musica Studio's director, Indrawati Widjaja, said that the publication would be gradual throughout 2015.[4] However, on December 3, 2015, Ariel said that the three albums, including Noah's version of \"Bintang Di Surga\", had not been completed.[5] On December 12, 2021, when announcing that the Noah's version of Taman Langit would be released, Noah said that Peterpan's other albums, including Bintang di Surga, would be released in 2022.[6]\n\nBefore releasing the album, Noah released the song \"Bintang di Surga\" as a single and released the video clip on January 7, 2022.[7][8] Noah's version of the album Bintang di Surga was then released on digital music platforms on January 12, 2022.[1]\n\nTo support the album launch, Noah held a concert entitled Bintang di Surga on January 29, 2022 at the Tentrem Hotel, Yogyakarta.[9] Tickets sold for the concert sold out within an hour. Eight of the fifteen songs that Noah performed at the concert came from this album.[10]\n\nTrack listing[edit]\n\nAll songs written by Ariel.\n\nNo.\tTitle\tLength\n1.\t\"Ada Apa Denganmu\"\t4:43\n2.\t\"Mungkin Nanti\"\t4:29\n3.\t\"Khayalan Tingkat Tinggi\"\t3:24\n4.\t\"Di Belakangku\"\t5:02\n5.\t\"Ku Katakan Dengan Indah\"\t6:11\n6.\t\"Tetap Berdiri (2DSD)\"\t3:47\n7.\t\"Diatas Normal\"\t3:38\n8.\t\"Bintang di Surga\"\t5:01\n\nTotal length:\n\t36:15\nPersonnel[edit]\n\nCredits of additional musicians and production personnel adapted from the album's liner notes.[11]\n\nNOAH\n\nAriel – vocal\nLukman – lead guitar\nUki – guitar, audio engineer\nDavid – keyboards, piano, synthesizer\nReza – drum percussion\n\nAdditional Musicians\n\nBoyi Tondo - bass guitar\nLanlan – bass guitar\nIwan Sukma - guitar audio engineer\nRio Alief – drums, beat loops and synthesizer\nHenry Lamiri – string\nDimas Mufli Utomo – loop beats and synthesizer\nRicky Johanes – loop beats and synthesizer\nMaizura – backing vocals on track 5\n\nProduction\n\nMoko Aguswan – audio mixing\nArief Renaldi – audio mixing\nSadat Effendy – audio mixing\nJosep Manurung – audio engineer\nHoras Pinem – audio engineer\nToni Hawaii – audio mastering\nGita Roni – Protools editor\nCrimson Merry – Protools editor\nTeddy Riadi – sound supervisor\n\nArtwork\n\nEdelweiss line – cover design\nAditya Dwi Prasetya – creative and design supervisor\nSehan Idruz – design and pre-production\nReferences[edit]\n^ a b Yoga Aditya Pratama (12 January 2022).

During this time, the Elector of Braunschweig-Lüneburg or King of Hanover was also King of Great Britain. With the Act of Settlement in 1701, the English Parliament created the basis for the Protestant succession of the House of Hanover to the throne in the Kingdom of England, later the Kingdom of Great Britain. Different succession rules led to the dissolution of the personal union.\n\nAfter the death of Queen Anne Stuart of Great Britain, who had no descendants, the Elector of Braunschweig-Lüneburg, Georg Ludwig, inherited the British royal crown in 1714 as the closest Protestant relative in accordance with the Act of Settlement of 1701. Through this personal union, Georg Ludwig connected Great Britain with the German Electorate, which thus became one of the most powerful in the Holy Roman Empire. However, Hanover was to retain its independence, which is why the state treasury and government affairs remained separate. Electoral Hanover was administered and governed by the German Chancery in London and the Hanover minister there as well as the Privy Council in Hanover, who consulted with the ruler and carried out his instructions. Only Georg Ludwig and his son Georg August still traveled to the Electorate. The personal union only ended in 1837 with the accession of Queen Victoria to the throne, since in the Kingdom of Hanover, the successor state to the Electorate of Braunschweig-Lüneburg, only male descendants could inherit the throne according to the Salian law of succession. Therefore, control in Hanover passed to Victoria's uncle, Ernst August, Duke of Cumberland.[1]\n\nMonarchs[edit]\n\nThe succession to the throne of the personal union:\n\nGeorge I (from August 1, 1714)\nGeorge II (from October 11th, 1727)\nGeorge III (from October 25, 1760)\nGeorge IV (from January 29, 1820)\nWilliam IV (from June 26, 1830 to June 20, 1837)\nSee also[edit]\nHouse of Hanover\nReferences[edit]\n^ Drögereit, Richard (1949).

This is the second in a series of entire projects to re-record songs that Noah recorded when it was still under the Peterpan name. This album contains songs from Peterpan's album, Taman Langit, which was released in 2003. This album was released on December 17, 2021 via Musica Studio's on digital music portals and in CD format. To support the launch of the album, Noah made a music video for the album version of the song \"Yang Terdalam\" with the same concept, but different actors, to the video that Peterpan previously made for the song.\n\nThe song Yang Terdalam was used as the soundtrack for the soap opera Roda-Roda Gila which will air on SCTV in 2022. [1] The song Topeng which is used as the soundtrack for the soap opera Avisa Putri Samudera which was aired on MNCTV in 2022. The song Sahabat which used as the soundtrack for the soap opera Takut Ga Sih... which was aired on RCTI in 2022. The song Semua Tentang Kita which used as the soundtrack for the soap opera Cinta Tanpa Karena which was aired on RCTI in 2023.\n\nBackground[edit]\nSee also: Second Chance\n\nTaman Langit is Peterpan's first studio album which was released in 2003.[2] In 2012, Peterpan changed its name to Noah.[3] Because they had changed their name, Noah wanted to re-record the songs their songs from the Peterpan era. The reasons include that Noah wants the masters of their old songs to be under Noah's name and wants to make their initial wishes come true when recording which can only be realized now that Noah has enough experience in terms of recording music.[4]\n\nRecording[edit]\n\nOn March 3, 2015, Noah's vocalist, Ariel announced on her social media that they were working on Noah's version of Taman Langit album and shared a snippet of the song \"Semua Tentang Kita\" which is being re-arranged.[5]\n\nMusic[edit]\n\nAriel said that although all the songs were re-recorded, not all of them were re-arranged in the new version of Taman Langit. The reason is because there are several songs whose melodies are already attached, such as the guitar melody of the song \"Semua Tentang Kita\".[2] Ariel's voice, which is now heavier, is also a consideration in determining whether the song's vocals need to be rearranged or not.[6] According to Ariel, the sound of the recording of the album Taman Langit is very different from the 2003 version.[2]\n\nRelease and promotion[edit]\n\nWhen Noah published the album Second Chance, RM. Adji Srihandoyodari from Trans Retail said that Second Chance is the first of four albums and will be followed by Noah's versions of Taman Langit, Bintang di Surga, and Hari yang Cerah[7] Musica Studio's director, Indrawati Widjaja, said that the publication would be gradual throughout 2015.[8] However, on December 3, 2015, Ariel said that the three albums, including Noah's version of Taman Langit, had not been completed.[9]\n\nOn December 12, 2021, Noah announced that he would release a re-recorded version of Taman Langit.[2] On the same day, Noah performed an exclusive concert at Hutan Kota by Plataran, Central Jakarta for promote the album.[10]\n\nNoah's version of Taman Langit was released on December 17, 2021 on digital music services and in CD format.[11] To support it, Noah released a music video for their version of the song \"Yang Terdalam\" on the same day. In the new music video, Iqbaal Ramadhan walks past several traders on the side of the road like Ariel did in the Peterpan version of the video.[12]\n\nAccolades[edit]\n\nAt Anugerah Musik Indonesia 2022, Taman Langit received nominations for the awards Best-Best Album and Best Pop Album.[13]\n\nTrack listing[edit]\n\nAll songs written by Ariel, except \"Sahabat\" by Ariel, Uki, and Lukman with lyrics from Ariel and \"Kita Tawa\" by Lukman with lyrics from Ariel.\n\nNo.\tTitle\tLength\n1.\t\"Sahabat\"\t4:34\n2.\t\"Aku & Bintang\"\t3:49\n3.\t\"Semua Tentang Kita\"\t4:29\n4.\t\"Dan Hilang\"\t3:59\n5.\t\"Satu Hati\"\t3:49\n6.\t\"Mimpi yang Sempurna\"\t3:37\n7.\t\"Taman Langit\"\t3:29\n8.\t\"Yang Terdalam\"\t3:19\n9.\t\"Tertinggalkan Waktu\"\t4:05\n10.\t\"Kita Tertawa\"\t3:22\n11.\t\"Topeng\"\t4:23\n\nTotal length:\n\t43:55\nPersonnel[edit]\n\nCredits of additional musicians and production personnel adapted from the album's liner notes.[14]\n\nNOAH\n\nAriel – vocal\nDavid – keyboards, piano, synthesizer\nLukman – lead guitar\nReza – drum percussion\nUki – guitar, audio engineer\n\nAdditional Musicians\n\nBoyi Tondo - bass guitar\nLanlan – bass guitar\nRio Alief - percussion drum\nHenry Lamiri – string instruments\nSophia Latjuba – backing vocals on songs 6 & 8\n\nProduction\n\nMoko Aguswan – audio mixing\nArief Renaldi – audio mixing\nSadat Effendy – audio mixing\nJosep Manurung – audio engineer\nHoras Pinem – audio engineer\nToni Hawaii – audio mastering\nGita Roni – Protools editor\nCrimson Merry – Protools editor\nTeddy Riadi – sound supervisor\n\nArtwork\n\nGaris Edelweiss – cover designer\nAditya Dwi Prasetya – creative and design supervisor\nSehan Idruz – design and pre-production\nReferensi[edit]\n^ Video Lirik Yang Terdalam (Noah) | Ost.

(December 2023)\nCoat of Arms of Wettin kings of Poland\nThe Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1701\n\nThe personal union of Poland and Saxony, or Saxony-Poland, was the personal union that existed from 1697 to 1706 and from 1709 to 1763 between the Electorate of Saxony under the House of Wettin and the aristocratic republic/elective monarchy of Poland-Lithuania. After the death of Augustus III of Poland in 1763, the personal union expired because the guardian of the still underage Saxon Elector Friedrich August III. (1750–1827) renounced his claims to the throne and the Russian Empress Catherine the Great had her favorite Stanislaus II August Poniatowski elected king. In Poland, the period with Wettin rulers on the Polish throne is also called the Saxon period (czasy saskie). In Polish memory it is known for its particular disorder.\n\nThis period was the first since Bolesław the Brave that Poland and Meissen/Saxony were politically connected.\n\nDominions[edit]\nElectorate of Saxony in the Holy Roman Empire (1648)\nPoland-Lithuania[edit]\n\nDue to the exhausting Second Northern War, the noble republic was a country without state administrative bodies, with an underdeveloped economy, insufficient tax revenues and an army that was neither qualitatively nor numerically equal to the requirements of the time.[1] The aristocratic republic had a wealth of raw materials and was therefore interesting for commercial Saxony. In Poland, Polish officials, the Polish Crown Army and the state treasury were subordinate to the Sejm, whose policies were determined by the powerful magnate families and the Szlachta. Their penchant for forming confederations turned the kingdom into a powder keg. The Polish parliament was unable to act due to these private interests (Liberum Veto); the crown itself had only limited income, which was subordinate to the crown treasurer Jan Jerzy Przebendowski. This meant that Poland had an extreme predominance of the estates over the monarch.\n\nElectorate of Saxony[edit]\n\nThe Electorate of Saxony had highly developed manufacturing and crafts. Due to its coherent territory, it was considered a powerful state structure inside the Holy Roman Empire. Saxony was still superior to Brandenburg-Prussia in terms of internal development at the end of the 17th century, but had to cede the Protestant leadership role in the Holy Roman Empire to Brandenburg in the following decades.\n\nCoronation of Elector Friedrich-August as Polish king[edit]\nCoronation of Friedrich-August as Polish king (1790 Painting)\n\nOne driving force behind the attainment of royal dignity was the desire for political sovereignty, which Elector Friedrich-August promised to give further weight in foreign policy. The long-lasting and consolidated dominance of the Habsburg dynasty in the empire encouraged the elector to avoid the threat of a loss of rank and power by increasing his rank in an area that did not belong to the empire. Another important motif was the questions of rank and ceremonies, which at that time indicated the position of power and therefore had immediate political significance. All princes of this time followed the French model of Louis XIV, such as elaborate courtly ceremonies, lavish banquets with opera performances and ballets. The acquisition of the Polish royal crown therefore represented a question of prestige of the first order for Elector Friedrich-August. Because only with a royal crown could a German prince be accepted by the European powers as an equal.\n\nThe Saxon ambassador in Warsaw, Jacob Heinrich von Flemming, had previously succeeded in completely fragmenting the competition by fielding ever new applicants. The efforts of Pope Innocent XI's nephew, Prince Livio Odescalchi, Duke of Bracciano and Ceri, James Louis Sobieski, the son of the former King John III. Sobieski, Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine, Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden, Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria and twelve other candidates were therefore hopeless. François Louis, Prince of Conti who traveled from France for the royal election, was even able to garner a larger number of votes than August, but had to return to his homeland, forced by Saxon troops.\n\nAfter the usual bribes, Elector August the Strong was able to return on 26/27 July. Contrary to all initial expectations, he was elected on the electoral field in Wola in June. On September 15, 1697, he was coronated as August II Mocny in Kraków.\n\nInitial conditions[edit]\nAugustus II the Strong\n\nAfter the coronation, advantageous opportunities arose for both sides. Both sides felt threatened by Prussia and its territorial ambitions. By joining forces between the two countries, this danger could be averted for the time being. Both powers needed mutual support in Northern Europe, where the Prussian, Swedish and Russian armies were far superior to the Saxon and Polish armies. Since Poland-Lithuania was the larger of the two partners, the local nobility had reason enough to believe that they would succeed in protecting their interests. As constitutionalists, they were also more likely to succeed in controlling a foreign ruler than a local one.[2]\n\nDespite the advantages, such as additional dynastic inheritance claims and greater weight in peace negotiations, Saxony was not satisfied with winning the Polish royal crown. Instead, Poland's potential should be made financially and militarily available to the court in Dresden.[3] This was contradicted by the limited powers that a Polish elective king possessed. The Electorate of Saxony could only hope to benefit from the connection with Poland if it managed to acquire a land bridge between the two countries. This hope was dashed with the Prussian annexation of Silesia after 1740. As long as communication, goods traffic and troop movements depended on the good will of Habsburg or Brandenburg-Prussia, Saxony-Poland could not be considered a great power.[4] The idea of a real union between these opposing territories as such was certainly utopian, but the actors still considered a certain unification of the two countries in the areas of administration, military, economics and finance, similar to the core countries in the Habsburg Empire, possible. Points of connection, for example, were Poland's wealth of raw materials and Saxony's manufacturing economy.\n\nHistory of Saxony-Poland[edit]\nSiege of Danzig (1734) by Saxon-Russian troops in the War of the Polish Succession\n\nAfter the occupation of Saxony by the Swedes in the Great Northern War, King August II had to give up the Polish royal title in the Treaty of Altranstädt in 1706 and recognize Stanislaus I Leszczyński, who was supported by Sweden, on the throne. After the Swedish defeat in the Battle of Poltava in 1709, the Saxon Elector was able to regain the throne. After regaining the royal crown, King August II sought to overthrow the Sejm in a coup. His representatives called for the Saxon army to be merged with the Polish Crown Army. Polish fortresses had been occupied and arrests made as early as 1713. Since this would have been a first step towards the establishment of an absolutist hereditary monarchy in Poland, it provoked the uprising of the Tarnogród Confederacy in 1715/16, led by Stanisław Ledóchowski and Jan Klemens Branicki, which put August at risk of his throne. It was mainly a revolt of the small nobility against the king; Important magnates such as Lithuania's hetman Ludwik Pociej (a friend of Peter the Great) tended to try to mediate. Although the Saxon troops remained victorious in all major battles, they were unable to end the uprising, so money began to run out. King August II accepted the Tsar's mediation and achieved only partial success in the Peace of Warsaw in 1716 and the Silent Sejm in 1717. In return, the Saxon army had to leave the country.\n\nPainting of Warsaw by Canaletto (ca. 1770)\n\nAfter 1716, there were signs of a certain stabilization of August II's government in Poland, which made some reforms possible - but there was no prospect of reforms in the spirit of absolutism. Several Imperial Diets collapsed, and King August II tried unsuccessfully to secure the succession of the Electoral Prince as the next Polish king. At least Poland recovered economically from the effects of the Great Northern War in the 1920s. The feudal nobility could produce intensively, and the exchange of goods between Poland and Saxony, promoted by the Leipzig Trade Fair and facilitated by customs agreements, increased. The raw materials preferably came from Poland and finished products from Saxony. Palaces, parks and numerous new churches showed that Poland still had resources. But the aristocratic republic, which was constantly in internal blockage and power struggles, lacked the will and coherence to make something of it. A central economic and financial policy could not be implemented in Poland, a large part of the taxes (up to 20%) were stuck in the collection system and mercantilist thinking was limited to the self-interest of the magnate families.\n\nIn addition to the lengthy and frustrating reform work in Poland, the permanent securing of Wettin rule in Poland played an important role in the politics of August II. A first step in this direction was taken in 1733 when Elector Friedrich August II, the son of August II, with the support of Austria and Russia and the usual bribes against the candidate of Sweden and France, Stanisław Leszczyński, was elected King of Poland. This triggered the War of the Polish Succession. Friedrich August II was crowned King of Poland as Augustus III of Poland on January 17, 1734 and claimed the crown in the Peace of Vienna (1738). Given this situation, the king and his prime minister Heinrich von Brühl hoped to control Poland with the “ministerial system” of magnates loyal to Saxony (who were placed in key positions) and tried to politically connect the two countries. During the Seven Years' War they even obtained the consent of their three allies for a renewed Polish crown candidacy for the Saxons, but the successes did not last.\n\nIn Saxony, after the fall of Aleksander Józef Sułkowski, Heinrich von Brühl led the government from 1738 to 1756, and in 1746 he formally became prime minister. He was a successful diplomat and consolidated the administration, but was sharply attacked in the state parliament in 1749 because of his financial policies. Despite Brühl's ruthless financial measures, the Electorate of Saxony was heading into crisis. The economy was damaged, the Saxon army, which was already too small, had to be disarmed and a significant portion of the taxes had to be pledged. There was also pressure from outside, as Saxon exports were severely hindered by the Prussian (customs) policy of the time.\n\nThe destruction of the Dresden Kreuzkirche by Prussian cannonade in the Seven Years' War in 1760 (Canaletto, 1765)\n\nBut it was the Seven Years' War that brought Saxony's collapse in 1756. The Saxon army, which was too small, surrendered without a fight at Lilienstein under Count Rutowski, King August III. and his court moved to Warsaw, where they remained in relative political powerlessness until the end of the war. The Electorate of Saxony, now provisionally administered by the Kingdom of Prussia and some cabinet ministers, became a theater of war and suffered. When the Seven Years' War ended with the Peace of Hubertusburg in 1763, the Electorate of Saxony, which had previously been quite prosperous, was ruined. Saxony also had no influence whatsoever on the awarding of the Polish crown: Poland-Lithuania had come under Russian hegemony more than ever; as successor to August III. Stanisław August Poniatowski was appointed by Empress Catherine the Great, ending the personal union between Saxony and Poland.\n\nOutcome of the union[edit]\n\nSaxon rule over Poland remained loose, so that the separation of Poland from Saxony in 1706 and 1763 did not tear apart any structures that had grown together. There were attempts to expand the Saxony-Poland personal union into a real state union. There were plans in Poland to establish a Saxon succession. However, these efforts did not lead anywhere. The Electorate of Saxony had clearly overextended itself despite the additional reputation that the Polish crown brought. The economy, administration and army stagnated due to the additional burdens caused by the enormous additional expenditure on art and representation. There was a lack of a consistent economic policy towards manufacturers in Saxony. Regional planning and improvement of agriculture were also neglected in Saxony. Saxony also lagged behind the neighboring powers in the further development of its military.\n\nWith August's conversion to Catholicism, Saxony lost its leading role among the Protestant imperial estates to Brandenburg-Prussia. However, August renounced the use of the instrument cuius regio, eius religio, which would have enabled him to re-catholize Saxony or at least emancipate the Catholic religion. He instead assured his Saxon subjects in the religious insurance decree of 1697 (renewed by his son in 1734) that his conversion to the Catholicism has no consequences for them. Nevertheless, the change of faith, which only occurred as a result of power-political calculations, alienated the sovereign from his Protestant subjects.\n\nThe “Polish adventure” of their sovereign cost the Saxons dearly. Huge amounts of bribes flowed from the Saxon state treasury to the Polish nobility and to Polish church dignitaries (around 39 million Reichstaler during August's reign). King August II even sold some not insignificant Saxon lands and rights for this purpose.\n\nIn Poland, this period, in which the Wettin dynasty ruled for 66 years, is also known as the Saxon period. The majority sees this time as negative for Poles. The decadent mood of that time was remembered, which became a symbol of the late Sarmatian aristocratic culture with its lavish celebrations and the lack of sense of responsibility among the majority of the magnates towards their own state. Due to the weakening of the Rzeczpospolita, the partitions of Poland occurred a few years later.\n\nIn Saxony, however, people speak of the Augustan age.[5] At this time, Saxony was one of the more important powers in Europe. The Dresden Baroque reached its peak in the residential city of Dresden, and the Dresden art collections achieved European-wide importance. The end of the Augustan Age is considered to be the conclusion of the Treaty of Dresden in 1745 or the end of the Seven Years' War in 1763, which almost coincided with the death of King August II and thus the end of the Saxon-Polish personal union.\n\nAftermath[edit]\n\nThe constitution of May 3, 1791, passed by the Sejm as a result of the first partition of Poland, stipulated that the respective “ruling Elector of Saxony should rule as king in Poland”. Elector Friedrich August III. However, due to the political situation, renounced the Polish crown. Through Napoleon and the Confederation of the Rhine, the Saxon Electorate became a kingdom in 1806, and in 1807 Friedrich August was also named Duke of Warsaw. The constitution dictated by Napoleon for the Duchy of Warsaw linked the Warsaw dukedom hereditarily to the Saxon royal family, but ended along with Napoleon's power in 1815.\n\nAfter the failed November Uprising in 1830, many Polish emigrants came to Saxony, whose graves can still be found, for example, in the old Catholic cemetery in Dresden. Saxony willingly accepted the refugees. During the Polish uprisings against Russian, Prussian and Austrian rule between 1830 and 1863, prayers were publicly held in Dresden for a Polish victory.\n\nLiterature[edit]\nHans-Jürgen Bömelburg: Die Wettiner und die sächsischen Eliten in Polen-Litauen.

He was a Pakistan movement activist and some acts of nationalism in his student life in India are noted.\n\nEarly Life[edit]\n\nZahirul Hasnain Lari was born in Lar,Uttar Pradesh India on 17 January 1907. He was born to parents (Father Abdus Shakoor) who belonged to the historic local Muslim community Iraqi Biradari. [1]. He was educated at Aligarh Muslim University Aligarh, receiving respectively, a B.A. (1927) degree, M.A., LL.B. (1930) degree and he was a notable alumnus. [2] [3] After graduation in Law, Zahirul Hasnain practiced as a lawyer at Gorakhpur district court. He enrolled as an Advocate in the High Court Allahabad where his family lived before migration to Pakistan in 1950.\n\nPolitical Life[edit]\n\n1937 Indian Provincial Elections under Government of India 1935 Act: Muslim League President Jinnah took a nationalist stance and emulated the Congress electoral campaign and appointed Muslim League Parliamentary Boards for the 1937 elections. The aforementioned strategy did not work as the Muslim League barely won 29 seats from the Muslim-reserved 66 seats or 29 in total U.P. assembly seats 288. [4]. On the other hand, the Congress Party won a simple majority of 138 to form the government. Zahirul Hasnain won the 1937 U.P. Legislative Assembly election from Gorakhpur reserved seat. [5] As an important Muslim League leader from United Province he served the deputy leader of the opposition post in U.P. Legislative Assembly.\n\nU.P. Legislative Assembly Elections before 1947: Zahirul Hasnain was re-elected to the U.P. Assembly in 1946 and became Deputy Leader of the Opposition (1946-1948). It is noteworthy that the 1946 election was fought with a different strategy under Zahirul Hasnain as secretary of the parliamentary board of the Muslim League. The result of this election was astonishing e.g. United Provinces||66||54||82%). [6] In general Muslim League with the new strategy won the most seats from Muslim reserved seats in every province including Muslim majority provinces, Punjab and Bengal. Thus, the 1946 election was effectively a plebiscite where the Indian Muslims were to vote on the creation of Pakistan. It is noted that Zahirul Hasnain Lari, secretary of the UP Muslim League Parliamentary Board in 1946, intervened on unity/or partition issues in the same assembly before.[7]\n\nConstituent Assembly of India: The British government planned an early election in provinces which took place in 1946. It was planned that these provincial assemblies then elect a new Constituent Assembly before the independence of India. Zahirul Hasnain Lari was appointed to the Constituent Assembly from the United Provinces on a Muslim League ticket.[8] He made important interventions in the debates on cultural, educational rights of minorities, and the right to life and liberty and hoped those changes are incorporated in the constitution.[9] Lari (n 58). Lari’s assessment also encompassed the provincial legislatures, which though followed a parliamentary system, lacked an active opposition: “I find that in all the legislatures in the Provinces, there is no Opposition has been dwindling. In our own Dominion legislature, there is no Opposition whatsoever and the result has been only tall talk somewhere at some places by certain individuals. ZH Lari, Vol. VIII Constituent Assembly Debates (20 May 1949). 52 ibid. 53 ... Muslim League led the movement for the creation of Pakistan. [10]\n\nMigration[edit]\n\nHe resigned from the Assembly in 1949. In May 1950, Lari migrated to Pakistan. He was appointed as the additional judge of the Sindh Chief Court till December 1952. Later, he resigned from this post to join the Karachi bar.[11]\n\nSee Also[edit]\nNasreen Jalil, Pakistani senator\nYasmeen Lari, the first female architect in Pakistan\nDeath[edit]\n\nZahirul Hasnain Lari died on 13 March 1972 in Karachi.\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ Shajra Iraqi Biradran of eastern Uttar Pradesh by Jalil Ahmad Lari; Javed Ahmad Gauri; Tabrez Akhtar Lari (2022). \"APNO KI TALASH FINAL Book Urdu\".

He worked as a military surgeon during the Crimean War and the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78. In 1879, he was assigned to an envoy to Russia and worked to solve the disputes over the status of Armenians in Caucasus. In 1882, he worked as a scholar at the Imperial School of Medicine. His field of research included infectious diseases, military psychiatry and anatomy. He contributed to Turkish language by offering equivalents for Western medical terms. He was rewarded the Crimea Medal in 1855 and the Order of the Medjidie in 1856.\n\nLife[edit]\n\nSeferyan was born to an upper-middle-class Armenian family in Smyrna (İzmir) in 1820. His father worked as a supervisor in a textile factory and acted as a middleman for foreign traders. His mother was well-educated and worked in the local charity. Seferyan enrolled in the Mesropyan College in 1830. He could speak Armenian, Turkish, Greek and French. In 1840, he tried to enroll in the Naval Medical School (Tersane Tıp Mektebi) but his application was denied because of his lack of familiarity with Italian. In 1841, he instead attended the newly founded Imperial School of Medicine. In 1844, he graduated and returned to his family in Smyrna. He started working in Surp Lusavorçyan Hospital and guided nurses for more effective forms of treatment by instructing them on hygiene and gathering statistics about the patients.[1][2]\n\nWhen the Crimean War broke out in 1853, Seferyan volunteered in the Imperial Army. He was deployed as a military surgeon at the Danubian Frontier under Omer Pasha.[3] He treated the wounded soldiers in Varna and helped with the transportation of military supplies. His work was well received by the command, and he on 24 March 1854 he was promoted to the rank of kolağası (Senior Captain). Later, he was transferred to Crimean Peninsula and worked at the garrison in Yevpatoria. In 1855, he was decorated with the Turkish Crimea Medal. In 1856, he was rewarded the Order of the Medjidie by the Sultan himself. He attempted to rehabilitate traumatized soldiers and published his research after the war.[4]\n\nIn 1856, Seferyan attended the National Academy of Medicine in Paris for higher learning and earned his doctorate four years later. He returned Turkey in 1861 and continued working in the medical sector. With the outbreak of the Russian-Turkish War in 1877, Seferyan was appointed as the head of the Surp Pırgiç Hospital in Constantinople.[5] In 1879, he was assigned to the Turkish consulate in Russian-controlled Erevan to resolve the dispute about the status of Ottoman Armenians in territories ceded to Russia with the Treaty of Berlin. The mission sought the protection of Armenians against Kurdish lords and determined the authority of the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople.[6][7]\n\nIn 1890, Kalemciyan retired from the profession and settled in the countryside in Smyrna. From this point on, there is a lack of detail about his later years. In his memoirs, he mentions that he was living under handsome conditions and that he had 7 children, of whom 2 died during birth. On 30 May 1899, he passed away of natural causes.[8][9]\n\nWorks[edit]\nتاریخ طبيه عثمانیه [Târîh-i Tıbbiye-yi Osmaniye / The Ottoman Medical History] (in Ottoman Turkish).

The screenplay is based on the motifs of Pavlović's short story Legends and Antonije Isaković's short story For the Third Time.\n\nPlot[edit]\n\nThe story takes place in 1945, near the end of the Second World War in Serbia, at a time when the newly formed communist government still had to deal with backward groups of Chetniks. The protagonist, Ive Vrana, is a young Dalmatian and member of SKOJ who believes in revolution and a higher goal. Ive's father was killed by Italian soldiers, causing him to move in with his relatives in Serbia to continue his high school education. He first encounters an obstacle when his girlfriend, Milica, is singled out as a bourgeoisie class traitor due to her upbringing. He also witnesses the drunk and reckless behaviour of partisan leader Zeka. Tensions increase as the local partisans fight and attempt to capture Marko, a Chetnik leader. Ive's idealism increasingly clashes with reality and the fact that his own side is also carrying out reckless and violent repression. He joins the ranks of OZNA, but finds himself even more disillusioned by an opportunistic officer's lies and the violence around him, as well as relationships, as Milica cheats on him with her PE teacher. Frustrated, Ive goes on a walk outside the village, but is captured by partisans who mistake him for a Chetnik and kill him when he is unable to provide documentation.\n\nCast[edit]\nIvica Vidović as Ive Vrana\nMilena Dravić as Milica\nSeverin Bijelić as Zeka\nSlobodan Aligrudić as Jotić\nPavle Vuisić as village elder\nMilivoje Tomić as class teacher\nDragomir Felba as Topolovački\nLjubomir Ćipranić as priest\nBranko Milićević as SKOJ leader\nMarija Milutinović as Slavka\nMirjana Blašković as Milanka\nMirjana Nikolić as teacher\nAlenka Rančić as friend with glasses\nBranko Obradović as col.

The Ambush is also on that list.[5]\n\nRestoration[edit]\n\nIn 2023, the Yugoslav Film Archive, in cooperation with Centar Film, digitally restored The Ambush. The film was shown at the European project \"Season of Film Classics\". The restored version premiered at the Archive on December 28th, 2023.[6]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ Zaseda (in Serbian), retrieved 2023-12-30\n^ \nJump up to:\na b \"16.

Litti Chokha, traditionally, was served as just two items, Litti and Chokha, but as a dish it has evolved to have more accompaniments like salad, pickle etc. It is a popular street food in small towns and cities in north India. Many restaurants also serve the dish including 5 star hotels like Radisson[1][2]\n\nPreparation[edit]\n\nThere are many ways to prepare Litti Chokha. It is prepared differently depending on the kind of utensils and oven you have. It also depends on if it is prepared at home or by vendors or at restaurants. Each has different taste and flavor.\n\nAt home preparation[edit]\n\nOne such recipe posted by Times Of India[3] states:\n\nOne such recipe posted by Times to prepare it at home:\n\nStep 1 Prepare the dough for litti\n\nTo prepare the dough, take a mixing bowl and add wheat flour, mustard oil and a pinch of salt. Add some water and knead a soft dough.\n\nStep 2 Preparing the filling of litti\n\nTo prepare the filling, take a bowl and mix sattu (black gram flour), pickle masala, mustard oil, lemon juice, kalonji, ginger, coriander leaves, green chillies, and salt together. Preheat oven to 180 degrees Celsius. Now divide the dough, flatten to the desired size and place a spoonful of the filling. Close the dough by the edges and roll it into a ball.\n\nStep 3 The right way to bake littis\n\nPut these balls on a baking tray and bake. Then flip to the other side and bake till it is cooked properly. Put your oven on broil mode for 2-3 minutes turning both sides to get a crisp covering.\n\nStep 4 Let's learn how to prepare the chokha for litti\n\nNow to prepare the chokha, wash, dry and slit the brinjal. Put an aluminium foil on the baking tray and place the brinjal and tomatoes on top. Roast them on broil mode or highest temperature. Once done, peel the brinjal and tomatoes and then mash them well. Transfer these into a bowl. Add garlic, salt, mustard oil, lemon juice, green chillis and chopped green coriander leaves in the bowl. Mix the ingredients well and the chokha is ready to be served.\n\nStep 5 Enjoy the delicious Litti Chokha\n\nTransfer the chokha to a serving bowl. Dip the litti balls in some melted ghee and place along with the chokha. You can also serve this dish with some kadhi or chicken/mutton curry. Enjoy the burst of flavours of this authentic Bihari delicacy, rate it and let us know how it turned out to be.\n\nPreparation by street vendors[edit]\n\nStreet Vendors however prepare Litti in a Barbeque style.\n\nLitti Preparation In Barbeque Style\n\nThe Litti prepared in Barbeque style has more flavor and tasty, but it is difficult to make it at home because these days very few people have coal-fired oven.\n\nPopularity[edit]\n\nLitti-chokha was selected to represent the country under the banner of National Association of Streetfood Vendors of India (NASVI) at the five-day event in the Philippines capital, Manila.[4][5]\n\nBollywood actor Aamir Khan, who was in the Bihar capital (Patna) in 2014 to promote his film PK, visited a roadside shop and enjoyed Bihari delicacy litti-chokha. Aamir told the media he enjoyed the special taste of litti-chokha. It is known for its unique taste. I love to eat litti-chokha.[6]\n\nLitti Chokha is also served in Indian Restaurants abroad such as Bay Area. Pippal, among others, serves it to delight their customers[7][8]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ https://www.facebook.com/RadissonBluHotelGreaterNoida/posts/you-wont-miss-a-thingexperience-the-luxury-on-wheels-we-are-open-for-food-delive/4287120358004976/\n^ https://www.cnbctv18.com/travel/food-and-drinks/biryani-to-litti-chokha-dig-into-the-diverse-cuisine-of-uttar-pradesh-in-this-food-festival-17808071.htm\n^ \"Litti Chokha Recipe: How to make Litti Chokha Recipe at Home | Homemade Litti Chokha Recipe - Times Food\". recipes.timesofindia.com.
