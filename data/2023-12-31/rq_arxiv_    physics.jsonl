In [19] there is an approach to the investigation of the pseud o-\ncontinuability of Schur functions in terms of Schur paramet ers.

The main object in the approach is based on co nsidering\na Schur function as characteristic function of a contractio n (see Sec-\ntion 1.2). This enables us outgoing from Schur parameters to construct\na model of the corresponding contraction (see Section 2). In this model,\nthe relative position of the largest shift and the largest co shift in a com-\npletely nonunitary contraction is described in Section 3 an d then, based\non this model, to ﬁnd characteristics which are responsible for the pseu-\ndocontinuability of Schur functions (see Sections 4 and 5).

In 1974, Kaplinskaja classiﬁed all simplicial straight hyp erbolic\nCoxeter prisms. In this paper, we determine precisely which of these prisms\nare properly quasi-arithmetic or arithmetic. We also prese nt some observations\nregarding commensurability classes and systoles of the ass ociated orbifolds.\nFinally, we show that there is a cocompact properly quasi-ar ithmetic reﬂection\ngroup in H3preserving an isotropic quadratic form. This phenomenon wa s\npreviously known due to Vinberg only in dimension 2.\n1.Introduction\nThis paper concerns arithmetic properties of hyperbolic Coxeter prisms , that\nis, ﬁnite-volume hyperbolic Coxeter polyhedra combinatorially equiva lent to the\nproduct of a simplex and a segment. Recall that hyperbolic Coxeter polyhedra, i.e.\nconvex polyhedra with dihedral angles of the form π/m, are canonical fundamental\ndomains for discrete groups generated by reﬂections in hyperplan es of hyperbolic\n(or Lobachevsky) spaces Hn.\nAny prism has precisely two simplicial facets, its bases. In contrast to the Eu-\nclidean setting, a hyperbolic Coxeter prism can have at most one bas e orthogonal\nto all adjacent facets. In the presence of such a base, which is ne cessarily compact,\nthe prism is said to be straight. Any hyperbolic Coxeter prism can be cut into two\nstraight prisms sharing a common such base; in particular, since com pact Coxeter\nsimplices do not exist in H≥5, ﬁnite-volume hyperbolic Coxeter prisms cease to\nexist in dimensions ≥6.\nCompact and ﬁnite-volume straight hyperbolic Coxeter prisms were classiﬁed by\nKaplinskaja[ 18]in1974;seeTable 1. InH3, theseprismsprovidenotjust aninﬁnite\nfamily of Coxeter polyhedra, but even inﬁnitely many commensurability classes of\nﬁnite-covolume reﬂection groups. On the other hand, in H4andH5there are only\nﬁnitely many such prisms. Our goal is to precisely determine which hyp erbolic\nreﬂection groups associated to straight Coxeter prisms are (quasi-)arithmetic .\nA hyperbolic lattice Γ <Isom(Hn) =Gis said to be quasi-arithmetic if there is\na totally real number ﬁeld k⊂Rand ak-groupGsuch that G(R) is isogenous to\nGwith Γ virtually contained in G(k) via this isogeny, but Gσ(R) is compact for\nevery non-identity embedding σ:k→R. In this case, the adjoint trace ﬁeld of Γ\ncoincides with k, and Γ is arithmetic if and only if it is commensurable to G(Ok)\nwhereOkis the ring of integers of the ﬁeld k. The latter condition is equivalent to\ntr(Adγ)∈ Okfor eachγ∈Γ where Ad denotes the adjoint representationofthe Lie\ngroupG. We saythat alattice Γ is properly quasi-arithmetic if it is quasi-arithmetic\nbut not arithmetic. We will conﬂate reﬂection groups, their fundam ental Coxeter\npolyhedra and associated reﬂective orbifolds (i.e. quotients of Hnby reﬂection\ngroups) when speaking about their arithmetic or group-theoretic properties.\n12 NIKOLAY BOGACHEV AND KHUSRAV YOROV\nThe notion of quasi-arithmeticity was ﬁrst suggested by Vinberg in 1 967 in his\nfundamental work [ 28] on hyperbolic reﬂection groups where, applying his original\ntechniques, he provided several properly quasi-arithmetic reﬂec tion groups in Hn\nforn= 3,4,5. We would like to stress that some hyperbolic Coxeter prisms were\namong those examples. Moreover, even earlier, in 1966, Makarov [ 20] provided the\nﬁrst examples of nonarithmetic lattices in Isom( H3) via ﬁnite-volume noncompact\nCoxeter prisms. This remarkable work of Makarov motivated furth er study (initi-\nated by Vinberg) of hyperbolic reﬂection groups and their arithmet ic properties.\nIt is well known that there are many nonarithmetic hyperbolic lattice s, includ-\ning some constructions that apply in all dimensions n/greaterorequalslant2. The ﬁrst is due to\nGromov and Piatetski–Shapiro [ 17] (see also Raimbault [ 25] and Gelander–Levit\n[16]), who constructed nonarithmetic hyperbolic hybridsby gluing pairwise incom-\nmensurable arithmetic blocks. Later, Thomson [ 27] observed that such hybrids are\nnot quasi-arithmetic. Other nonarithmetic lattices were construc ted by Agol [ 1],\nBelolipetsky–Thomson[ 4], andBergeron–Haglund–Wise[ 5](seealsoMila[ 22]), giv-\ning rise to ﬁnite-volume hyperbolic manifolds with arbitrarily small systole. This\nconstruction produces properly quasi-arithmetic hyperbolic lattic es as was also\nshown by Thomson [ 27], allowing him to distinguish these two classes of nonar-\nithmetic lattices even up to commensurability. It is also worth mention ing that\nDouba [13] recently provided another family of hyperbolic manifolds with small\nsystoles which are not quasi-arithmetic and thus are not commensu rable to those\nconstructed by Agol, Belolipetsky–Thomson, and Bergeron–Haglu nd–Wise,but are\ncreated by taking hybrids of the manifolds constructed by the latt er authors.\nTo conclude the discussion of quasi-arithmetic hyperbolic lattices in a general\nsetting, we mention the following two results.

It is challenging to identify appropri-\nate constraint specifications due to the unde-\nfined trade-off between the reward maximiza-\ntion objective and the constraint satisfaction,\nwhich is ubiquitous in constrained decision-\nmaking. To tackle this issue, we propose a\nnew constrained RL approach that searches\nfor policy and constraint specifications to-\ngether. This method features the adaptation\nof relaxing the constraint according to a re-\nlaxation cost introduced in the learning objec-\ntive. Since this feature mimics how ecological\nsystems adapt to disruptions by altering op-\neration, our approach is termed as resilient\nconstrained RL. Specifically, we provide a set\nof sufficient conditions that balance the con-\nstraint satisfaction and the reward maximiza-\ntion in notion of resilient equilibrium, propose\na tractable formulation of resilient constrained\npolicy optimization that takes this equilib-\nrium as an optimal solution, and advocate two\nresilient constrained policy search algorithms\nwith non-asymptotic convergence guarantees\non the optimality gap and constraint satis-\nfaction. Furthermore, we demonstrate the\nmerits and the effectiveness of our approach\nin computational experiments.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nConstrained reinforcement learning (RL) is a con-\nstrained control problem in which an agent aims to\nPreliminary work.maximize its expected cumulative reward while satisfy-\ning a given constraint by interacting with an environ-\nment over time. Multiple requirements are of growing\ninterest in constrained RL towards designing an agent\nto meet more than one constraint, e.g., resource allo-\ncation for many users [ De Nijs et al., 2021 ] and safe\nlearning in robotics [ Brunke et al., 2022 ]. Real-world\nconstrained RL often engages practical problems with\nunwell-specified requirements, e.g., human-satisfaction\nin human-robot interaction [ El-Shamouty et al., 2020 ]\nand safety level of robotic agents [ Zhang et al., 2020 ].\nHence, it is challenging to determine reasonable con-\nstraint specifications for making trade-off between re-\nward maximization and constraint satisfaction.\nAlthough reward shaping has been widely used to ag-\ngregate multiple requirements into a single reward,\ne.g., [ P´ erez-D’Arpino et al., 2021 ], it doesn’t guarantee\nconstraint satisfaction for each requirement. A known\nreason for this single-reward failure is that the solutions\ngenerated by standard RL algorithms do not necessarily\nsatisfy required constraints, which is known as “scalar-\nization fallacy” [ Szepesv´ ari, 2020 ,Zahavy et al., 2021 ,\nCalvo-Fullana et al., 2023 ]. Therefore, it is cru-\ncial to directly impose the constraints that re-\nsult from multiple requirements [ Roy et al., 2022 ],\nwhich has been studied by a lot of recent ef-\nforts, e.g., [ Chow et al., 2017 ,Paternain et al., 2019 ,\nDing et al., 2020 ]. However, such results are based\non known feasible constraints, not applicable in the\nsituations with unknown constraint specifications.\nTo fill this gap, we aim to automate the constraint\nspecifications during constrained RL training by fa-\ncilitating the trade-off between reward maximization\nand constraint satisfaction. The focal RL environ-\nment of this paper is the constrained Markov decision\nprocess (MDP) that constrains expected cumulative\nutilities [ Altman, 1999 ], which has been widely-used in\nmany constraint-rich domains, e.g., resource allocation,\nrobotic planning, and financial management; see more\nin [Garcıa and Fern´ andez, 2015 ,De Nijs et al., 2021 ,\nGu et al., 2022, Brunke et al., 2022].arXiv:2312.17194v1  [math.OC]  28 Dec 2023Resilient Constrained Reinforcement Learning\nContribution. Our contributions are threefold.\n•We first introduce nominal constraints that are\npossibly infeasible, so that they can be relaxed to\ncompromise reward maximization for constraint\nsatisfaction. We provide the sensitivity analysis\nof the optimal reward value function to the per-\nturbations in constraints. Since the compromise\nmimics how ecological systems adapt to disrup-\ntions by changing operating conditions, we term\nthis as resilient constrained policy optimization,\nand broadly as resilient constrained RL.\n•To specify the levels or thresholds of constraints,\nwe introduce a user-defined cost function that es-\ntablishes a price for relaxing nominal constraints,\nand exploit the relative difficulty of relaxing dif-\nferent constraints to define a trade-off solution:\nresilient equilibrium. We provide a tractable for-\nmulation of resilient constrained policy optimiza-\ntion that takes this equilibrium as an optimal\nsolution, and establish its duality theory under\nless restrictive feasibility assumption.\n•To find"}

(3)\nIn particular, one has νκ→0 asκ→ ∞.\nEmail address: frederic.ouimet2@mcgill.ca (Fr´ ed´ eric Ouimet)\n1The main goal of the present paper (Theorem 1) is to establish a local asymptotic expansion,\nasκ→ ∞, for the log-ratio of the von Mises density ( 1) to the (linear) Normal( µ,2ν2\nκ) density,\nviz.,\n1√\n2νκφ/parenleftbiggδx√\n2/parenrightbigg\n,whereφ(z):=exp(−z2/2)√\n2πandδx:=x−µ/radicalbig\n1−I1(κ)/I0(κ).(4)\nNotice the extra scaling factor√\n2 for the (linear) standard deviation in ( 4). This factor would\nnot appear if the expected limiting distribution was the usual Normal (µ,ν2\nκ) distribution.\nTo explain the extra scaling factor, consider a wrapped normal dist ribution with mean direc-\ntionµ∈[0,2π) and scaling parameter σ∈(0,∞), henceforth denoted by WNormal( µ,σ2). Its\ndensity function is given by the inﬁnite sum\ngµ,v2(θ) =∞/summationdisplay\nk=−∞1\nσ√\n2πexp/braceleftbigg\n−1\n2σ2(θ−µ+2πk)2/bracerightbigg\n, θ∈[0,2π), (5)\nsee, e.g., p. 50-51 of Mardia & Jupp (2000) or Section 2.2.6 of Jammalamadaka & SenGupta\n(2001); it has the same support as the von Mises distribution. The WNorma l(µ,σ2) distribution\ncan be visualized as a Normal( µ,σ2) distribution “folded” onto the unit circle. When the scaling\nparameter σof the underlying normal distribution is small, most of the distribution ’s mass will be\nlocated near the mean direction µ, minimizing the “wrapping” eﬀect. Indeed, the expression ( 5)\nessentially sums the normal densities from each “wrap” around the circle. For a small σ, the\nmajority of the distribution’s weight is around the mean direction µ, and the contributions from\nterms with k/ne}ationslash= 0 (i.e., terms from subsequent wraps around the circle) will be minima l. It is well\nknown to be a limiting distribution of the von Mises( µ,κ) distribution when the concentration\nparameter κtends to inﬁnity, see Kent(1978) or Eq. (3.5.24) of Mardia & Jupp (2000) for details.\nThe circular expectation and variance of Θ ∼WNormal( µ,σ2) are\nCE(Θ)≡arg{E(eiΘ)}=µandCVar(Θ)≡1−E{cos(Θ−µ)}= 1−exp(−σ2/2).\nThe circular variance provides a measure of the dispersion of the dis tribution on the circle and\nis derived using the so-called mean resultant length, see, e.g., Sectio n 2.3.1 of Mardia & Jupp\n(2000). For small σ, the mean resultant length is close to 1. Speciﬁcally, when σ2is small, one\nhas the ﬁrst-order Taylor approximation\nCVar(Θ) = 1−exp(−σ2/2)≈σ2\n2=/parenleftbiggσ√\n2/parenrightbigg2\n,\nwhere the aforementioned extra scaling factor√\n2 appears again. The asymptotic relationship\nbetweenthecircularvarianceofthevonMisesdistributionandthec orrespondinglimitingwrapped\nnormal distributions is therefore\nνκ=σ√\n2,or equivalently, σ=√\n2νκ.\nThis explains the extra scaling factor√\n2 in (4); it serves as a pivotal scaling relationship between\nthe unit circle and the real line. In essence, it accounts for the add itional variance caused by the\nsubsequent wraps ( k/ne}ationslash= 0) around the unit circle. This connectio"}

Introduction\nSnell’s law of refraction [7, Chapter 1] describes the trajectory of a ray when passing\nfrom one medium to another. The interface separating both media creates a discontinuity\nin the refractive index causing a change in the direction of the propagating radiation. Due\nto recent technological advances, metasurfaces were introduced in optical designs. These\nare ultra-thin artificially engineered materials composed of nano-structures that introduce\nabrupt phase shifts along the optical path to bend light in non-standard ways [1]. The\ncorresponding generalized Snell’s law was derived and verified in multiple papers in\noptical engineering for example [41] and [42] in two dimensions. The three-dimensional\ncorresponding law is proved in [21] using the Fermat principle and in [22] from the\ndistributional Maxwell system.\nIn this paper, we study two inverse problems in Geometric Optics involving hybrid\nlenses composed of a standard refracting surface and a flat metasurface. We first study\nthe existence of such a lens refracting a variable incident field of directions emitted from a\nplanar source into a predefined constant direction, see Figure 1. We assume that the face\ncloser to the source is a given conventional refracting surface and that the other face of the\nlens is the flat metasurface. The goal is to analyze the existence of a phase discontinuity\nin a neighborhood of every point on the metasurface so that all rays leave the lens along\na given constant direction. To do this, we use the standard and the generalized Snell’s\nlaws to reduce the problem into a system of partial di fferential equations and show that\nthe incident field must satisfy a curl condition (3.2.1). Assuming (3.2.1), we employ the\nimplicit function theorem and the notion of envelop to find a su fficient condition on the\nlower face of the lens and the incident field so that the required phase discontinuity exists.\nThe considered model in this part is a non-imaging far-field inverse problem where we\nare not interested in creating an image but rather in the direction of the rays leaving the\nlens.\nUsing the far-field analysis, we next consider the following imaging problem in the\nnear-field case. Given a bijective map Tbetween a planar source and a planar target,\nour goal is to find a hybrid lens that achieves T. In other words, every point in the\nsource emits a ray that is refracted by the lens into its corresponding image defined by\nT. The rays entering and leaving the lens are assumed vertical see Figure 2. In this\nmodel, we show that the lower face of the lens satisfies a system of semilinear partial\ndifferential equations (4.2.2) and find in Theorem 4.2 conditions on Tso that a solution\nexists. Once the lower face is found, the existence of the phase discontinuity will be\ndeduced from the far-field analysis requiring additional conditions on the map T, see\nTheorem 4.7. We apply this analysis in Section 4.4 to several examples in particular when\nTis a magnification /contraction, and when |T−I|is constant.x\nWe put our results in perspective both from the mathematical and optical points of\nview.

This\npropertydatesbacktoPoincaré[Poi99],whoaskedifthedynamicalsystemsthatariseincelestial\nmechanics satisfy a closing property. In modern dynamics, this problem was revisited by\nPeixoto [Pei88], Pugh [Pug67a,Pug67b] and Pugh-Robinson [PR83], who proved the 𝐶1-closing\nproperty for smooth systems, Hamiltonian systems and in several other settings.\nFigure 1. The closing property states that nearly closed orbits can be closed by\nsome small perturbation, akin to the introduction of a planet with small mass.\nThese landmark results were followed by a relative lull, as examples due to Pugh [Pug75],\nHernandez[Her79],Robinson[Gut87]andHerman[Her91a,Her91b]showedthat 𝐶2andhigher\nclosing properties do not hold at the level of generality of the 𝐶1version. Despite this, Smale\nincluded the 𝐶8-closing property as the 10th problem in his influential problem list [Sma98].\nOverthelastdecade,thesituationchangeddramaticallyduetoworkofIrie[Iri15],whoused\nFloer theory to prove a strong version of the 𝐶8closing property for Reeb flows on closed\ncontact 3-manifolds. This breakthrough spurred a flurry of recent activity at the intersection\nof dynamics and symplectic geometry, resulting in a smooth closing property for Hamiltonian\nsurface maps [AI16] and area preserving surface maps [CGPZ21,EH21], along with several\nequidistribution results [Iri18,Pra21].\nThe main tools in the works following Irie are spectral invariants coming from embedded\ncontact homology (ECH) [Hut10] and its relatives, which can only be used in low dimensions.\nIn[CDPT22],thepresentauthors,DattaandPrasadtookthefirststepsinapplyingFloertheoretic\nmethods to the study of higher dimensional closing properties, and in particular addressed a\nconjecture of Irie [Iri22].

We point\nout that in this scenario, the PBH abundance would be large enough for at least one object to cross through the\ninner Solar System per decade. Since Solar System ephemerides are modeled and measured to extremely high\nprecision, such close encounters could produce detectable perturbations to orbital trajectories with characteristic\nfeatures. We evaluate this possibility with a suite of simple Solar System simulations, and we argue that the\nabundance of asteroid-mass PBHs can plausibly be probed by existing and near-future data.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nOur Universe contains a substantial amount of dark mat-\nter (DM), per decades-old consensus [1, 2]. Despite well-\nmotivated theoretical models for various particle DM candi-\ndates spanning nearly fifty orders of magnitude in mass (see\ne.g. Refs. [3–7]), there is as yet no direct evidence that DM\nconsists of a new elementary particle species. In recent years,\nan alternative hypothesis has regained traction: that perhaps\nmuch or all of the DM consists of primordial black holes\n(PBHs) [8–10]. Numerous observables restrict the properties\nof PBHs that could account for DM, but a window of about\nsix orders of magnitude in mass remains fully unconstrained.\nFor masses 1017g≲MPBH≲1023g—that is, for masses\ntypical of asteroids—PBHs could account for the entire DM\nabundance. (For recent reviews, see Refs. [11–15].)\nThe constraints at the boundaries of this region are well\nestablished. The upper limit is set by constraints from ex-\ntragalactic microlensing surveys [16, 17]. The lower limit\narises from efficient Hawking evaporation, since high-energy\ncosmic rays emitted by light black holes would be read-\nily detectable [18–24]. (See also Refs. [11–15].) How-\never, the asteroid-mass range has proven difficult to probe.\nOriginally, microlensing constraints were thought to apply\nin this regime as well as at higher masses [25]. However,\nRefs. [16, 17, 26] demonstrated that the effects of wave optics\nand finite source sizes severely weaken lensing constraints be-\nlow1023g.1Moreover, limits from stellar capture estimated\nby Ref. [27] were later weakened by updated arguments in\nRef. [26]. As a result, PBH DM remains largely unconstrained\nin the asteroid-mass regime, and the future of the PBH DM\nhypothesis depends crucially on probes of this portion of the\nparameter space.\nIn this paper, we consider a novel means to probe PBHs\nin the asteroid-mass range. We focus on the effects of PBHs\n∗tungtran@mit.edu\n†sageller@ucsc.edu\n‡benvlehmann@gmail.com\n§dikaiser@mit.edu\n1These effects were later incorporated into an updated version of Ref. [25].on the motions of individual astronomical objects, similarly\nto Refs. [28–30]. In particular, in order to achieve the high-\nest possible sensitivity, we propose the use of the highest-\nprecision astronomical measurements available: Solar System\nephemerides. Given more than five decades of lunar laser-\nranging data [31–33], more than two decades of precision\nmonitoring of Mars orbiters [34, 35], and sophisticated track-\ning of the motions of thousands of smaller objects [36–40],\nour own Solar System is richly instrumented for the detection\nof massive interlopers. We therefore evaluate the observable\neffects of low-mass PBH encounters on the revolutions of the\ncelestial spheres [41].\nIn particular, we study the prospects for detecting perturba-\ntions to the measured distances between Earth and Solar Sys-\ntem objects (SSOs) due to PBH flybys. If they account for all\nof DM, the abundance and phase space distribution of PBHs\ncan be readily determined—and if MPBH lies in the asteroid-\nmass range, then at least several flybys through the Solar Sys-\ntem should be expected to have occurred over the lifetime of\nmodern observing programs. The expected rate of observ-\nable events depends both on the PBH mass distribution and\non the precision with which the motions of various Solar Sys-\ntem objects are presently monitored. As we demonstrate here,\nif the entire DM abundance consists of PBHs with masses\n1018g≲MPBH≲1023g, then Solar System ephemerides\ncould plausibly detect PBH flybys at a rate of order once per\ndecade. This could either enable a quasi-direct detection of\nPBHs or place new constraints in the asteroid-mass range.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we per-\nform a simple order-of-magnitude estimate of the expected ef-\nfects of a PBH transit on Solar System observabl"}

The emission line profiles and SA signals are fit with a slab disk model\nthat allows the eccentricity of the disk and intensity of the emission to vary as power laws. Six of the\nsources are well fit with our model, and three of these sources show asymmetric line profiles that can\nbe fit by adopting a non-zero eccentricity. The three other sources have components in either their line\nprofile or SA signal that are not captured by our disk model. Two of these sources (V892 Tau, CQ Tau)\nhave multi-epoch observations that reveal significant variability. CQ Tau and AB Aur have CO line\nprofiles with centrally-peaked components that are similar to line profiles that have been interpreted\nas evidence of molecular gas arising from a wide-angle disk wind. Alternatively, emission from a\ncircumplanetary disk (CPD) could also account for this component. The interpretations of these\nresults can be clarified in the future with additional epochs that will test the variability timescale of\nthese SA signals. We discuss the utility of using high-resolution spectroscopy for probing the dynamics\nof gas in the disk and the scenarios that can give rise to profiles that are not fit with a simple disk\nmodel.\n1.INTRODUCTION\nAs gas giant planets form, they interact with the disk\nin ways that are expected to produce observable signa-\ntures of their presence. For example, a massive planetwill restrict the flow of material from the outer disk\nacross its orbit and into the inner disk (e.g., Lubow et al.\n1999). This process is expected to result in disks whose\ninner regions reveal evidence of the depletion of dust (i.e.,arXiv:2312.17218v1  [astro-ph.SR]  28 Dec 20232 Jensen et al.\ngapped disks, pre-transitional disks, or transition disks).\nGiant planets can also drive spiral arms in the disk (e.g.,\nFung et al. 2015). Indeed, Dong et al. (2018) point out\nthat direct imaging of nearby Herbig stars indicates that\n∼20−50% of intermediate-mass stars harbor a gas giant\nplanet from beyond ∼30 au.\nWhile the depletion of dust in the inner disk and the\nappearance of spiral arms are enticing signposts of planet\nformation in disks, other effects can give rise to these\nfeatures. For example, Najita et al. (2007b) summarize\nthree other scenarios that can in principle result in a\ntransition disk without the presence of a planet: tidal\ninteractions with a stellar companion, preferential grain\ngrowth in the inner disk, and photoevaporation of the\ndisk. Similarly, stellar flybys can induce spiral patterns in\ndisks (Smallwood et al. 2023). Thus the identification of\na disk whose inner region is cleared or whose disk reveals\nspiral structures is not sufficient to identify the presence\nof a planet in a disk. Unfortunately, direct imaging of gas\ngiant planets in disks has proven difficult. To date, the\nreported detections of forming planets in disks remain\nhotly contested with the exception of PDS 70 bc (Keppler\net al. 2018; M¨ uller et al. 2018; Haffert et al. 2019).\nAn alternative way to search for signposts of planet\nformation is the use of high-resolution spectroscopy\n(R≳25,000) of ro-vibrational molecular emission lines\n(e.g., Brittain et al. 2023). The observation of ro-\nvibrational CO emission has been used extensively to\nstudy warm molecular gas in the inner disk (e.g., Na-\njita et al. 2000). While such emission is generally not\nspatially resolved, the radial distribution of the emitting\ngas can be inferred from the resolved spectral line profiles\n(Brittain et al. 2003; Najita et al. 2007a; Blake & Boogert\n2004; Salyk et al. 2011).

The integrand is constructed to be compat-\nible with dimensional regularization and supersymmetry by employing two strategies\n(implicitly defining our regularization scheme): supersymmetric decomposition and\nmatching to massive spinor-helicity amplitudes. All internal vector components in-\nherit their D-dimensional properties by relating them to the previously constructed\nD≤6,N= 2 SQCD amplitude using supersymmetric decomposition identities of\nindividual diagrams. This leaves only diagrams with internal matter lines as un-\nknown masters, which are in turn constrained on D-dimensional unitarity cuts by\nreinterpreting the extra-dimensional momentum components as masses for the chi-\nral supermultiplets. We rely on the massive spinor-helicity formalism and massive\non-shell N= 1 superspace, generalized here to complex masses. Finally, we extend\nthe kinematic numerator algebra to include three-term identities that are dual to\ncolor identities linear in the matter Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, as well as two new\noptional identities satisfied by mass-deformed N= 4 and N= 2 SYM theories that\npreserve N= 1 supersymmetry.

The connection between these theories can be made more\nexplicit: decomposing the N= 4 supermultiplet, and allowing for representation\nchange and mass deformation, one naturally encounters the field content of QCD.\nPackaging the leftover component fields into lower-supersymmetric multiplets allows\nQCD amplitudes to be decomposed into individually simpler parts with, and with-\nout, supersymmety. The process of recycling all higher-supersymmetric information\nin this way when computing an amplitude is referred to as supersymmetric decom-\nposition and has been applied for QCD — in particular at tree level [1–3] and for\none loop amplitudes [4–6].\nWith this decomposition in mind, rather than going straight from the maximally\nsupersymmetric toy model to phenomenologically-relevant QCD, it is interesting to\nhave access to results from N= 1 and N= "}
