In [19] there is an approach to the investigation of the pseud o-\ncontinuability of Schur functions in terms of Schur paramet ers.

The main object in the approach is based on co nsidering\na Schur function as characteristic function of a contractio n (see Sec-\ntion 1.2). This enables us outgoing from Schur parameters to construct\na model of the corresponding contraction (see Section 2). In this model,\nthe relative position of the largest shift and the largest co shift in a com-\npletely nonunitary contraction is described in Section 3 an d then, based\non this model, to ﬁnd characteristics which are responsible for the pseu-\ndocontinuability of Schur functions (see Sections 4 and 5).

In 1974, Kaplinskaja classiﬁed all simplicial straight hyp erbolic\nCoxeter prisms. In this paper, we determine precisely which of these prisms\nare properly quasi-arithmetic or arithmetic. We also prese nt some observations\nregarding commensurability classes and systoles of the ass ociated orbifolds.\nFinally, we show that there is a cocompact properly quasi-ar ithmetic reﬂection\ngroup in H3preserving an isotropic quadratic form. This phenomenon wa s\npreviously known due to Vinberg only in dimension 2.\n1.Introduction\nThis paper concerns arithmetic properties of hyperbolic Coxeter prisms , that\nis, ﬁnite-volume hyperbolic Coxeter polyhedra combinatorially equiva lent to the\nproduct of a simplex and a segment. Recall that hyperbolic Coxeter polyhedra, i.e.\nconvex polyhedra with dihedral angles of the form π/m, are canonical fundamental\ndomains for discrete groups generated by reﬂections in hyperplan es of hyperbolic\n(or Lobachevsky) spaces Hn.\nAny prism has precisely two simplicial facets, its bases. In contrast to the Eu-\nclidean setting, a hyperbolic Coxeter prism can have at most one bas e orthogonal\nto all adjacent facets. In the presence of such a base, which is ne cessarily compact,\nthe prism is said to be straight. Any hyperbolic Coxeter prism can be cut into two\nstraight prisms sharing a common such base; in particular, since com pact Coxeter\nsimplices do not exist in H≥5, ﬁnite-volume hyperbolic Coxeter prisms cease to\nexist in dimensions ≥6.\nCompact and ﬁnite-volume straight hyperbolic Coxeter prisms were classiﬁed by\nKaplinskaja[ 18]in1974;seeTable 1. InH3, theseprismsprovidenotjust aninﬁnite\nfamily of Coxeter polyhedra, but even inﬁnitely many commensurability classes of\nﬁnite-covolume reﬂection groups. On the other hand, in H4andH5there are only\nﬁnitely many such prisms. Our goal is to precisely determine which hyp erbolic\nreﬂection groups associated to straight Coxeter prisms are (quasi-)arithmetic .\nA hyperbolic lattice Γ <Isom(Hn) =Gis said to be quasi-arithmetic if there is\na totally real number ﬁeld k⊂Rand ak-groupGsuch that G(R) is isogenous to\nGwith Γ virtually contained in G(k) via this isogeny, but Gσ(R) is compact for\nevery non-identity embedding σ:k→R. In this case, the adjoint trace ﬁeld of Γ\ncoincides with k, and Γ is arithmetic if and only if it is commensurable to G(Ok)\nwhereOkis the ring of integers of the ﬁeld k. The latter condition is equivalent to\ntr(Adγ)∈ Okfor eachγ∈Γ where Ad denotes the adjoint representationofthe Lie\ngroupG. We saythat alattice Γ is properly quasi-arithmetic if it is quasi-arithmetic\nbut not arithmetic. We will conﬂate reﬂection groups, their fundam ental Coxeter\npolyhedra and associated reﬂective orbifolds (i.e. quotients of Hnby reﬂection\ngroups) when speaking about their arithmetic or group-theoretic properties.\n12 NIKOLAY BOGACHEV AND KHUSRAV YOROV\nThe notion of quasi-arithmeticity was ﬁrst suggested by Vinberg in 1 967 in his\nfundamental work [ 28] on hyperbolic reﬂection groups where, applying his original\ntechniques, he provided several properly quasi-arithmetic reﬂec tion groups in Hn\nforn= 3,4,5. We would like to stress that some hyperbolic Coxeter prisms were\namong those examples. Moreover, even earlier, in 1966, Makarov [ 20] provided the\nﬁrst examples of nonarithmetic lattices in Isom( H3) via ﬁnite-volume noncompact\nCoxeter prisms. This remarkable work of Makarov motivated furth er study (initi-\nated by Vinberg) of hyperbolic reﬂection groups and their arithmet ic properties.\nIt is well known that there are many nonarithmetic hyperbolic lattice s, includ-\ning some constructions that apply in all dimensions n/greaterorequalslant2. The ﬁrst is due to\nGromov and Piatetski–Shapiro [ 17] (see also Raimbault [ 25] and Gelander–Levit\n[16]), who constructed nonarithmetic hyperbolic hybridsby gluing pairwise incom-\nmensurable arithmetic blocks. Later, Thomson [ 27] observed that such hybrids are\nnot quasi-arithmetic. Other nonarithmetic lattices were construc ted by Agol [ 1],\nBelolipetsky–Thomson[ 4], andBergeron–Haglund–Wise[ 5](seealsoMila[ 22]), giv-\ning rise to ﬁnite-volume hyperbolic manifolds with arbitrarily small systole. This\nconstruction produces properly quasi-arithmetic hyperbolic lattic es as was also\nshown by Thomson [ 27], allowing him to distinguish these two classes of nonar-\nithmetic lattices even up to commensurability. It is also worth mention ing that\nDouba [13] recently provided another family of hyperbolic manifolds with small\nsystoles which are not quasi-arithmetic and thus are not commensu rable to those\nconstructed by Agol, Belolipetsky–Thomson, and Bergeron–Haglu nd–Wise,but are\ncreated by taking hybrids of the manifolds constructed by the latt er authors.\nTo conclude the discussion of quasi-arithmetic hyperbolic lattices in a general\nsetting, we mention the following two results.

It is challenging to identify appropri-\nate constraint specifications due to the unde-\nfined trade-off between the reward maximiza-\ntion objective and the constraint satisfaction,\nwhich is ubiquitous in constrained decision-\nmaking. To tackle this issue, we propose a\nnew constrained RL approach that searches\nfor policy and constraint specifications to-\ngether. This method features the adaptation\nof relaxing the constraint according to a re-\nlaxation cost introduced in the learning objec-\ntive. Since this feature mimics how ecological\nsystems adapt to disruptions by altering op-\neration, our approach is termed as resilient\nconstrained RL. Specifically, we provide a set\nof sufficient conditions that balance the con-\nstraint satisfaction and the reward maximiza-\ntion in notion of resilient equilibrium, propose\na tractable formulation of resilient constrained\npolicy optimization that takes this equilib-\nrium as an optimal solution, and advocate two\nresilient constrained policy search algorithms\nwith non-asymptotic convergence guarantees\non the optimality gap and constraint satis-\nfaction. Furthermore, we demonstrate the\nmerits and the effectiveness of our approach\nin computational experiments.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nConstrained reinforcement learning (RL) is a con-\nstrained control problem in which an agent aims to\nPreliminary work.maximize its expected cumulative reward while satisfy-\ning a given constraint by interacting with an environ-\nment over time. Multiple requirements are of growing\ninterest in constrained RL towards designing an agent\nto meet more than one constraint, e.g., resource allo-\ncation for many users [ De Nijs et al., 2021 ] and safe\nlearning in robotics [ Brunke et al., 2022 ]. Real-world\nconstrained RL often engages practical problems with\nunwell-specified requirements, e.g., human-satisfaction\nin human-robot interaction [ El-Shamouty et al., 2020 ]\nand safety level of robotic agents [ Zhang et al., 2020 ].\nHence, it is challenging to determine reasonable con-\nstraint specifications for making trade-off between re-\nward maximization and constraint satisfaction.\nAlthough reward shaping has been widely used to ag-\ngregate multiple requirements into a single reward,\ne.g., [ P´ erez-D’Arpino et al., 2021 ], it doesn’t guarantee\nconstraint satisfaction for each requirement. A known\nreason for this single-reward failure is that the solutions\ngenerated by standard RL algorithms do not necessarily\nsatisfy required constraints, which is known as “scalar-\nization fallacy” [ Szepesv´ ari, 2020 ,Zahavy et al., 2021 ,\nCalvo-Fullana et al., 2023 ]. Therefore, it is cru-\ncial to directly impose the constraints that re-\nsult from multiple requirements [ Roy et al., 2022 ],\nwhich has been studied by a lot of recent ef-\nforts, e.g., [ Chow et al., 2017 ,Paternain et al., 2019 ,\nDing et al., 2020 ]. However, such results are based\non known feasible constraints, not applicable in the\nsituations with unknown constraint specifications.\nTo fill this gap, we aim to automate the constraint\nspecifications during constrained RL training by fa-\ncilitating the trade-off between reward maximization\nand constraint satisfaction. The focal RL environ-\nment of this paper is the constrained Markov decision\nprocess (MDP) that constrains expected cumulative\nutilities [ Altman, 1999 ], which has been widely-used in\nmany constraint-rich domains, e.g., resource allocation,\nrobotic planning, and financial management; see more\nin [Garcıa and Fern´ andez, 2015 ,De Nijs et al., 2021 ,\nGu et al., 2022, Brunke et al., 2022].arXiv:2312.17194v1  [math.OC]  28 Dec 2023Resilient Constrained Reinforcement Learning\nContribution. Our contributions are threefold.\n•We first introduce nominal constraints that are\npossibly infeasible, so that they can be relaxed to\ncompromise reward maximization for constraint\nsatisfaction. We provide the sensitivity analysis\nof the optimal reward value function to the per-\nturbations in constraints. Since the compromise\nmimics how ecological systems adapt to disrup-\ntions by changing operating conditions, we term\nthis as resilient constrained policy optimization,\nand broadly as resilient constrained RL.\n•To specify the levels or thresholds of constraints,\nwe introduce a user-defined cost function that es-\ntablishes a price for relaxing nominal constraints,\nand exploit the relative difficulty of relaxing dif-\nferent constraints to define a trade-off solution:\nresilient equilibrium. We provide a tractable for-\nmulation of resilient constrained policy optimiza-\ntion that takes this equilibrium as an optimal\nsolution, and establish its duality theory under\nless restrictive feasibility assumption.\n•To find"}

(3)\nIn particular, one has νκ→0 asκ→ ∞.\nEmail address: frederic.ouimet2@mcgill.ca (Fr´ ed´ eric Ouimet)\n1The main goal of the present paper (Theorem 1) is to establish a local asymptotic expansion,\nasκ→ ∞, for the log-ratio of the von Mises density ( 1) to the (linear) Normal( µ,2ν2\nκ) density,\nviz.,\n1√\n2νκφ/parenleftbiggδx√\n2/parenrightbigg\n,whereφ(z):=exp(−z2/2)√\n2πandδx:=x−µ/radicalbig\n1−I1(κ)/I0(κ).(4)\nNotice the extra scaling factor√\n2 for the (linear) standard deviation in ( 4). This factor would\nnot appear if the expected limiting distribution was the usual Normal (µ,ν2\nκ) distribution.\nTo explain the extra scaling factor, consider a wrapped normal dist ribution with mean direc-\ntionµ∈[0,2π) and scaling parameter σ∈(0,∞), henceforth denoted by WNormal( µ,σ2). Its\ndensity function is given by the inﬁnite sum\ngµ,v2(θ) =∞/summationdisplay\nk=−∞1\nσ√\n2πexp/braceleftbigg\n−1\n2σ2(θ−µ+2πk)2/bracerightbigg\n, θ∈[0,2π), (5)\nsee, e.g., p. 50-51 of Mardia & Jupp (2000) or Section 2.2.6 of Jammalamadaka & SenGupta\n(2001); it has the same support as the von Mises distribution. The WNorma l(µ,σ2) distribution\ncan be visualized as a Normal( µ,σ2) distribution “folded” onto the unit circle. When the scaling\nparameter σof the underlying normal distribution is small, most of the distribution ’s mass will be\nlocated near the mean direction µ, minimizing the “wrapping” eﬀect. Indeed, the expression ( 5)\nessentially sums the normal densities from each “wrap” around the circle. For a small σ, the\nmajority of the distribution’s weight is around the mean direction µ, and the contributions from\nterms with k/ne}ationslash= 0 (i.e., terms from subsequent wraps around the circle) will be minima l. It is well\nknown to be a limiting distribution of the von Mises( µ,κ) distribution when the concentration\nparameter κtends to inﬁnity, see Kent(1978) or Eq. (3.5.24) of Mardia & Jupp (2000) for details.\nThe circular expectation and variance of Θ ∼WNormal( µ,σ2) are\nCE(Θ)≡arg{E(eiΘ)}=µandCVar(Θ)≡1−E{cos(Θ−µ)}= 1−exp(−σ2/2).\nThe circular variance provides a measure of the dispersion of the dis tribution on the circle and\nis derived using the so-called mean resultant length, see, e.g., Sectio n 2.3.1 of Mardia & Jupp\n(2000). For small σ, the mean resultant length is close to 1. Speciﬁcally, when σ2is small, one\nhas the ﬁrst-order Taylor approximation\nCVar(Θ) = 1−exp(−σ2/2)≈σ2\n2=/parenleftbiggσ√\n2/parenrightbigg2\n,\nwhere the aforementioned extra scaling factor√\n2 appears again. The asymptotic relationship\nbetweenthecircularvarianceofthevonMisesdistributionandthec orrespondinglimitingwrapped\nnormal distributions is therefore\nνκ=σ√\n2,or equivalently, σ=√\n2νκ.\nThis explains the extra scaling factor√\n2 in (4); it serves as a pivotal scaling relationship between\nthe unit circle and the real line. In essence, it accounts for the add itional variance caused by the\nsubsequent wraps ( k/ne}ationslash= 0) around the unit circle. This connectio"}

Introduction\nSnell’s law of refraction [7, Chapter 1] describes the trajectory of a ray when passing\nfrom one medium to another. The interface separating both media creates a discontinuity\nin the refractive index causing a change in the direction of the propagating radiation. Due\nto recent technological advances, metasurfaces were introduced in optical designs. These\nare ultra-thin artificially engineered materials composed of nano-structures that introduce\nabrupt phase shifts along the optical path to bend light in non-standard ways [1]. The\ncorresponding generalized Snell’s law was derived and verified in multiple papers in\noptical engineering for example [41] and [42] in two dimensions. The three-dimensional\ncorresponding law is proved in [21] using the Fermat principle and in [22] from the\ndistributional Maxwell system.\nIn this paper, we study two inverse problems in Geometric Optics involving hybrid\nlenses composed of a standard refracting surface and a flat metasurface. We first study\nthe existence of such a lens refracting a variable incident field of directions emitted from a\nplanar source into a predefined constant direction, see Figure 1. We assume that the face\ncloser to the source is a given conventional refracting surface and that the other face of the\nlens is the flat metasurface. The goal is to analyze the existence of a phase discontinuity\nin a neighborhood of every point on the metasurface so that all rays leave the lens along\na given constant direction. To do this, we use the standard and the generalized Snell’s\nlaws to reduce the problem into a system of partial di fferential equations and show that\nthe incident field must satisfy a curl condition (3.2.1). Assuming (3.2.1), we employ the\nimplicit function theorem and the notion of envelop to find a su fficient condition on the\nlower face of the lens and the incident field so that the required phase discontinuity exists.\nThe considered model in this part is a non-imaging far-field inverse problem where we\nare not interested in creating an image but rather in the direction of the rays leaving the\nlens.\nUsing the far-field analysis, we next consider the following imaging problem in the\nnear-field case. Given a bijective map Tbetween a planar source and a planar target,\nour goal is to find a hybrid lens that achieves T. In other words, every point in the\nsource emits a ray that is refracted by the lens into its corresponding image defined by\nT. The rays entering and leaving the lens are assumed vertical see Figure 2. In this\nmodel, we show that the lower face of the lens satisfies a system of semilinear partial\ndifferential equations (4.2.2) and find in Theorem 4.2 conditions on Tso that a solution\nexists. Once the lower face is found, the existence of the phase discontinuity will be\ndeduced from the far-field analysis requiring additional conditions on the map T, see\nTheorem 4.7. We apply this analysis in Section 4.4 to several examples in particular when\nTis a magnification /contraction, and when |T−I|is constant.x\nWe put our results in perspective both from the mathematical and optical points of\nview.

This\npropertydatesbacktoPoincaré[Poi99],whoaskedifthedynamicalsystemsthatariseincelestial\nmechanics satisfy a closing property. In modern dynamics, this problem was revisited by\nPeixoto [Pei88], Pugh [Pug67a,Pug67b] and Pugh-Robinson [PR83], who proved the 𝐶1-closing\nproperty for smooth systems, Hamiltonian systems and in several other settings.\nFigure 1. The closing property states that nearly closed orbits can be closed by\nsome small perturbation, akin to the introduction of a planet with small mass.\nThese landmark results were followed by a relative lull, as examples due to Pugh [Pug75],\nHernandez[Her79],Robinson[Gut87]andHerman[Her91a,Her91b]showedthat 𝐶2andhigher\nclosing properties do not hold at the level of generality of the 𝐶1version. Despite this, Smale\nincluded the 𝐶8-closing property as the 10th problem in his influential problem list [Sma98].\nOverthelastdecade,thesituationchangeddramaticallyduetoworkofIrie[Iri15],whoused\nFloer theory to prove a strong version of the 𝐶8closing property for Reeb flows on closed\ncontact 3-manifolds. This breakthrough spurred a flurry of recent activity at the intersection\nof dynamics and symplectic geometry, resulting in a smooth closing property for Hamiltonian\nsurface maps [AI16] and area preserving surface maps [CGPZ21,EH21], along with several\nequidistribution results [Iri18,Pra21].\nThe main tools in the works following Irie are spectral invariants coming from embedded\ncontact homology (ECH) [Hut10] and its relatives, which can only be used in low dimensions.\nIn[CDPT22],thepresentauthors,DattaandPrasadtookthefirststepsinapplyingFloertheoretic\nmethods to the study of higher dimensional closing properties, and in particular addressed a\nconjecture of Irie [Iri22]. However, the methods of [CDPT22] have many limitations related to\nthedifficultyofdefiningandcomputingcontacthomology[Par15,Par16a].

I NTRODUCTION\nMany interesting varieties can be constructed as GIT quotients of vector spaces V/ /G : important\nexamples include toric varieties, Grassmannians, and flag varieties. When G=Tis a torus, the\nquotient is a toric variety, for which many questions are highly computable. For a general group G,\nand GIT quotient V/ /G , one can replace Gwith a maximal torus T. The associated toric variety\nV/ /T is sometimes called the Abelianization of V/ /G.\nUnderstanding the connection between V/ /G andV/ /T can allow one to extend the combinato-\nrial control of toric varieties to other, more general, varieties. This strategy, which can be called\ntheAbelian/non-Abelian correspondence has been applied successfully in many different contexts:\ncohomology [10,18], IandJfunctions [3,15,22], and quantum cohomology [14]. The inspiration\nfor this paper was to ask whether this strategy could give insight in understanding the Cox ring\nofV/ /G. The Cox ring of a variety X, informally defined, is the algebra generated by all global\nsections of all line bundles of X.\nExamples of Cox rings include such well-studied objects as the Pl ¨ucker coordinate ring of the\nGrassmannian and the homogeneous coordinate ring of a toric variety. Finding generators of the\nCox ring – or even just generators of sub-algebras of the Cox ring – gives information about the\nvariety; for example, through understanding maps into projective space. One important application\nis that a SAGBI basis of the Cox ring induces a toric degeneration of the variety. Toric degenera-\ntions extend the combinatorial control of toric varieties to other varieties and also have important\napplications in mirror symmetry.\nIn this paper, we study the Cox ring of quiver moduli spaces via quiver semi-invariants and the\nAbelian/non-Abelian correspondence. Our main results are:\n•We introduce pairs of linked tableaux as a combinatorial structure indexing Domokos–\nZubkov [9] generators of the Cox ring.

For instance, where previously Dvořák et al. pr oved that planar graphs of girth 6are\n(weighted) ǫ-ﬂexibly 3-choosable for an extremely small value of ǫ, we obtain the optimal value\nǫ“1\n3. Finally, we completely determine and show interesting beh avior on the packing numbers\nforH-minor-free graphs for some small graphs H.\n1 Introduction\nGiven a list-assignment L:VpGq Ñ2Nto a graph G, a (proper) L-coloring is a proper coloring of G\nsuch that every vertex vreceives a color from its list Lpvq. The list-chromatic number (orchoosability )\nχℓpGqof a graph is the minimum integer ksuch that every list-assignment Lwith lists of size at least\nkadmits an L-coloring. One of the most salient appearances of this param eter is in Thomassen’s\nfamous proof of the 5-choosability of planar graphs [39]. Indeed, while every pl anar graph is 4-\ncolorable [3, 38], and every planar triangle-free graph is 3-colorable [23], this is no longer true in\nthe list-coloring setting.

Email: xdzhu@zjnu.edu.cn .\n1A common generalisation of these three statements was recen tly obtained by Postle and Smith-\nRoberge [36]. Other suﬃcient conditions for 3-choosability of planar graphs were proven in e.g. [20,\n24, 16] and citing papers therein. As it turns out, beyond the guaranteed existence of some proper\nL-coloring, one can actually prove that there are exponentia lly many for the mentioned graph classes.\nTheorem 1.2. A planar graph Ghas exponentially many L-colorings if\n•Lis a5-list-assignment ([41]),\n•Lis a4-list-assignment and Gis triangle-free ([28]),\n•Lis a3-list-assignment and Ghas girth at least 5([42]).\nThat is, there is a constant cą1such that every graph Gof ordernadmits at least cnproper colorings\nin the above situations.\nIt is well-known that for every graph G, every list-assignment Lwith all lists of size ěχℓpGq `1\nadmits exponentially many L-colorings. This can be seen by double-counting the pairs of a sublist-\nassignment L0of sizeχℓpGqand anL0-coloring. Thus the strength of Theorem 1.2 lies in having\nthe list sizes one smaller than trivial. Our goal in this pape r is to admit slightly larger list sizes (if\nnecessary) in return for a much more structured (not always s tronger1) property: having multiple\ndisjointL-colorings. For example, any 3-list-assignment Lof a planar graph Gwith girth at least 8\nadmits two disjoint proper L-colorings, as we will see in Theorem 4.6.\nHaving the maximum number of possible disjoint L-colorings is captured by the notion of list-\npacking . In particular, we study the list packing number χ‹\nℓpGqof planar graphs Gunder various\ngirth constraints. The list packing number is a graph invari ant that has recently been introduced\nin [11] as a fertile middle ground between the classic notion s of list-coloring and strong coloring, and\nhas since been further explored in [10, 13, 33, 27].
