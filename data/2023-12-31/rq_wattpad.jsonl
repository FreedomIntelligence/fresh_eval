You looked around until you gained enough consciousness to notice that you weren't in the grassy fields next to the river, instead, you were in some kind of small hut made of leaves and branches. You saw the doorway made of two large leaves, covering the sunlight. You were scared. What kind of person would kidnap someone and leave them in a room? Were you being watched? Imprisoned? Enslaved? You needed to get out of there, and quickly.You slowly started to get out of the bed, trying not to make noise. While standing up, you hold on to a small table beside the bed for support but accidentally knock over a glass flask. In panic, you look around your surroundings for anything you can use to at least defend yourself. Your eyes quickly lay on a beautiful leaf-like bow on top of the same table. You quickly grab it and start to aim at the door.Your heart was beating quickly, your hands were shaking, and your breathing was uneven. Anything could happen to you now.As you waited for the leaves to reveal your kidnapper, you tried to listen for anything. It could be that no one heard the breaking of the flask. It could also be that no one is around the area.These thoughts quickly disappeared when you started to hear voices that seemed to be coming closer to the hut. You couldn't make out words due to your anxiety. You gripped the bow even tighter. You weren't a great aimer under pressure, but this situation could turn into life or death. You stretched the arrow farther, pointing at the center of the door.When the leaves started to part, you froze. Your hands were stuck in place, and your mouth couldn't move. You stopped breathing and your heart stopped beating. The leaves parted. It revealed a young man with long, large black ears, chin-length black hair, and forest-green eyes. He wasn't the one who kidnaps you, but you couldn't completely take him off your radar.When the man looked at you, his relaxed eyes turned shocked.\"Come down now, no need to get aggressive,\" he tried to comfort you, but you didn't budge.He slowly took a step forward, but you straightened your grip.\"I knew I shouldn't have left it there,\" you heard him mutter.He stretched his hands, to be sure that you didn't strike him to his death. He was like a manipulator. His eyes were controlling you, telling you to put the bow down. You shook your head. You just couldn't be sure if he was trying to deceive you or trying to help you.\"How do I know you're not going to hurt me?\" you asked, not being completely sure why.He looked at you, then behind you, \"You see that notebook on the table, that's what I used to keep track of your well-being, and it also includes a few other people that have been found in the same situation as you.\"You looked straight into his eyes and straightened your grip. You wouldn't easily fall for this leveled trick, but your curiosity was getting the better of you. You shifted your eyes to the table, and you noticed an open notebook, containing writing. You started to look at your surroundings, and you noticed he wasn't lying. There is a small stack of books on the shelf, including jars, herbs, and towels. There was also a hanging frame with plants and butterflies beside the shelf.You slowly lowered the bow, making sure that he didn't move to attack you. Once you completely lowered the bow, you heard him sigh in relief.He walked towards, it with a little caution. When he was in front of you, he stretched his hand out, telling you to give the bow to him. With a bit of hesitation, you gave it to him. He put the bow on his back and adjusted it.He looked at you, smiling, \"I would like to compliment you on your caution and attention, but you could work on your bow position.\" he stretched out his hand, \"I'm Tighnari, Forest Watcher of the Avidya Forest.\"You shook his hand, \"I'm Y/N, a new student in the Akademiya.\"He looked at you in shock, \"A new student? What are they trying to do?\" he murmured.\"What do you mean?\" you asked.\"Nothing you should worry about\"Tighnari walked over to the table, got the notebook, and wrote something on it. You tried to see what he was writing, but you couldn't understand it like it was a different language.After writing his notes, he closed the notebook and looked back at you, \"You are really lucky that you woke up after three days, many don't even see the light of day again.\"You look at him, confused, \"What do you mean by \"three days\"? What is going on?\"—————————————————————————-Word Count: 830A/N: I apologize for not uploading a chapter for a week. I had to visit family during Christmas, and two days ago, my parents got me a new phone, so I'm still trying to figure out this thing out. But don't worry, I'm not abandoning this project so easily, I'm having fun with it. Also, thank you for the 80 views!!! It means a lot!"}

Whether they'd be in love with someone else or have a crush, it's relatively easy. The way they'd out a fake glare, but their eyes are soft, and their heart is definitely beating in sync with the other. I think I may have figured a few things out about my friends back in France, whether they dated or not, I've realized that most of the time, when two people are in love, they deny it, until they cave, and question themselves which pushes them away from the other. They become so concerned about these feelings, so tight, and so closed off that no one can get to them. Until they decide they should let go, and then that's where they finally come forward.Maybe I'd be a good major in psychology.Despite all that, my own feelings are complicated. Their all complicated, and it's difficult to figure out emotions yourself rather than figure out the other emotions. Being a people reader doesn't necessarily help your own situation, and frankly, that's okay. But for me? It's not. I like to be reassured that while I take risks and chances, being assured in the emotional department is something I value. But with Kabuki? Where is the reassurance? We were both on a plank in the middle of the ocean, tethering. We didn't have solid ground, and sure, as hell had no affection towards each other, so why was there a pull? Where did it come from? And how will I deal with this? \"You're thinking too much.\" My sister had said yesterday morning in our face time. She rolled her eyes exceptionally elegant and  proceeded to tell me many things I preferred. I didn't need to know about myself.\"If we think too much, then what's the point in thinking at all?\" I snapped. Where did that come from?\"Ugh, I mean that you're thinking too much about this. Feelings will work itself out. For now, you just have to go with the flow.\" I scoffed at her, \"Go with the flow? What is this? A swimming contest?\" \"Shut up. Maybe you're thinking about this too much and thinking less about what Sulli will think.\" Sulli! I completely forgot! Not that it mattered, did it? \"When I get to that, I'll start to worry.\" \"Nat—\" I had hung up on her. ***\"Morning.\" Said Narami, bowing slightly with a smile. Narami was an awfully pretty female, I wondered how many male coaches have approached her. I smiled, \"Kabuki?\" I asked, I hadn't seen him this morning. He had slept at my place as we went over a recorded tape of his short program. For some reason, he kept having trouble with it. It was one day to the short program, or should I say none, considering tomorrow was the short program? Well, tomorrow was the short program, the Cup of China, a considerably dangerous area of skating, considering that they add skaters just to take them back out. Most of the skaters are from different division, and most of them are beyond amazing that they add. You stick with a few of the ones you went against with in France, but you also face against an entirely new number of figure skaters. \"He's on the ice right now.\" I nod and continue walking towards the rink we usually use. When my footsteps echo, I slow them down and watch as he skates, no music, and by the jumps and step sequences he's doing, it's a go over of his short program.I hadn't noticed this before, maybe because I didn't want to, and I didn't exactly fancy him. But he's hard working, and the little gloss over his eyes breaks my heart whenever he can't get something right. The way he moves on the ice is elegant, and the determination to succeed is intimidating. I wonder, does he hold that determination for everything else? Would he hold that determination to have me? Can I hold determination like that to have him? He spots me and stops skating, comes to a halt, and them starts to come towards the boards. A smile plasters his face rather than the glare he holds. It's a soft smile, almost non-existent, but it's there. \"You're finally here?\" He asks, opens the plastic water bottle settled on the boards and drinks from it. \"I slept in, you left me.\" He shrugs. \"I need a routine.\" And continues to drink the water, his adam apple bobs up and down as he takes gulps and his eyes water slightly. I tilt my head, \"You seem tired. How long have you been here?\" He doesn't answer and pretends to check out the plastic bottle. \"Cheating on sleep? That's not smart.\" He rolls his eyes, \"Didn't know I was supposed to be intellectual.\" \"What was your score in high school?\" \"Five.\" I squint my eyes, \"Five? What?\" \"We used a numerical thing. Five is the highest. \" \"Ahhhh... okay.\" I say and nod. He set the empty bottle down. \"I'd like to have breakfast.\" I tilt my head, \"Weren't you supposedly on a diet?\" I say because he's been proclaiming every single time I try to feed him real food and not rabbit food. \"I was, now, I want to eat. A bit of something out of my diet chart won't kill me, Avon.\" I laugh at him. \"You say that but then proceed to kill me when I offer we eat something like fries.\" \"Fries has oil,\"\"Almost every other breakfast has a bit of oil in it.\" \"Yes, but fries is deep fried.\"I scoff and laugh, \"Okay, fine. We'll go eat food outside your diet.\"\"Breakfast.\" He says, and he starts to take off his skates. \"Breakfast.\" I repeat, watch as he walks barefoot to the bench and puts on his shoes, throws atop of his practice suit a long jeans from his duffel and done. I squint. \"Is that what you do when you don't want to change? You just put on the most baggy jeans in the world and continue to use the tightest long sleeves ever?\" He gives me a passing smirk, \"Yes, we are just going to get food, not walk a red carpet.\" He says and puts on a gray jacket. I roll my eyes and follow behind as he walks out, my mind flicks to our conversation. We barely had any conversations like this before he decided to jump out of a moving car I rented. Then my mind flicks to the first part of my name, and the voice with a sort of heavy accent keeps saying it. Then I realize that instead of saying Mr.Luve or sir like he did, he's calling me Avon. My heart flutters and falls deep. Improvements.

The sound was hypnotic, a melody that seemed to escape from his soul. However, this moment of introspection was abruptly interrupted by Leah's authoritative voice.Leah, with her confident demeanor and piercing gaze, watched Tyler with a mix of surprise. The guitar in question was a family heirloom, but Leah never expected her younger brother to have such skill with the instrument.Leah: What do you think you're doing, kid?Tyler, clearly caught off guard, responded with a mix of defense and curiosity: Tyler: I'm just... playing?Leah, with a stern expression, approached him:Leah: That guitar is mine. How dare you?Tyler, still holding the Les Paul, replied defiantly: Tyler: I figured. But you never say it you have one.Leah's eyes narrowed, realizing Tyler's emerging musical potential. She had underestimated her brother. After a pause, she suggested: Leah: Look, I'm heading to the YorkDolls club later. If you help me clean up this mess now, maybe I'll take you with me.Tyler's curiosity was piqued. Leah rarely included him in her plans, especially considering the illicit activities she often engaged in. He knew about her gambling, her love for alcohol, and her passion for causing mayhem. The idea of going to the club with her, however, was tempting.Tyler: What exactly is YorkDolls?Leah, giving a sly smile, repliedLeah: I'll tell you later. But first, help me clean this mess.Tyler: If you say So...Leah: Ah...C'mon, I Will tell you later!Leah Norris, Tyler's older sister, was in her mid-20s. Standing at an impressive height of 1.85m, she stood out wherever she went. While her hair shared the same blonde hue as Tyler's, it was notably coarser.She had a curious nature, often questioning the world around her and seeking to understand life's nuances. In serious situations, Leah appeared introspective and deep, with a piercing gaze that seemed to read people's souls. However, in her free time, she had a darker and more rebellious side.The shadowy corners of the city often saw Leah engaging in questionable activities. Her fondness for gambling was well-known, and she had an almost supernatural ability to navigate card tables and roulette wheels. Alongside alcohol, which often helped her escape life's realities, Leah also had an intimate relationship with cigarettes, the smoke from which frequently surrounded her in dimly lit, smoky environments.Tyler, on the other hand, had a complex relationship with Leah's choices. He \"detested\" her activities, not only due to his principles but also out of concern for her well-being. The age difference between the two, coupled with their contrasting personalities, often led to conflicts, but also moments of deep understanding and connection.Backwards to Year 1975Tyler and his mother, Cecilia, quietly climbed into the street, escaping from their old house. Once they arrived at Carter's house, Tyler turned to his mother with a mix of confusion and concern.Tyler: \"Why are we doing this?\"Cecilia remained silent, clutching her bags tightly. Tyler persisted, trying to make sense of the sudden escape.Tyler: \"Is it because of what I said? We don't have to-\"Cutting him off, Cecilia's voice grew stern and urgent.Cecilia: \"Listen, Tyler. You're going to stay with your older sister. It's the safest place for you right now.\"Tyler, bewildered, tried to grasp the gravity of the situation. Tyler: Why? None of this makes any sense.Cecilia's frustration boiled over as she responded sharply, Cecília: This isn't the time for questionsCecília addingCecilia: Tyler! You need to trust me on this. It's the only way to keep you safe from your father.Tyler:...?Tyler's eyes welled up, struggling to hold back tears as he processed his mother's words. They found refuge in an old motel, intending to stay there for 1 day while waiting for Tyler's older sister to arrive.The neon sign of the \"Goldmine Motel\" flickered intermittently, casting a pale glow on Tyler and Cecilia as they entered their dimly lit room. The worn-out furnishings and musty scent were a far cry from the life they once knew, but for now, it was a sanctuary.As the hours ticked by, Tyler's anxiety grew. Questions swirled in his mind, but he remembered his mother's urgent plea not to question. However, the weight of the unknown pressed heavily on his young shoulders.Late into the night, Tyler questioned whether he would attend school over the next three days.Tyler: \"Do I still have to go to school?\"Cecilia, with a somber expression, replied, \"You have to go, but you'll take a different route. We need to ensure your father doesn't see you.\"The next morning, Tyler donned his school uniform, attempting to push the previous night's events to the back of his mind. However, the weight of the situation made it nearly impossible for him to concentrate on his studies.Upon leaving school, Tyler decided to take a detour, avoiding the church to evade any possible encounters with his father. But as he approached the old motel, a chilling sight stopped him in his tracks-his mother, Cecilia, lying motionless on the ground.Tyler, panic-stricken, rushed to her side. \"Mom? What happened?\"There was no response.Tyler's voice trembled with desperation, \"Mom! Answer me!\"Frantic and filled with dread, Tyler sprinted, searching for anyone who could help. Eventually, he spotted a nearby car wash and, in a desperate bid for assistance, notified the authorities.Within an hour, the piercing sound of sirens filled the air as an ambulance arrived on the scene, rushing Cecilia to the nearest hospital.As the ambulance doors closed with a decisive finality, Tyler's heart raced. He turned to a bystander, pleading, \"Can you give me a ride to the hospital?\"The stranger nodded, a mix of concern and sympathy in his eyes. The drive felt endless, every second stretching into an eternity. When they finally reached the hospital, Tyler's feet felt heavy as he made his way to the waiting area.Minutes felt like hours until a doctor approached him. The somber expression on the doctor's face said it all.\"I'm sorry,\" the doctor began, his voice weighed down by the gravity of his words. \"Your mother passed away from a cerebral hemorrhage.\"The room seemed to spin around Tyler, the weight of his loss pressing down on him. Before he could process the news, authorities began asking questions, trying to piece together the circumstances that led to Cecilia's tragic end.\"Do you have any family or relatives?\" one of the officers inquired.Tears streaming down his face, Tyler shook his head, feeling utterly alone in the world. Tyler:...No (he whispered)Just then, a familiar voice pierced the heavy silence. Leah: Actually, he does have someone Her voice was trembling!Leah announced as she stepped forward, her eyes red-rimmed and filled with grief. Leah: He has me. I'm his sister.As Tyler tried to make sense of the overwhelming news, he noticed Leah's appearance had changed significantly since their last meeting. The pungent smell wafting from her was unfamiliar to him. She was clad in a black coat that reached down to her knees, paired with long black boots that echoed with each step. An old pair of blue pants peeked out from beneath the coat.What caught Tyler's attention the most, however, was Leah's choice of eyewear. She seemed to have a pair of black glasses, but they were conspicuously absent now, especially considering the dimly lit atmosphere of the hospital.Leah's demeanor seemed distant, her eyes reflecting a mix of grief and something Tyler couldn't quite place. As she stepped forward, making her presence known to the authorities, Tyler couldn't shake off the feeling that there when his mother died.A thick silence enveloped the room, heavy with unspoken emotions. After what felt like an eternity, Leah broke the stillness, her voice laced with determination.Leah: Let's get into my car and leave all this mess.Tyler remained silent, lost in his thoughts. Sensing his distress, Leah moved closer and gently began to rub his hair, attempting to offer some semblance of comfort.Leah: Hey!she murmured softly, trying to catch his eye.Leah: You did everything you could, kiddo. There was nothing more that could have been done.Taking a deep breath to steady herself, she continued,Leah: Tomorrow We'll going to the funeral you have to put yourself up atleast now ok!Tyler's gaze met Leah's, a mix of gratitude and uncertainty reflected in his eyes. With a nod, he silently acknowledged her words, knowing deep down that they had to face the challenges ahead, no matter how daunting.Leah leaves the hospital with Tyler...on way from Dakota where she lives, was 10 hours from where they were She questionLeah: What happened at the motel?Taking a deep breath to steady himself, Tyler began recounting the events. Tyler: We got to the motel late last night. Mom was visibly distressed, more than I'd ever seen her. She said she needed a moment alone. Tyler:...Later on, when I went to check on her, I found her unconscious on the floor.\"The weight of the memories pressed on Tyler as he continued, Tyler: I didn't know what to do. I panicked and ran to the nearest place I could find.Tyler: I find a car wash. I just needed someone, anyone, to assist.\"Leah's expression remained stern, prompting Tyler to go on.Tyler: After I got help and returned with The car wash Guy.Tyler concluded, his voice trailing off with a mix of grief and disbelief.A heavy silence settled between them, the gravity of the situation sinking in. Leah reached out, grasping Tyler's hand, offering comfort and solidarity in their shared moment of grief and uncertainty.Leah: We'll get through this...how about sleep a little hmm.....Tyler: alright...Three hours had passed since they left the hospital, and an uncomfortable tension filled the car. Leah's grip on the steering wheel tightened with each passing mile. Eventually, she pulled over to a secluded spot. Checking to see if Tyler was asleep, she glanced through the window. Once she was sure he was preoccupied, she distanced herself from the car.Leah's composure broke. Collapsing to her knees, she let out the pent-up emotions, tears streaming down her face. In one hand, she held a cigarette, its ember glowing brightly in the darkness as she took a drag, attempting to find some semblance of solace in its smoke.Meanwhile, Tyler, restless and unable to sleep, noticed Leah's silhouette in the dim light. He could discern her shoulders shaking, a sign of her silent sobs. The realization that both of them were grappling with their grief in their own ways only deepened the bond between them. Leah:...gasp that fucking old women...ah fuck it With a deep exhale, Leah tossed the cigarette to the ground, crushing it under her boot. Regaining her composure, she restarted the car's engine, the hum of the motor filling the silence between them. The road ahead seemed endless, but Leah was determined.Leah: From now on, Dakota.she muttered to herself, gripping the wheel tightly as they sped away.1976The neon sign of \"Yorkdolls\" glowed brightly, casting a vibrant hue onto the street below. The once-familiar jingle of the store's entrance bell now felt like a rite of passage for Tyler. A year had passed since that fateful night, and life had taken unexpected turns.Inside Yorkdolls, 50s,60s,70s álbuns of rock, metal, jazz and the new stuff around NWOBHM the amplifiers hummed, and guitars gleamed under the soft lighting. Tyler's fingers danced effortlessly over the strings of a Les Paul, its resonant sound echoing through the store. Music had become his refuge, his escape.Leah watched from a distance, a proud smile tugging at her lips. Despite the trials they'd faced, she saw a spark in Tyler's eyes - a passion for music that had blossomed in the face of adversity.Leah: Remember this place?\" Leah asked, approaching Tyler with a smirk.Tyler looked up, pausing his riff. Tyler: How could I forget? This place changed everything.Leah nodded, her eyes drifting to the guitar Tyler held. Leah: Your mother would've been proud,she whispered, more to herself than to him.Tyler's eyes sparkled with excitement as he continued, Tyler: I've made some friends hereLeah responded with a nonchalant toneLeah: Oh, that's cool...though her demeanor suggested she might not be entirely invested in Tyler's newfound friendships.Tyler: They know how to play instruments too!Tyler added eagerly, sensing Leah's slight detachment.Leah's indifference shifted to intrigue. Leah: Is that so? she replied, her interest piqued.Tyler: one of them play drums!!The scene shifted from Yorkdolls to a dimly lit rehearsal space, adorned with musical equipment and vintage posters. In walked the Norton brothers, Eugene and Thomas, their confident strides revealing their familiarity with the place.Eugene, the older of the two, had a rugged charm about him. He approached a drum set, his fingers lightly tapping the snare, producing a rhythmic cadence. Thomas, with a SG 1972 slung over his shoulder, nodded in approval, strumming a few chords in tandem with his brother's beats.Word around is there's a new kid in town making waves,\" Eugene commented, wiping sweat from his brow.Thomas: \"You mean the one Leah's been raving about?\" Thomas smirked.Eugene: \"Maybe it's time we meet this prodigy,\" Eugene chuckled, adjusting a drumstick between his fingers.Thomas laughedThomas: Haha! I bet this kid can't even play 'Smoke on the Water' properly.Eugene's face turned serious, halting Thomas in his tracks. Eugene: Hey, ease up. Their mother passed away just a year ago.\"Thomas shrugged dismissively, Thomas: I don't care. Just because he's had a tough time doesn't mean he can barge in here and act like he owns the place.Eugene: He thinks he's one of us, man.Eugene responded, shaking his head.Thomas: If it weren't for Leah, I wouldn't give that brat a second glance. Eugene took a deep breath, looking over at his brother.Eugene: Well, let's see what he's got tomorrow. Ready to give it another go? 1... 2... 3... 4...\"As the two brothers prepared to continue their jam session, the familiar chords of \"Beat on the Brat\" by the Ramones echoed through the room. The song choice was fitting, given the emerging punk scene and the success of bands like the Ramones in that eraTyler's fingers gently caressed the strings of his guitar, each note resonating with emotion. The room was filled with a melody that seemed to echo his soul's deepest sentiments. Just as he lost himself in the music, Leah sauntered in, an impish grin stretching across her face, a mysterious object concealed behind her back.\"Hehe,\" she giggled mischievously.Raising an eyebrow in curiosity but continuing to play, Tyler asked, \"What's so amusing?\"With a teasing glint in her eyes, Leah responded, \"Oh, nothing at all.\"Suspicion flickered in Tyler's eyes. \"What are you hiding behind your back? Show me.\"Leah smirked, drawing out the suspense. \"I'll reveal it, but first, a little errand for me.\"Tyler rolled his eyes, Tyler: let me a cigarette?Leah shot back sarcastically, Leah: Wow, the school's really sharpened those wits of yours!Tyler: Haha...very funny..Leah laughs Leah: Do not forget the wings when close the front door...little brat!Chuckling at her banter, Tyler headed out to the convenience store to buy her the cigarette, As he walked down the aisles, he couldn't help but notice the televisions showcasing the rising punk movement sweeping England. The raw energy and rebellious spirit of bands like the Ramones were captivating audiences and reshaping the music scene.Returning home with Leah's requested item in hand, Tyler pondered on the growing popularity of punk. While many around him seemed entranced by this new wave, Tyler's heart leaned towards the heavier, more intricate sounds of bands like Thin Lizzy, Black Sabbath, UFO, and Judas Priest. For him, the depth and intensity.Leah beamed, holding up the albums triumphantly. Leah: Tadaaaaaa... I brought you some stuff.Eyeing the vinyl records with a mixture of surprise and curiosity, Tyler responded, Tyler: What is this?Leah feigned shock. Leah: You don't recognize them?Tyler's eyes widened in realization. Tyler: They're punk rock albums.With a hint of defensiveness, Leah asked, Leah: Yeah... you don't like it?Tyler: It's not that Tyler clarified.Tyler: I thought maybe it was a distortion pedal or something.Leah laughed, shaking her head. Leah: I had every intention of getting that distortion pedal, but my wallet disagreed.Tyler continued to examine the records, pondering over the names he saw: Ramones, Misfits, The Clash. Tyler: So, who exactly are these bands?\"With a playful grin, Leah picked up another album from her collection. Holding it up for Tyler to see, she said, Leah: Well, if punk isn't your thing, maybe this will resonate more. She proudly displayed a Judas Priest album, hinting at the heavier sounds that Tyler favored.Tyler's eyes lit up, a smile forming on his lips. Tyler, eyes widening in disbelief, examined the album in his hands once more. Tyler: \"Are you kidding? This is a 'Best of the Year' selection... and it's a recent release?\"Leah nodded, her eyes twinkling with mischief. Leah: \"Yep, fresh off the shelves. I thought about giving it a listen, but seeing how passionate you are about music and how much you've been through lately, I figured it'd be more at home with you.\"She extended the album toward him with a generous smile. Leah: Go ahead, it's all yours.Tyler gives a hug on Leah and she saysLeah: alright...alright enough don't let me regret what I give to you!Tyler's fingers traced the album's cover, a mix of astonishment and gratitude washing over him. The weight of Leah's gesture wasn't lost on him, especially in the midst of the turbulent times they were navigating together.End of chapter 2"}

I knew he would be in his studio and seeing him there, I just wanted him to hold me and never let me go. I hugged him and we stood there for some minutes cherishing the moment before I whispered to him that I didn't want to get married to Luscious, I wanted him. John pulled away and looked into my eyes \"Then don't get married to him\". I smiled and replied \"I can't do that\". John looked pained \"Why?\" He asked.I explained all that is tied to the marriage and he considered it unfair. He told me that though he might be a middle class artist, he would do all it takes to help my family. He told me to run away with him. I wanted to but I knew better than to run away from what I felt was my responsibility. I told him I couldn't. I kissed him goodbye for the last time and turned away. \"Please run away with me, fight for our love\" John begged as he held my hand back.

Full of joy that I'm finally getting my dream of getting a church wedding but here I am. I'm wearing one of the most expensive dress in the world and I felt very unhappy. I thought of what John said yesterday and I removed it from my mind. My mom and sister came in and goshed at how pretty I looked. I didn't feel pretty but I gave a fake smile anyways. My sister handed my a letter from the mail addressed to me. I kept it on the vanity and watched my dad being pushed in by his nurse. My dad came in his wheelchair. He was confined in a wheelchair since his heart disease was severe and he couldn't walk about and do strenuous activities. My dad gave me a smile. It seemed sad, my dad didn't want me to do all these but he didn't have a choice. He couldn't object. He kissed me on my forehead as I bent to hug him. He told me I was pretty and that he only wanted me to be happy. I smiled and thanked them. Finally, they left me alone to finish getting ready. I stood there alone and thoughts begin to bombard my head. \"I just want you to be happy.\" \"Fight for our love.\" \"Run away with me.\" \"I love you.\" My eyes wandered to the letter. I opened it and it read.Dear Anna,If you later ever decide to fight for our love and run away with me. Meet me at the river. We will take a boat to another land where we can stay and get married and come back to take care of your family. I love you a lot and I don't want to lose you.

Honk ]I honked outside of Thomas house, Thomas came running right out of his house. I unlocked the door as he slid into the car.\"Thanks for the ride Claire\" he says.\"No worries Thomas, we're friends\" i smile lights up on my face.I started the car and drove off, we shortly arrived at school. Driving in the parking lot looking for a place to park.\"How about over there...\" Thomas says pointing to the parking spot that was just took.I sighed.It was the car of the popular group of kids. Brady, Chloe, Kendall, Chad, Evan and Rena.Chloe slowly walked around my car examining it.Piece by piece.\"Nice scratches Allen!\" She laughs and receives a high five from everyone in the group and a couple laughs after.I rolled my eyes. \"Don't worry about her Claire\" Thomas says.\"Trust me I won't\" I say resting my hands on the steering wheel.They finally walked away, Thomas pointed to another parking spot which was empty.Good thing.I parked my car over there, Thomas and I walked out of the car. \"Do you have work today?\" He asks as we were waking into the school.\"Thomas you know i have work everyday\" I say.\"Sorry, you're right. Can't she just give you a break just for one day?\" He sighs.\"Never\" \"That completely sucks! Did you see Chloe, her outfit today is so pretty\" he blushes.Thomas was in love with Chloe, but she only used her just past her classes.He was never nothing important to her, as a fact she didn't even know his name. She'd always call him Timmy or Tony when neither of them were his name.\"And she called me timmy\" he says, the tone in his voice made his eyes turn into hearts. \"Thomas, that's not even your name\" I laugh shaking my head. \"It's just a nickname, she'll learn my name eventually\" he says fixing his bookbag.\"Your name isn't even that hard?

I shrugged.\"YOU DONT-\" I quickly put my hand over his mouth before he could be able to finish the sentence.\"Thomas!

I looked over to my locker to see it blocked by a bunch of football players.\"Excuse me\" I say. No answer.They continued their conversation.Brady glances over to me then pecks on one of the guys to move aside. Finally.I opened my locker and took out my notebook and books, and closed it right after.I quickly walked away.Good thing I had english first, I could finally turn in this essay.I walked in class and sat down in the back.

She had a delightful room full of old memories about elementary and high school. Big cups from sports events and some fairy lights that made the atmosphere a bit more cozy. She loved her room and there were times when she did not want to leave it at any cost. Poor thing was not quiet spoiled. Her parents expected the most from her since she was the only artsy girl in her big family of five girls. Everyone were doctors and scientists except from her. She was nobody. An artist who tried to sell her stories and paintings from a small countryside city. The cage of her life was also the cage constructed by her beliefs and upbringing. At a small city like Amberwood with a relatively small income family she was  always out of the finer things in life. Now as she is writing a list at her desk a happy-tear appears on her eyecorner.Something came into her life that turned her mindset upside down. She started to write down her new year's resolutions which will give her guidance when the journey is going to be darker. She did not want to become rich or a socialite. The only thing that moved this girl's heart is the question: how to become a noble soul. How does it look like? Being a modern day quiet luxury aristocrat while not even a penny is attached to your name. It should be possible - she thought.*- Me? As a royalty? - She turned her stunned face to the layer. - Yes, Miss Corvus. I am fully aware of that.- How? Who was the person's name who passed away?- Dorothea Marea Soldati-Corvus. Your great aunt. She passed away being sure about that she has someone who will be reliable with this task  in the bloodline. It was her last wish for someone to step in her footsteps. -I did not even know her! - Maya freaked out.-Mrs. Dorothea Soldati-Corvus ia the secret sister of your grandfather. Your parents insisted that it is you who is the most responsible for bearing this heritage. This last will. I understand that the royalties come with no financial heritage but you may bring out the best of the situation.Maya looked down on her pink-purple sweater and rubber ankleboots. What would these old noble relatives think about her now? Without any discipline or nobleness she was a pile of self-doubt and overthinking. How to turn that around? Is that even possible? She turned to her grandmother, Mary. If someone, she will always know what to do about life changing situations since she had 2 husbands and a life in Socialist Hungary before she ran away for the better living. - You are a Hungarian heiress Maya. Is that so hard to believe? - Of course it is! Look at me! My own parents tried to pass this on me to get rid of anything that is related to our family. Why won't they take the name and the few lands?-They did honey. Before they got married they sold every acres of land to have the money for building your nice home. You are still in the luckiest 15 percent of your generation. I have no idea about the feeling of being a noble. I'm not one. But you will take everything back that communism took from you. Dorothea knew about you and your sisters. She knew that someone can be dedicated to it.-Really? What will this burden ever give for me? - Asked her grandma and she just laughed.-Purpose. And hope for a better future for your children. None of your sisters are as kind hearted as you are Maya. You are all very smart and good at different professions. But it is only you who could blend in as a socialite.The topic of children scared her. Where from will I get even a loose boyfriend in this era of dating? Confusion was visible on her blonde eyelashes and eyebrows. It's not an \"accidentaly royalty\" situation, this is why she started to panic. - I have 2 years left until I get my master's degree.

After ushering for the guards to disperse, he continued marching down the busy streets of Brooklyn. I wish I knew what time it was and I tried to keep alert for a clock somewhere but it was almost impossible to do that and keep up with Damon. I knew if he wanted to, he could have been gone a long time ago but I'm assuming he had to maintain his speed because there were humans around.Foreigners who have no idea how lucky they are. I was one of them not too long ago.I wondered about Luna and what she had meant when she meant I had the Mark of Eros.What the hell is the Mark of Eros? How do I get it off?Damon had gone into a panic when she had said that. If I was such a burden to him, I wondered why he wouldn't just leave me here amongst my people. I could find my own way back home somehow. I needed someone to speak words to me. Someone to sit me down and tell me exactly what it meant that I had the mark and why had it made Luna change her mind about helping me. \"Damon,\" I called out, struggling to keep up,\" slow down!\"He came to a halt in front of a metal door stationed outdoor in between a sketchy-looking corner store and a laundromat.Damon rattled the door and it opened without much resistance. We entered into the doorway to be faced with black stairs leading down to seemingly nowhere.\"What is this,\" I asked Damon struggling to catch my breath,\" where are we?\"Damon spared me a glance for a quick second and mumbled,\" you'll see.\"With that, he began his way down the stairs and I scrambled to follow. At the very bottom was a small hallway and another metal door.Standing guard was a big and muscular, taller than even Damon man dressed in an oversized grey t-shirt and some shorts.He nodded at Damon as if he knew him already and gestured my way. \"She's with me,\" stated Damon.The guard's eyes went from a chocolate brown to a neon green color that made me jump back when they landed on me. He opened his mouth to reveal a thin and forked black tongue.\"This way,\" he almost hissed the words. He lifted his scaly fingers and pushed the metal door wide open. I didn't hesitate to run after Damon and was met with neon strobing lights that gave me an immediate headache.A club? He brought me to a club?!Damon pushed past hundreds of dancing, sweaty bodies. I tried to not get distracted buy the people and focus on not losing my way. I followed Damon through the crowd until we finally reached the bar where he took a seat and signaled I do the same. \"Damon, what are we doing here-\" I began but he completely ignored me. Instead, he was more focused on the bartender behind the bar who leaned over the counter, her big and perky breasts almost falling out of her top.She had short blond hair and blue eyes that glistened even from a distance. She was tall and skinny and absolutely breathtaking. \"Hi handsome,\" her soft and luring voice could easily have me sitting here for hours just listening to it,\" Bloody Mary?\"She threw her head back and started to laugh and I could notice her teeth now. There were almost double the amount of teeth someone would normally have and each and every single tooth had a pointy tip at the bottom like small fangs. I wondered what she was and wondered what the guard was too. Damon reached into his pockets and pulled out some cash sliding it to the edge of the counter towards the girl.\"Double black out,\" he ordered, seemingly unimpressed. He turned towards me,\" what do you want to drink.\"I'm not 21.I remembered how that had gone with Luna and simply said,\" A coke please.\"The bartender came back with our drinks and as she handed me mines, I caught sight of her fingernails that were long and resembled wood. Almost as if she were growing wooden branches where her nails would be. I gasped out loud and looked up to see that she was already watching me. \"It's smart to carry a meal around with you,\" she looked at me but spoke to Damon,\" that way you don't get too drunk.\"\"Ade, back off,\" Damon spoke calmly and I realized he knew her,\" she's a foreigner.\"Ade's face went from shock to confusion as she turned to look at  Damon.\"Why is she here if she isn't food,\" she snapped.\"I need to think, just back off,\" he repeated. She turned her gaze back at me,\" watch your back little human,\" she spoke through gritted teeth, looking more horrifying than beautiful now,\" this isn't a safe place for you to be.\" I swallowed in fear, unable to break eye contact. She looked away first and strutted to the other side of the bar where a bunch of guys were waving her down.\"Damon,\" I snapped,\" what the hell is this place.\"It was almost as if the music had gone louder on purpose to drown me out because Damon ignored me.\"Damon, where are we-\"\"We're at an Underworld bar,\" he interrupted me, staring into his drink. I wanted to ask what an Underworld bar was but I already knew the answer. Between the bouncer and the bartender, I definitely was not in a bar with fellow humans. \"Why are we here? Why am I here-\"\"There are humans here too, relax,\" he said that as if were meant to reassure me and maybe it did,\" they're called Crones. They are foreigners who know about our kind.\"\"Damon, what are we doing here,\" I repeated. I definitely did not feel like celebrating.\"To have a drink,\" Damon lifted his drink up before bringing it up to his lips to sip. \"What are we going to do? Luna doesn't want to help me, are we going to go back to the castle, what is the Mark of Eros, I didn't even know I had that-\"Before I could finish, we were interrupted by a loud male voice.\"Damon is that you?\" Damon turned back to look at the approaching man. He was tall and lean, with spiky jet black hair and matching eyes that had no pupils. Beside him was a girl with the same hair and eyes as him. She was almost as tall and lean with skin as white and smooth as porcelain. She looked like someone but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. \"Mathoes, Elisabeth,\" Damon greeted, his body tensing up immediately,\" I should have expected to find you here.\"I sensed the aura change as if something bad was suddenly about to happen. \"What are you doing on our side of the woods,\" the girl's voice was slick and smooth.\"Came to visit an old friend.\"\"A fellow Cold One, or was it a witch like your brother does,\" Matheos smiled as if enjoying himself. \"How are you Matheos,\" Damon didn't sound like he let that comment affect him,\" you haven't come by the castle to visit your cousin in a long time.\"\"How is our dear cousin,\" Elisabeth said,\" are you and Seth keeping her busy.\"I immediately knew that they were talking about Isabelle and it clicked in that's who Elisabeth resembled. Matheos's eyes lingered my way and he lost his smile, his expression turning predatory.\"I didn't peg you for the type to play with his food before he eats it,\" his fangs were slightly more extended now and the neon red lights reflected directly off his hungry eyes in a way that made me shiver. I felt Damon's sudden hands clamp around the bottom leg of my stool and pull me closer to him.\"She's a foreigner,\" his voice was calm and he didn't sound as cautious as I knew he felt. Elisabeth skimmed her eyes over my neck, no doubt examining the scars,\" So then who's been breaking the law.\"Damon chucked,\" As if you care about the law.\"Her unamused eyes flickered back towards Damon,\" I care about the council who's going to have a hard time believing your side of the story when your human has more bites on her neck than a villager-\"Damon's voice was angry and authoritative when he snapped,\" I'm handling it.\"I felt my throat clamp up and struggled to form the words that were at the tip of my tongue. I leaned into Damon's shoulder and whispered,\" I'm going to go find a bathroom.\"Damon nodded without looking at me,\" be quick.\"I scrambled to my feet, well aware of Matheos and Elisabeth who had their eyes glued to me. I headed towards the end of the bar where Ade was pouring drinks and leaned in towards her,\" Hi, can you tell me where the bathroom is?\"Her eyes lit up in amusement and she smiled,\" what's in it for me?\"I stayed silent, wondering if she was serious.She placed the newly poured drinks on the table towards a group of guys. One of them leaned towards me,\" she'll never tell you, she's a faerie, keep going this way, it's down that hallway, first door is the one for humans like us.\"I noticed that he had the same bites I had on his neck.I nodded, slightly confused,\" o-ok, thanks.\"I pushed past dozens of bodies before finally finding the hallway and then the bathroom. It was filthy on the inside with paper wet toilet paper covering most of the ground and faucets that were left on. Out of the three stalls, two were in use. Feeling the sudden urge to vomit, I pushed past that and headed towards the vacant stall. After finishing up, being careful not to let myself touch anything, I began to pull up my pants when I noticed the stall beside me had two people in it. From the small distance between them, I could tell that they were in a very tight embrace.I quickly headed out back towards the sinks that looked like they hadn't been cleaned in ages. I washed my hands and examined my tired face in the mirror. I couldn't help but notice how ordinary I looked compared to Luna and Elisabeth and lest I forget Isabelle. I sighed out loud and tried to run my fingers through my hair in an attempt to give it some more volume. In the mirror, I saw the door to the stall behind me open up slightly and reveal the figures inside. My eyes widened in shock when I saw that it was a human. Lips and teeth dug deep into her neck by no doubt, a vampire.She had a smile on her face, her eyes rolling back in pleasure and she was panting something I couldn't quite hear. It looked like the bite was giving her intense pleasure and her hands wrapped around the vampire's head as if trying to pull him closer.She grew louder with her moaning and I could make clear of what she was saying which was,\" more.\" I remembered the man at the bar with the bites on his neck and realized what Damon had meant when he said that there were humans in here too that knew about the Underworld.They weren't friends to the Underworld, they were volunteers. Crones. I quickly left the bathroom and wondered if every human thing I decided to do from now on would be as scarring as this. I couldn't even go to the bathroom without being traumatized. I shivered at the thought of what could be next and began to head back towards Damon when I caught sight of an exit door.It was wide open, at the very back of the bar, the red Exist sign flickering as if alerting my focus. It was unsupervised and I could see the outside from here. I could tell it led to an ally, I could see the bricks from the other side and they were almost inviting me. I looked ahead of me to try to catch sight of Damon but there were too many people in the way.I remembered what I had thought on the way over here. I needed to be home, I needed to get out of this life and forget I had ever been exposed to it.I took a step towards the door, and then another and another until I was finally walking at a brisk pace and before I knew it, I was face to face with the fresh air.I left my feet to do the thinking because my mind felt a twinge of guilt that I couldn't understand. I stepped out and took in the breath of air that tasted like freedom. I looked to my right and left and wondered which way to go. Was I running away?No....just going for a walk. If I happen to get lost....well.Smoke on either side of the alley blocked my sight and I decided to walk towards the right. I wondered if I should be running, but I couldn't bring my feet to do so. It was almost overbearing the feeling of having ditched Damon back at the bar. It was so overbearing that I reconsidered and paused. I thought of his face in the closet the night we had brought back the jester. I felt his cold hands on my face as if he was really there. My heart began to throb. Stop! I forced myself to disperse of those thoughts. I moved my feet again and kept going until I passed the foggy smoke and was confused when it had led me to a brick wall. I grew sudden panicked and searched the brick wall for a way out. It was completely blocked and I banged my hands against the cold hard surface but it didn't budge.I spun on my heel and prepared myself to run past the fog again and towards the other side of the ally where I hoped the real world would await me but to my absolute horror standing right there were two figures. As if having planned the entire thing, they cornered me completely, their gaze fused with hunger, amusement, and something else that I could only describe as evil. Matheos and Elisabeth.

I could hear my sibling's shouter roaring through the thick brick walls separating us. The door is unlocked as it usually is during the day. It's not that we have security much to my disapproval, Mom just prefers it being open during the day since all the kids are wide awake, walking in and out of the house and most likely forgetting their keys and those who are inside just ignore the doorbell when it rings.I take off my shoes and see two blurry figures of my five siblings running after each other. I walk inside and my eyes sweep over Arabella back who's sitting in the lounge room, headset on and busy with the PS5 Dad got her last year for her birthday. I walk toward her and grab the headset. \"You fuc—\" She turns, silver eyes pinning me with the most intense glare until her mouth gapes and her features soften as she jumps over the couch and throws herself around me, \"KNOX! What the hell are you doing here?\"I laugh as I hug her before putting her down on the couch and flicking her pink hair, \"You never told me you dyed your hair.\"She swats my hand away and settles down while I round the couch to sit next to her, throwing my duffle bag at my feet, \"You never called or asked, why should I? Besides it's only a few strands, Mom said I can't do it all because Blue will want to copy me and she's too little to ruin her hair with dye.\"I fold my hands over my chest and stare at the paused game on the TV screen as I push myself further on the couch while guilt chews at me. While I've been busy with work, I did have some time to call, I just never thought that any of my siblings were interested in talking with their much older boring big brother anymore. \"I just thought that you guys were too cool to want to talk to me anymore,\" I try lightly.She snorts, \"You're fu—\"A scream pierces through the air and then another one that sounds a lot like Shea's, \"CAN YOU GUYS SHUT UP FOR JUST THREE DAMN SECONDS?!\"Bells sighs as she grabs her white headset from where I've unconsciously left it between us and resumes her game.\"Whereʼs Mom?\"She lifts one side of her headphones and glances at me from the side of her vision, controller in hand, \"What?\"\"Mom, where is she?\"She shrugs a shoulder, \"Probably getting groceries.\"I nod and stand up to make my way for my bedroom which most likely doesn't feel like my room anymore. The twin's double bed is pushed against one side and my old one against the other. I throw my bag on the neatly made bed and it crinkles a little at the force. When I unzip my duffle to reach for some clothes, I feel the buzzing of my phone. I reach for it and frown at the screen before answering the call and putting it next to my ear, \"Jill, what's up?\"\"Mr Morrison, I'm so sorry to disturb you–\"\"It's fine, I'm guessing you wouldn't have called if everything there was okay.\"\"Yes of course not. There's been some bad news we've discovered Sir.\"I sigh as I put my phone on speaker and let it sit on the bed as I take my shirt off, \"Hit me with Jill.\"I could hear her shuffling on the other end of the phone. Then, her voice, frantic and hurried, loomed through, \"Do you remember Mr. Andy Sterling? I found out that he's paid a few publishers to spread some rumors about you in the tabloids.\"\"It's sad that this is nothing new Jill.\"\"But it is, he's gone far and beyond this time Mr. Morrison. He's accusing you of impregnating his daugh—\"\"Excuse me?!\" I grab the phone, smacking it to my ear as my muscles tense, \"Are you serious Jill? Are you sure these posts are made directly by him and not some crazy fan?\"\"Well, no sir. They're not directly from him and it's just written in a tabloid but I've checked a few resources and found a video of him telling that to a few paparazzi who've followed him. I think he set all of that up, including the paparazzi asking him the question about you and his daughter's relationship. I'll send you all of this in just a minute, I just wanted to alert you about it before anyone on the team does.\"I pinch the bridge of my nose as I heave out a sigh, trying to calm my nerves and posture and to ignore my sibling's shouter from outside the room, \"Thanks, Jill. I appreciate it.\"\"No worries,\" She hangs up and I throw my phone back on the bed, frustrated as I pace back and forth, growing more irritated by the second before deciding to head to the shower to drown myself in the information that's been thrown like a brick at my head.Contrary to popular belief, Oakleyn Sterling and I had nothing in common, and we both realized it when we went on a date that her father had forced upon us. At the end of the night, we mutually agreed that we were better off as acquaintances. It has been a week since then, and while I would like to believe that she had no control over whatever agenda her father was trying to push to show off himself in the industry he failed to rise in, I didn't know her well enough to be sure that she wasn't a part of it.The icy water flowed over me like an electric current and I gritted my teeth, trying to clear my mind before having to face what lay ahead once I left the bathroom.I was so delusional to think I'd have some resemblance of peace coming back home and running away from the world of the spotlight I unconsciously threw myself in thinking of it everything that it wasn't.My eyes closed as I ignored my problems until they manifested themselves in the form of my siblings.\"KNOXY!! Get out now and face your demons, you idiot. I know you're hiding from us!\"\"Blue,\" Forest's voice called, more calmly, \"It sounds like he's having a shower we don't want to t-tram-zaize our eyes.\"I sighed, my head falling against the tiled wall and my body relaxing at the sound of something other than my thoughts as a tiny smile peaked on my face.⇄   ◃◃   ⅠⅠ   ▹▹   ↻I've made the risk to add a huge ass family, idk how I'll keep up w it.
