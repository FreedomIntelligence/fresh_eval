Formulating such robust control mechanics as constrain ed optimization problems of-\nten involves objective and constraint functions that are both non convex and nonsmooth, both\nof which present signiﬁcant challenges to many solvers and their end -users hoping to obtain\ngood solutions to these problems. In our particular engineering tas k, the main diﬃculty in\nthe optimization arises in a nonsmooth and nonconvex stability const raint, which states that\nthe inﬁnite spectrum of zeros of the so-called shaper should remain in the open left half-plane.\nTo perform our evaluation, we make use β-relative minimization proﬁles, recently introduced\nvisualization tools that are particularly suited for benchmarking solv ers on nonsmooth, non-\nconvex, constrained optimization problems. Furthermore, we also introduce new visualization\ntools, called Global-Local Proﬁles, which for a given problem and a ﬁxe d computational budget,\nassess the tradeoﬀs of distributing the budget over few or many s tarting points, with the former\ngetting more budget per point and latter less.\n1 Introduction\nConsider the following general constrained optimization p roblem\nmin\nx∈Rnf(x) s.t./braceleftBigg\ncj(x)≤0j∈ {1,...,m}\ncj(x) = 0 j∈ {m+1,...,q}, (1.1)\nwhere the objective function f:Rn→Rand each individual (in)equality constraint function\ncj:Rn→Rare all continuous but may possibly be nonsmooth. We assume t hat the functions are\nstill continuously diﬀerentiable almost everywhere; as suc h, the nonsmoothness of fand each cjis\nlimited to a set of measure zero in Rn. To date, much of the literature for nonsmooth optimization\nhas focused on unconstrained minimization, without any cjconstraint functions; e.g. see [BKM14].\nHowever, a couple of new solvers speciﬁcally intended for no nsmooth, constrained optimization\nhave recently appeared, opening upnew possibilities for re liably solving actual applications that are\nmodeled by (1.1) in practice, despite the challenging prope rties of the objective and/or constraint\nfunctions.\n∗Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Electrical Engi neering, Czech Technical University in Prague,\nvyacheslav.kungurtsev@fel.cvut.cz\n†Max Planck Institutefor Dynamics of Complex Technical Syst ems Magdeburg, mitchell@mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de\n‡Department of Instrumentation and Control Engineering, Fa culty of Mechanical Engineering, and Czech Institute\nof Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics, Czech Technical University in Prague, tomas.vyhlidal@fs.cvut.cz\n1In 2012, [CO12] proposed combining gradient sampling (GS), a nonsmooth optimization tech-\nnique for unconstrained minimization [BLO05], with sequen tial quadratic programming (SQP) to\nadditionally handle (possibly nonsmooth) constraints. Th e resulting algorithm, simply called SQP-\nGS, was shown to have provable convergence to stationary poi nts of (1.1), assuming that all the\nfunctions fandcjare locally Lipschitz and that such stationary points are su ﬃciently calm(for\ndetails on calmness, see [Bur91a, Bur91b]). On the other han d, the gradient-sampling procedure\nemployed within SQP-GS requires evaluating O(n) gradients (for each of the particular fandcj\nfunctions that are nonsmooth) at every iteration, which can make SQP-GS a computationally ex-\npensive method, especially if the cost to compute these func tions is nontrivial. This potential high\ncost is further exacerbated by the fact that nonsmooth optim ization methods generally have slow\nconvergence rates (i.e. typically linear), due to the lack o f exploitable smoothly varying curva-\nture at nonsmooth minimizers, and can thus incur many iterat ions before satisfactorily meeting\nstationarity conditions.\nMore recently, in 2017, a philosophically diﬀerent algorith m [CMO17] for solving (1.1) was\nproposed, i.e. one that does not rely on gradient sampling an d which instead typically only re-\nquiresO(1) gradient evaluations on average per iteration, thus pot entially making it signiﬁcantly\nfaster than SQP-GS. Inspired by the observed eﬃciency and re liability of quasi-Newton methods\nfornonsmoothunconstrainedoptimization [LO13], speciﬁc ally Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shannon\n(BFGS) updating, the authors of [CMO17] proposed a new BFGS- SQP method as a fast and reli-\nable alternative to SQP-GS. This BFGS-SQP algorithm is impl emented in a code called GRANSO:\nGRadient-based Algorithm for Non-Smooth Optimization [Mi tb]. Although there are currently\nno theoretical convergence guarantees for the underlying B FGS-SQP method, it was shown that\nGRANSO can be a competitive solver in practice compared to SQ P-GS [CMO17, Section 6]. On a\nlarge test set of challenging nonsmooth, nonconvex, constr ained optimization problems [Mitc], half\nof which were not even locally Lipschitz, GRANSO often fared well relative to SQP-GS in terms of\nminimization quality and ﬁnding the feasible region, all wh ile being many times faster than SQP-\nGS (typically over an order of magnitude faster, which, for t hose problems, was in line with the\nexpectation of being faster by a factor of O(n) as the dominant cost in the running times was the\nfunction/gradient evaluations). Additionally, the “oﬀ-th e-shelf” solvers (i.e., those not speciﬁcally\ndeveloped fornonsmoothproblems)includedasbaselines in theevaluation donein [CMO17] didnot\nperform well at all, highlighting the necessity for purpose -built solvers for nonsmooth optimization.\nReturning to our speciﬁc motivation of using nonsmooth, con strained optimization solvers to\ndesign time-delay compensators, so-called input shapers , the overall goal is to shape the movements\nof a main-body system (e.g. a crane trolley) in order to damp t he oscillatory modes of a connected\nﬂexible subsystem (e.g. a payload suspended from a crane tro lley). Cast as an optimization\nproblem, the design of such input shapers in this paper takes the following general form:\nmin\nx∈RnxTQxs.t.\n\nA1x≤b1\nA2x=b2\ns(x)≤0, (1.2)\nwhereQ∈Rn×nis positive deﬁnite, A1∈Rm×n,A2∈Rp×n, ands:Rn→Ris a continuous\nbut nonsmooth and nonconvex function that is possibly also n ot locally Lipschitz. The quadratic\nobjective function models desired performance characteri stics in the frequency domain, while the\nlinear constraints specify necessary structural requirem ents. Thenonlinear and nonsmooth inequal-\nity constraint simposes a stability constraint on the shaper, namely that it s spectrum, which is\ninﬁnite for the given class of time-delay systems, must enti rely reside in the open left half-plane.\nNote however that (1.2) is applicable to a wide range of relat ed problems in control system theory\n2where fast and robustly stable transient characteristics m ust be balanced.\nWithout explicitly enforcing stability of the shaper, the r esulting shaper may have unstable\nmodes which could destabilize the closed-loop system [VHKA 16a]. Consequently, in [KPV+17],\ndesigning a stableinput shaper via optimizing a speciﬁc form of (1.2) with cons traintsenforcing\nstability was proposed, which the authors noted was the ﬁrst use of optimization to stabilize an\ninput shaper via moving its zeros into the open left half-pla ne. However, attempting to solve\n(1.2) with SQP-GS, the only solver speciﬁcally designed for nonsmooth, nonconvex, constrained\noptimization that was available to the authors at the time of those initial experiments, was not\na straightforward matter. First, since the constraint func tionsmay not be locally Lipschitz, the\nconvergence guarantees for SQP-GS might not even apply for ( 1.2). Second, these convergence\nguarantees, even if they did apply, do not say anything about whether or not a resulting computed\nsolution will be feasible; in other words, the convergence g uarantees do not preclude SQP-GS from\nconverging to an infeasiblestationary point. Third, as the authors of [KPV+17, Section 4, p. 13327]\nnoted, SQP-GS was indeed quite slow in practice. While a stab le input shaper was successfully\nobtained by optimizing a speciﬁc example of (1.2) via SQP-GS [KPV+17, Section 4], the diﬃculties\nof doing so were beyond the scope of the article and thus were n ot reported in detail, e.g. how\nmany starting points were required in order to ﬁnd at least on e stable inputshaper and exactly how\nlong did it take SQP-GS to compute these shapers. These are re levant issues for engineers actually\nattempting to employ this new methodology and with the recen t availability of GRANSO, which\nmight potentially solve (1.2) signiﬁcantly faster than SQP -GS, there is now also the question of\nwhich solver to use in this or similar applications. As such, the questions of what is the current best\npractice for solving input shaper design problems of the for m (1.2), and at what expense, remain.\nIn this paper, we aim to address these concerns. Furthermore , as alluded to earlier, our evaluation\nof SQP-GS and GRANSO can potentially be informative for othe r related robust control design\ntasks as these often involve nonsmoothness arising from sta bility constraints and/or max functions.\nOf course, comparing the performance of competing solvers o n a nonsmooth, nonconvex, con-\nstrained optimization problem is a multi-faceted aﬀair. Fir st, just the ability of a method to\nconsistently ﬁnd feasible solutions is paramount, particu larly for nonlinear constraints since feasi-\nble points may not be knowable a priori and methods may not alw ays ﬁnd the feasible region for\nevery starting point. Given feasibility, of second importa nce is the quality of objective function\nminimization, that is, how far has the objective function be en reduced. With nonconvexity, this is\nnot a well-deﬁned goal since methods could converge to diﬀere nt local minimizers. Furthermore,\nwith a possibly non-locally-Lipschitz function present in our optimization problem, there are no\nguarantees that the methods will not stagnate before reachi ng stationary points. However, from a\nuser’s perspective, whichever feasible answer minimizes t he objective function the most would be\npreferred. Finally, the computational eﬀort necessary to me et feasibility requirements and suﬃ-\nciently minimize the objective must also be considered. Bey ond diﬀerent per-iteration costs that\nmethods may have, this metric of interest is also complicate d by the facts that (a) the rate of\nprogress of any given method may be highly variable during op timization and (b) that reasonable\ncomputational budgets of users cannot typically be reliabl y estimated or predicted by others. As\nsuch, to increase the utility of benchmarks for users, it can be imperative to consider multiple\nbudgets. To handle such complicated benchmarking objectiv es, where the three goals of ﬁnding\nfeasibility, objective minimization, and computational e ﬃciency are also often at odds with one\nanother, β-Relative Minimization Proﬁles ( β-RMPs or just RMPs) were proposed as new visualiza-\ntion tools to concisely address all these facets [CMO17, Sec tion 5]. To help assess what is the best\npractice for solving our input shaper design problem, we emp loyβ-RMP benchmarking to compare\nSQP-GS and GRANSO.\nFinally, we propose new visualization tools, called Global-Local Proﬁles (GL-Proﬁles) , to help\n3resolve a particular quandary when it comes to nonconvex and /or nonsmooth optimization, where\ndiﬀerent local minima may be found and/or where convergence m ight be quite slow. Given a ﬁxed\ncomputational budget, the question is then how to best utili ze that budget in order to obtain good\nsolutions to such a problem. One could devote the budget to ru ns from just one or a few starting\npoints, to allow local minimizers to be obtained precisely ( i.e. reaching stationarity conditions).\nAlternatively, one could distribute the budget over many st arting points, where the much smaller\nbudget per starting point means that minimizers will typica lly not be found so accurately but\nnevertheless, the best minimizer amongst those obtained co uld be much better than what would be\nfound by only using few starting points. GL-Proﬁles present this tradeoﬀ in a concise and intuitive\nmanner and describe not only the relative performance diﬀere nces of the solvers but also speak to\nthe ease or diﬃculty of ﬁndinggood solutions that is inheren t to a particular nonconvex/nonsmooth\nproblem of interest itself.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide b ackground and details on the input\nshaper design optimization problem with the nonsmooth stab ility constraint. In Section 3, we ﬁrst\ngive a brief overview of the SQP-GS algorithm and then the BFG S-SQP method employed within\nGRANSO. We describe our experimental setup for designing st able input shapers in Section 4,\nwhile also giving a preliminary analysis of our results. In S ection 5, we provide a primer on β-\nRMPs for the convenience of the reader and then do a β-RMP benchmark comparing SQP-GS and\nGRANSO for our input shaper design problem. To address the qu estion of how to best utilize a\nﬁxed computational budget for nonconvex/nonsmooth optimi zation problems, we ﬁrst introduce\nour new GL-Proﬁles and then do a GL-Proﬁle benchmark to compa re both methods with this new\ncomplementary perspective in Section 6. Final remarks are g iven in Section 7.\n2 The input shaper design problem using distributed delays\nInput shaping is a well-known technique for damping undesir able oscillatory modes of mechanical\nsystems, to intelligently control the motions of a main-bod y such that when it comes to a stop,\nthe ﬂexible subsystem also returns to a stand still as quickl y as possible. Input shaping via the\nuse of time-delay ﬁlters was ﬁrst proposed and implemented b y Smith [Smi57] in the 1950s and\nthen further extended to robust and multi-mode design tasks [SS90, SSS94, TS94] in the 1990s.\nIn addition to the aforementioned typical crane problem [VK S10, SKK08], input shapers have also\nbeen used in many other applications, such as position contr ol of ﬂexible manipulators [PTDF09]\nand vibration suppression in robotics [PCPL06]. For an exte nsive review on input shaping over the\nlast 50 years, see [Sin09].\nThe speciﬁc control application represented by (1.2) that w e consider here arises from the\nuse of a distributed-delay shaper [VKH13, VH15], where the inverse of the designed shaper is\nincorporated into the feedback loop of a control system, a te chnique proposed in [VHKA16b] (see\nalso [HV17]). The beneﬁt of such an approach is that it extend s the applicability of input shaping\nto compensating the ﬂexible modes induced by both reference signal and disturbances. In [VH15],\nan optimization-based approach for designing such an input shaper was proposed with the form\nof (1.2) but without the constraint s(x)<0 and where, for robustness, the objective function was a\nleast-squares measure of the residual vibrations across a s mall frequency range around the desired\noscillation to be compensated. However, by including the in verse of the shaper in the feedback\nloop, zeros of the shaper are likely to be “turned into” poles of the closed-loop system, as addressed\nin [VHKA16b]. As closed-loop stability is required, it thus makes sense to add the condition that\nall zeros of the input shaper must reside in the open left half -plane, which will be modeled by the\ns(x)<0 constraint in (1.2). As mentioned in the introduction, a pr eliminary optimization-based\n4approach usingSQP-GStoenforcethisnonsmoothstability c onstraint wasconsideredin [KPV+17].\nIn more detail, we ﬁrst describe an input shaper with a distri buted delay. Given T >0, a\nconstant specifying the longest delay, let {τ1,...,τn}be the set of equally distributed delays in\n[0,T], indexed in increasing order, with τ1= 0 and τn=T. The speciﬁc input shaper with delays\nproposed in [VH15] is characterized by the equation\ny(t) =γu(t)+/integraldisplayT\n0u(t−µ)dh(µ), (2.1)\nwhereuandyare respectively the shaper input and output, γ∈(0,1) is the gain parameter,\nand the distribution of the delays is prescribed by the non-d ecreasing function h(µ), with length\nT(though again, we here will only focus on equally-distribut ed delays). Considering the step-wise\ndistribution of the delays, the corresponding transfer fun ctionD:C→Cof (2.1) has the following\nform:\nD(s) =γ+1\nsn/summationdisplay\nk=1xke−sτk, (2.2)\nwherexkis the respective gain for each delay spike with delay τk. The set of xkvalues comprise\nour set of optimization variables.\nIn the classical feed-forward interconnection of the shape rD(s) and the ﬂexible subsystem F(s),\nwhich acts as D(s)F(s), the mode compensation takes place via cancellation of the oscillatory pole\nofF(s) by a zero of the shaper D(s). The purpose of including the inverse shaper is to pre-\ncompensate the oscillatory modes of the ﬂexible subsystem F(s) when controlling the main-body\nsystemG(s) via the controller C(s). In contrast to the classical feed-forward application of the\nshaperD(s)F(s), incorporating the inverse of the shaper allows ﬂexible mo des that are excited\nby disturbances dto also be compensated. This feature results from the corres ponding transfer\nfunctions from the system reference wto the system output y\nTy,w(s) =C(s)G(s)\n1+C(s)G(s)1\nD(s)F(s) =C(s)G(s)\nD(s)+C(s)G(s)D(s)F(s), (2.3)\nand from the system output disturbance dto the system output y\nTy,d(s) =1\n1+C(s)G(s)1\nD(s)F(s) =1\nD(s)+C(s)G(s)D(s)F(s). (2.4)\nNote that the term D(s)F(s) appears in both the transfer functions, which conﬁrms that the\noscillatory mode compensation takes place in both of the cha nnels. Furthermore, note that the\ncharacteristic equation determining the closed-loop pole s is in both cases given by\nD(s)+C(s)G(s) = 0. (2.5)\nIfC(s)G(s) is a strictly-proper transfer function, then lim |s|→∞|C(s)G(s)|= 0, and so the closed-\nloop poles with large magnitudes will tend to match the spect rum ofD(s) zeros. For more details,\nparticularly if C(s)G(s) is bi-proper, we refer the reader to [VHKA16b].\nAs designing a robust input shaper can lead to the shaper havi ng a large number of zeros in the\nright half-plane (see [KPV+17, Section 2.2]), designing C(s), thecontroller for the system G(s)1\nD(s),\nwould also have the additional task of restricting all the po les of the closed-loop system to the open\nleft half-plane. However, the inclusion of the aforementio ned stability constraint to restrict the\n5zeros of the shaper to open left half-plane greatly reduces t his burden on the controller. This leads\nto deﬁning the so-called zeros spectral abscissa of the input shaper D(s):\nαD:= max{ℜλ: for allλ∈Csuch that D(λ) = 0}. (2.6)\nIn this paper, we only consider stability from the perspecti ve of the zeros of the shaper; extension\nto the full closed-loop system has not yet been in the conside ration in the literature but will be the\nsubject of future work.\nWe now present the speciﬁc optimization problem for designi ng the gains of the delay spikes in\nthe input shaper. As its derivation is both technical and not directly relevant to our goal of how\nbest to solve it in practice, we omit many of these details her e and instead just refer the reader\nto [PMV17] for how they exactly arise. Given (2.1) as the chos en realization of the shaper, with\ndeﬁning constants T,n, andγ, the optimal stableshaper is obtained via solving\nmin\nx∈RnxTHx\nR2noms.t.\n\nA1x≤b1\nA2x=b2\nαD(x)≤αc, (2.7)\nwhereA1∈R(n−1)×nandb1∈Rnin the linear inequality constraints are deﬁned by\n−l/summationdisplay\nk=1xk≤0 forl∈ {1,...,n−1}, (2.8)\nA2∈R2×nandb2∈R2in the linear equality constraints are deﬁned by\nn/summationdisplay\nk=1xk= 0 and γ−n/summationdisplay\nk=1xkτk= 1, (2.9)\nH∈Rn×nis positive deﬁnite, Rnom>0,αD(x) is the zeros spectral abscissa of the shaper D(s) as a\nfunction of optimization variables x, and constant αc≤0.

The\nlinear inequality constraints (2.8) ensure the desired non -decreasing step response of the shaper\nwhile the linear equality constraints (2.9) guarantee that the static gain of the shaper D(s) remains\nequal to one, so as to not otherwise inﬂuence the system. The c hoice of the nonpositive constant αc\nallows one to optionally enforce that the zeros of the shaper not just merely be in the left half-plane\nbut that they be at least |αc|away from the imaginary axis.\nRemark 2.10 We note that we present (2.7)with a few technical/notational diﬀerences from what\nis used in the preceding control literature. First, in order to maintain consistency with (1.2)and\nthe convention of the solvers in our evaluation, we ﬂipped th e≥relation for linear inequalities\nto≤, i.e. by implicitly multiplying them by −1. Second, we use γto denote the initial gain,\ninstead of Aas has been done elsewhere. Third, in previous literature, th e initial gain γwas\nembedded as the ﬁrst element of a vector xalso containing the individual gains to be optimized,\ni.e.x:= [γ x1... xn]T. Rewriting the problem with γremoved from xis straightforward and can\nstill be rewritten as the quadratic program plus a nonsmooth constraint we give in (2.7). However,\nto accommodate this (small) reformulation of the vector of g ains, it means the matrices we refer\nto above are correspondingly transformed versions of those deﬁned in the aforementioned control\nliterature, and are thus not the same.\n62.1 The zeros spectral abscissa\nAs a max function, the zeros spectral abscissa of a time-dela y system will, in general, be nonsmooth\nwhen there are ties, that is when there is more than a single gl obally rightmost zero (ignoring\nconjugacy). Furthermore, as the spectral abscissa of a line ar system is known to be non-Lipschitz\nwhen an eigenvalue attaining the spectral abscissa has mult iplicity greater than one [BO01], the\nzeros spectral abscissa is also not Lipschitz, since a linea r system is simply a special case of a time-\ndelay system. As such, one should expect that optimizing the spectrum of a time-delay system\nwill, in general, be at least as hard as that of a linear one.\nTo compute the zeros spectral abscissa of D(s) as a function of the optimization variables x,\nthat isαD(x), we actually instead consider computing roots of sD(s), i.e.λ∈Csuch that\nλD(λ) =λγ+n/summationdisplay\nk=1xke−λτk= 0. (2.11)\nThe reason for this is that the roots of equation (2.11), whic h is of retarded quasi-polynomial form,\ncan be determined as the poles of the associated retarded tim e-delay system\n˙y(t) =−1\nγn/summationdisplay\nk=1xky(t−τk), (2.12)\nand so the roots of (2.11) can be computed via the method of [WM 12], which is available as an\nopen-source MATLAB code.1Note that considering sD(s) = 0 introduces an additional root at\nthe origin, but this is simply removed from the computed set o f roots.\nIngeneral, (2.11)hasinﬁnitelymanysolutions. However, d uetoγ >0, thespectrumisretarded.\nFor retarded systems, the number of roots satisfying ℜλ > βfor anyβ∈Ris always ﬁnite [HL13].\nThis is in constrast to neutral time-delay systems, where th e number of roots located to the right\nof a given vertical line speciﬁed by βcan be inﬁnite. Thus, a neutral system can have inﬁnitely\nmany unstable roots, which in turn makes stabilizing them mo re diﬃcult than retarded systems,\nwhich only have ﬁnitely many unstable roots. Note that a clas sical shaper with lumped delays has\na neutral spectrum. Avoiding this undesirable spectrum dis tribution, especially for the case when\nthe shaper is applied in the inverse form, was the main reason why distributed-delay shapers were\nintroduced [VKH13].\nAlthough apparently not yet rigorously proven, the zeros sp ectral abscissa at least seems to be\ndiﬀerentiable almost everywhere with respect to the delay ga insx, even though it is still ultimately\nnonsmooth [MN07, Section 10.2.1]. Let ˆ xbe any set of speciﬁc gains such that αD(x) is smooth\nat ˆx, withλ1∈Cbeing a simple globally rightmost zero of (2.11) (again, exc luding conjugacy).\nIt then follows from straightforward diﬀerentiation with re spect to xthat the gradient of the zeros\nspectral abscissa at ˆ xis given by\n∇αD(x)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle\nx=ˆx=−ℜ/parenleftBigg/bracketleftbig\ne−λ1τ1... e−λ1τn/bracketrightbigT\nγ−/summationtextn\nk=1τkˆxke−λ1τk/parenrightBigg\n. (2.13)\nAlthough computing the zeros of the shaper can be nontrivial , the subsequent gradient calculation\nis relatively straightforward and inexpensive to obtain.\n1http://twr.cs.kuleuven.be/research/software/delay-c ontrol/roots/\n73 Descriptions of SQP-GS and GRANSO\nFor brevity in describing the algorithms, we will limit the d iscussion in this section to inequality\nconstrained optimization but we note that both methods can a lso handle equality constraints and\nindeed, for the optimization problems we wish to solve here, we require methods that are applicable\nfor problems with both equality and inequality constraints . Assuming that all the functions in (1.1)\nare locally Lipschitz, by Rademacher’s Theorem [RW09], it f ollows that any nondiﬀerentiability\nmust be restricted to sets of measure zero, if at all. In our se tting here, we will assume that there is\nalways at least onefunctionin (1.1) that is nonsmooth. Neve rtheless, even whenthenonsmoothness\nof (1.1) is restricted to just a set of measure zero, this is st ill often an insurmountable challenge to\novercome for many optimization methods that are not speciﬁc ally built for nonsmooth optimization\nin mind. In particular, in many applications, minimizers of (1.1) will typically be points at which\none of the functions is nondiﬀerentiable.\nOne potential way to solve (1.1) is by minimizing a (nonsmoot h)penalty function , an approach\nemployed by both SQP-GS and GRANSO. Consider the l1penalty function\nφ(x;ρ):=ρf(x)+v(x) (3.1)\nwherepenalty parameter ρ >0balances the(sometimes opposing)goals ofminimizingthe objective\nand satisfying the constraints and v:Rn→Rmeasures the total violation of constraints, deﬁned\nas\nv(x):=/ba∇dblmax{c(x),0}/ba∇dbl1=/summationdisplay\nj∈Pxcj(x) where Px:={j∈ {1,...,m}:cj(x)>0}.(3.2)\nIf an acceptable value of ρis known a priori, then solving (3.1) via a suitable unconstrained opti-\nmization method will also yield a solution to the constraine d problem (1.1) (see [Bur91a, Bur91b]).\nOf course in practice, this is often not the case and the respo nsibility of ﬁnding a good value for ρ\nfalls upon the constrained optimization method.\n3.1 SQP-GS\nIn order to overcome any discontinuities in the gradients of the objective or constraint functions, re-\nspectively ∇fand∇cj, SQP-GS ﬁnds a stationary point of (1.1) by solving a sequenc e of quadratic\nprograms augmented by additional gradient information obt ained by random sampling. At each\niteration, ∇fand∇cjare randomly sampled from ǫ-neighborhoods around the current iterate xk;\nwe denote these respective sets of sampled gradients by Bf\nǫ,kand{Bcj\nǫ,k}m\nj=1. For now, we will assume\nthat the objective and constraint functions are all nonsmoo th. In order for the convergence results\nof SQP-GS to hold, each set must contain at least n+ 1 sampled gradients (in addition to the\ngradient at xk) but in practice, it is usually recommended to sample more th an this (e.g. 2 n).\nThen to compute a descent direction d, the following subproblem of (1.1) is solved:\nmin\nd,z,rρz+m/summationdisplay\nj=1rj+1\n2dTHkd\ns.t.f(xk)+∇f(x)Td≤z,∀x∈ Bf\nǫ,k\ncj(xk)+∇cj(x)Td≤rj,∀x∈ Bcj\nǫ,k, rj≥0,∀j∈ {1,...,m},(3.3)\nwhereρis the aforementioned penalty parameter, z∈Randrj∈Rare slack variables, and\nHkis a BFGS approximation of the Lagrangian Hessian that is mai ntained and updated at every\n8iteration. Then given the descent direction dobtained by solving (1.1), a backtracking line search\nis performed to compute the next iterate xk+1such that suﬃcient decrease of the penalty function\n(3.1) is satisﬁed.\nAssuming that all the functions in (1.1) are indeed locally L ipschitz, then with probability one,\nSQP-GS is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of (1. 1) but this computed stationary\npoint may be either a feasible or infeasible one. Note that th e convergence results for SQP-GS also\nrequire that the BFGS Hessian approximation remain bounded , which is enforced in the 1.2 and\nlater versions of its implementation. As mentioned earlier , the main downside to using SQP-GS is\nthe many gradient samples ( O(n)) that need to be evaluated on each iteration, which can make\nSQP-GS a very expensive method to use, perhaps prohibitivel y so, when the functions and/or\ngradients are expensive to evaluate. Unfortunately, this i s often the case for applications in robust\ncontrol, including the problem we consider in this paper. Ne vertheless, it is only necessary to\napply the gradient sampling procedure to the speciﬁc functi ons that are actually nonsmooth and\nso SQP-GS allows a user to set the number of samples individua lly for each individual function.\nWhile we will make use of this feature to only enable gradient sampling for the nonsmooth zeros\nspectral abscissa, the relative cost of computing the remai ning smooth functions and their gradients\nis so negligible that such selected gradient sampling will o nly marginally improve the computational\nburden for our speciﬁc problem.\n3.2 GRANSO\nTo avoid the potentially high overhead that SQP-GS can have, GRANSO completely eschews\ngradient sampling. Instead, inspired by the wealth of evide nce that regular BFGS is a reliable\nand eﬃcient method for unconstrained nonsmooth optimizati on (e.g. [LO13]), GRANSO uses\nBFGS updating as a tool for solving nonsmooth constrained pr oblems, in the form of (1.1), via\nﬁnding a minimizer of the penalty function (3.1). However, t he choice of determining a good value\nfor the penalty parameter ρstill remains an issue. To address this, GRANSO combines BFG S\nupdating with an SQP-based steering strategy. Originally proposed by [BNW08, BLCN12] for\nsmooth problems, steering attempts to dynamically determi ne at every iteration whether or not\nthe current value of ρshould be lowered, and by how much, in order to promote suﬃcie nt progress\ntowards the feasible region. This strategy works as follows .\nConsider the following quadratic program:\nmin\nd,rρ(f(xk)+∇f(xk)Td)+m/summationdisplay\nj=1rj+1\n2dTHkd\ns.t.cj(xk)+∇cj(xk)Td≤rj, rj≥0,∀j∈ {1,...,m}.(3.4)\nAt each iterate xk, in order to determine a new descent direction dk, GRANSO will solve (3.4) one\nor more times, for diﬀerent trial values of the penalty parame ter. Note if ρ= 1 and there are no\nconstraints, solving (3.4) would just yield the standard BF GS direction. First, GRANSO solves\n(3.4) for the current value of the penalty parameter to produ ce a candidate direction d. Using\na linearized model of constraint violation, GRANSO compute s the predicted reduction in total\nviolation if the candidate direction dis used, that is,\nlδ(d;xk):=v(xk)−/ba∇dblmax{c(xk)+∇c(xk)Td,0}/ba∇dbl1. (3.5)\nIf the prediction reduction given by (3.5) is deemed suﬃcien tly large, then the computed direction\ndand the current value of the penalty parameter are considere d to suﬃciently promote progress\n9towards the feasible region and dis accepted as the new search direction dkwhileρremains\nunaltered. Otherwise, (3.4) is re-solved with ρtemporarily set to zero to obtain ˜dk, which is called\nthereference direction . Withρtemporarily set at zero, the objective function and its grad ient are\nremoved from (3.4). Thus, the reference direction is biased towards reducing the current violation\nv(xk) as much as possible regardless of what eﬀect it may have on the objective function. Using\nthe predicted violation reduction for the reference direct ion,lδ(˜dk;xk), which models the best case\nreduction in violation one might achieve, GRANSO then re-so lves (3.4) for successively lower values\nofρuntil it produces a direction dsuch that lδ(d;xk) is some suﬃciently large fraction of lδ(˜dk;xk).\nIn other words, in this latter scenario, GRANSO computes a di rectiondkthat is predicted to reduce\nthe violation by at least, say 10% for example, of the amount t hat the reference direction ˜dkwould.\nAn inexact Armijo-Wolfe line search is then used with direct iondkto compute the next iterate and\nthe BFGS Hessian approximation Hkis updated.\n4 Experimental setup and preliminary analysis\nFor setting up the speciﬁc instance of (2.7), we chose to opti mize an input shaper with 18 equally-\nspaced delays ( n= 18) with T= 0.8,γ= 0.01, andαc=−0.1 to keep the zeros of the shaper\na bit away from the stability boundary. To assess the diﬃcult y of solving this 18-variable robust\ncontrol design task and benchmark SQP-GS and GRANSO, we ran b oth solvers on two diﬀerent\nsets of 1000 starting points, each constructed as follows. F or the ﬁrst set, we simply created\nrandom starting points generated via randn, a common (and often default) choice for most solvers\nand practitioners when no other information is known about t he problem’s solution(s) a priori.\nThe second set also contained 1000 randomly-generated star ting points, but created using uniform\ndistributions such that these initial points at least satis ﬁed all of the linear inequality constraints\nand the ﬁrst of the two linear equality constraints. We will h erein respectively refer to these two\nsets as the “ randn” and “LC” points, with the latter standing for “Linear Const raints”. We did not\nattempt to construct initial points that satisﬁed all linea r constraints and/or the nonlinear zeros\nspectral abscissa constraint.\nFor the implementation of the optimization problem, we were provided the MATLAB code\nused for the experiments done in [KPV+17] and other related papers. However, we modiﬁed this\ncode so that the implemented objective and constraint funct ions agreed with the formal shaper\noptimization problem we present here. In this process, we al so increased the code’s eﬃciency and\nreliability when evaluating these function/gradient and d id code cleanup and modularization, to\nfacilitate our larger evaluation.\nFor the solvers, we speciﬁcally used SQP-GS v1.3 and GRANSO v 1.6 and allowed each solver\na maximum of 1000 iterations per starting point. We set both c odes to use a stationarity tolerance\nof 10−8. In order for an iterate to be considered (suﬃciently) feasi ble, we set the tolerances of both\nsolvers so that the inequality constraints had to be strictl y satisﬁed while the total violation of the\nequality constraints could be no more than 10−8. For additional consistency, we set the initial value\nof the penalty parameter of both SQP-GS ( rhoinit) and GRANSO ( opts.mu0 ) to 1. Finally, for\nSQP-GS, we set the number of gradient samples for the nonsmoo th spectral abscissa constraint to\nbe 2n, the recommended value noted in its documentation and relev ant papers ([CO12, Section 4]\nand [BLO05, Section 4]). Otherwise, all other parameters of the two codes were left at their defaults\nand both codes used the builtin quadprog routine provided in MATLAB to solve their respective\nQP subproblems.\nThe experiments were computed over a subset of identical com pute nodes of the mechthild\ncluster located at MPI Magdeburg. where each node has two Int el Xeon Silver 4110 CPUs with\n10randn LC\nGRANSO SQP-GS Ratio GRANSO SQP-GS Ratio\nTotal Wall-Clock Time (days) 2.12 83.1797 39.16 1.28 31.96 31.10\nTotal Iters 107,491 248,254 2.31 54,151 118,565 2.19\nAverage Time Per Iter (min/iter) 0.03 0.48 16.96 0.03 0.39 14.20\nTable 1: Total cost statistics for each solver, on each of the two test sets of 1000 diﬀerent starting\npoints.

No te however that very\nlittle memory was actually needed for the experiments. As bo th SQP-GS and GRANSO are serial\nprograms, the only exploited parallelism was in the experim ental setup, to distribute the 2000\ndiﬀerent starting points over multiple nodes. The cumulativ e serial time of all our experiments\n(measured using ticandtoc) was 118 days, with SQP-GS being accountable for 97% of the to tal\ncomputation time.\n4.1 Preliminary performance analysis\nIn Table 1, we provide basic cost statistics for performing t he experiments, for each pair of solver\nandstartingpoint set. Therelative high cost of runningSQP -GSis clearly evident, withit requiring\nabout 31 times longer than GRANSO to complete the LC test set a nd needing 39 times longer on\ntherandntest set. While GRANSO completed both test sets in 3.4 days, S QP-GS took over 115\ndays. Interestingly, part of this large diﬀerence was not jus t the additional cost for SQP-GS to\nobtainO(n) gradient samples every iteration but also because SQP-GS a lso took over twice the\nnumber of iterations compared to GRANSO. Compared to the randnstarting points, we see that\nusing LC starting points reduces the total time and iteratio ns for both solvers, by a factor of two,\nroughly speaking. We also see that more often than not both so lvers are terminating well before\ntheir 1000 maximum allowed iteration limit.\nIn Figure 1a, for each of the randnstarting points, we plot the best objective value encounter ed\nby each solver. The plot is sorted in decreasing order with re spect to these best objective values,\nwith the infeasible solutions plotted ﬁrst. An infeasible s olution means that a solver was not able to\never ﬁnd the feasible set when initialized at that particula r starting point. A dramatic performance\ndiﬀerence between GRANSO and SQP-GS is immediately apparent , namely that SQP-GS only\nﬁnds the feasible sets for just less than half (477 of 1000) of therandntest set while GRANSO\nﬁnds the feasible set for 922 of the 1000 randnstarting points. On the other hand, of the feasible\nsolutions found, we see that SQP-GS found a larger portion of the best solutions, even though the\nvery best solution was computed by GRANSO.\nIn Figure 1b, we provide the same type of plot but now for the LC starting points. We more\nor less see the same overall picture, with a couple notable di ﬀerences. First, initializing from\nthe LC points allows both solvers to slightly increase their respective success rates in ﬁnding the\nfeasible region, which is not so surprisinggiven the constr uction of the LC points to partially satisfy\nfeasibility. Second, both solvers on average seem to return better solutions, ones corresponding to\nsomewhat lower objective values, when initialized from the LC points, with this positive change\nbeing slightly more prominent for SQP-GS. Nevertheless, th e very best solution was also computed\nby GRANSO on the LC test set.\n110 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000\nDifferent starting points10-610-510-410-310-210-1Objective valueBest minimizers obtained for different starting points\nPoints are feasible if: TV Ineq.  0 and TV Eq.  1e-08\nGRANSO infeas.

A solution is considered feasible if its total violation for the\ninequality constraints (TV Ineq.) is less than zero and its t otal violation for the equality constraints\n(TV Eq.) is at most 10−8. Note that use of log scale on the y-axis, as the best objective values\nspan a great range.\nPlots like the ones we show in Figures 1a and 1b are useful for a ssessing how many diﬀerent\nstationary points a nonconvex problem may have, which would appear as plateaus due to the\nsorting of the solutions by objective value. However, neith er plot seems to show any evidence of\nplateaus. Instead, both show a rather smoothly-varying dec rease in the objective values. One\npossible explanation is that there is only one feasible mini mizer and perhaps a second infeasible\none. In this case, the smooth changes seen in the objective va lue could be due to inconsistencies\nin the computed solutions, due to scaling issues, choices of stopping tolerances for the solvers,\nquadprog and its parameters, inaccuracy in the computation of the zer os spectral value abscissa,\nhigh sensitivity of the functions to the variables near mini mizers, etc. On the other hand, given\nthat the zeros spectral value abscissa is likely not Lipschi tz, and thus neither solver would have\nconvergence guarantees, the smoothly-varyingobjective v alueplots may simply bean indicator that\nthesolvers aresimply terminating beforeactually reachin g stationary points. In this case, it may be\nthat there are multiple stationary points present (even tho ugh they were not detected in Figures 1a\nand 1b). Unfortunately, it is diﬃcult to determine which of t he many possible combinations of\nexplanations is correct.\n5 A comparison using Relative Minimization Proﬁles\nThe preceding analysis comparing SQP-GS and GRANSO has so fa r only considered the quality of\nthe best answers they produced. Neither Figure 1a or 1b takes into account how much computation\nwas actually necessary to obtain these best solutions. For a ssessing the relative overall eﬃciency\nand speed of progress of these two methods, when computation is not an unlimited resource, we will\nemploy what are called β-relative minimization proﬁles (β-RMPs or RMPs), new benchmarking\nvisualization tools ﬁrst introduced in [Mit14, Section 7.5 ] and then more formally presented in\n[CMO17, Section 5]. To aid the reader who may not be familiar w ith these tools, we will ﬁrst\nprovide the prerequisite description of β-RMPs; for brevity, we only provide a high-level overview\n12suﬃcient for understanding our comparisons done here and re fer to [CMO17, Section 5] for the\nformal mathematical description of β-RMPs and further notes on their usage. Following that, we\nwill then describe how we tailor the RMP benchmark for the pur poses of our comparison (since\nRMPs can be considered more of a methodology, not just a singl e ﬁxed speciﬁcation) and then\npresent our numerical evaluation of SQP-GS and GRANSO.\n5.1 An RMP primer\nRMPs are typically presented as a small selection of related plots, say four, called a β-RMP bench-\nmark panel , that simultaneously compares methods in terms of amount of minimization achieved,\nability to ﬁnd feasible solutions, and speed of progress. Ea ch particular RMP plot in the selection\nis deﬁned for its own value of parameter β, which must be positive and scales the computational\nbudget allowed per each problem in a given test set. Individu al budgets may be assigned to each\nproblem diﬀerently (for example, to account for its relative diﬃculty, size, etc). Then, these budget\nassignments are scaled by the choices of βto determine the actual budgets for a speciﬁc proﬁle;\nthe set of such RMPs are referred to as β-RMPs.\nWhenβ=∞, the corresponding ∞-RMP compares methods without any regard to their\nrespective computational costs. Each method has its own ∞-RMP curve on the∞-RMP plot\nand for a given point ( x,y) on such a curve, yis thepercentage of problems solved such that the\nsolutions computed by this method were both feasible (to tol erances) and the relative diﬀerences\nof the corresponding objective values to the best known objective values (smallest and obtained on\nthe feasible region) were at most xfor each problem. On the right side of the ∞-RMP, typically\nx=∞is shown, which gives the percentage of problems that a metho d was able to ﬁnd feasible\nsolutions for, regardless of their corresponding objectiv e values (since x=∞means that there is\nno limit on what is an acceptably small relative diﬀerence). T he left side of the ∞-RMP, say for\nx= 10−16, instead gives the percentage of problems that a method foun d solutions that were both\nfeasible and agreed to the best known objective values (agai n, over the feasible set) to essentially\nmachine precision. Thus, the ∞-RMP curve for each method shows exactly how the percentage\nof itsacceptably solved problems increases as the relative diﬀerence tolerance xisloosened from\nmachine precision to ∞.\nWhenβis a ﬁnite positive value, the corresponding β-RMP compares methods when a per-\nproblem computational budget, scaled by β, is forced upon them. Thus, instead of being compared\nwith respect to their best computed answers, they are compar ed with respect to the best answers\nthey were able to ﬁnd within some given per-problem budgets, scaled by β. When β= 1, the\nper-problem budgets are not scaled and the methods are judge d with respect to however the per-\nproblem budgets are speciﬁed. As βis increased, the allowable computational budgets per prob lem\nis increased, giving each method more computation resource s (perhaps measured in wall-clock time,\nnumber of iterations, number of function evaluations, etc) for a chance to improve upon their best\nknown answers so far.\nThere is no prescribed choice or methodology for specifying the computational budgets used\ninβ-RMPs. Instead, the per-problem budgets are allowed to be de ﬁned in any way the user\nwishes, as diﬀerent budget choices may reﬂect diﬀerent goals o f the benchmark. Several example\nchoices and their possible respective usage cases were disc ussed in [CMO17, Sections 5.2 and 5.3],\nwhen introducing the formal description of β-RMPs. For example, budgets could be speciﬁed a\npriori by the user, which may be appropriate if the user has ei ther known limited computational\nresources or good estimates for the diﬃculties of each probl em in the test set. Alternatively,\nthe per-problem budgets can be constructed using data colle cted from the evaluation itself. In a\nmulti-way comparison, one might use the average or median of the runtimes of each method for a\n13given problem as the budget for that problem, as this may be a g ood estimate of that problem’s\ndiﬃculty. Another viable choice is to use the runtime per pro blem of a single method, which can\nbe appropriate when one, for example, is a benchmarking a new method against existing others\n(and as was done in the evaluation of GRANSO [CMO17, Section 6 ]).\nThe best known objective values used by the RMPs, called the target values , can also be\ndetermined in multiple ways. If the problems are convex and t he global minimizers are known,\nthen the globally minimal objective values could be supplie d directly by the user. For nonconvex\nproblems, minima may not be known and the methods may converg e to diﬀerent stationary points,\norperhapsnottoany(e.g. iftheproblemsarenotLipschitz) . Assuch, RMPssetthetarget valuefor\na problem to the best (smallest) objective value encountere d at a feasible point (to tolerances), by\nany of the methods, at any iterate in their entire iteration h istories, for the given problem. RMPs\nalso give the user the choice of deﬁning these target values b y restricting the pool of candidate\niterates to consider to be those that are computed within βtimes the allotted budget for that\nproblem; this feature is called target scaling and alters the target values to be the best known\nobjective values so far. Enabling target scaling typically increases the separati on of the diﬀerent\nRMP curves for each method in each particular β-RMP plot (which can aid in the visualization)\nand judgesthemethods with respect to results that are known to beachievable within the particular\nbudgets given for that β-RMP plot .\nTo produce a β-RMP benchmark panel, it is necessary to collect several pie ces of information.\nFor each method-problem pair, one must collect a history of i terates. The history must track the\nobjective values, constraints values, and the computation al cost (in whatever metric one has chosen\nto use) needed to obtain each iterate by that method. Note tha t the violation values can be used\nin lieu of constraint values but then one must take care the vi olation values across methods are\ncomputed in identical ways. A second of beneﬁt of collecting the constraint values is that it allows\nthe deﬁnition of acceptably feasible to be easily changed wi thout having to rerun the experiments.\nIt is worth noting that the objective values do not necessari ly need to be the values of the objective\nfunction of (1.1); using a measure of stationarity is also a p erfectly ﬁne “objective” value to track.\n5.2 Our β-RMP benchmark\nTo create our β-RMP benchmark, we recorded the objective and constraint fu nction trajectories\nof the methods for every starting point. For the elapsed time to obtain each iterate, we simply\nrecorded thetotal runningtime andthen usedtheaverage ela psed time periteration to estimate the\ncumulative elapsed time, as recommended by documentation o f the open-source betaRMP software\nfor making β-RMPs [Mita].\nSince we have evaluated SQP-GS and GRANSO on a single test pro blem, but one initialized\nfrom many diﬀerent points, we instead speciﬁed budgets and ta rget values a bit diﬀerently than\nwhat would be done in a RMP benchmark over a heterogenous set o f test problems. First, we chose\na single ﬁxed budget value (to bescaled by β) for each starting point, since initialization technicall y\ndoes not change the underlying optimization problem. For th is, we set the ﬁxed budget value as the\nmedian of the GRANSO runningtimes over the LC points (about 2 5.6 seconds), as these GRANSO\nLC runs were, on average, signiﬁcantly shorter than the time s of GRANSO on the randnpoints or\nSQP-GS on either set. Second, we forwent the use of target "}

From the\nconstructions in [9, 10], Proposition 3.3 below suggests th at a subsolution ¯ u\nshould satisfy a condition ¯ ut∈divR(D¯u) for a smaller set R(p) contained\nin Σ(p).\n2.Compensated compactness: Proof of Theorem 1.2\nLetN≥1 andGbe a bounded domain in RN.Given a vector function\nU= (U1,...,UN)∈L2(G;RN),let\nDivU=N/summationdisplay\nk=1∂Uk\n∂yk,CurlU= (∂Uk\n∂yl−∂Ul\n∂yk)1≤k,l≤N.\nThen DivU∈H−1(G) and Curl U∈H−1(G;MN×N) are well-deﬁned,\nwhereMN×Nis the space of all N×Nmatrices.\nWe need the following compensated compactness result known as the div-\ncurl lemma [15].\nLemma 2.1 (div-curl lemma) .LetVj, Wj∈L2(G;RN)satisfyVj⇀\nV∗, Wj⇀ W∗weakly inL2(G;RN). Assume DivVjandCurlWjcon-\nverge strongly in H−1(G)andH−1(G;MN×N),respectively.

Letujbe an approximating sequence of (1 .1)\ninH1(ΩT) such that ujconverges weakly to u∗inH1(ΩT).By selecting a\nsubsequence if necessary, we assume that uj→u∗strongly in L2(ΩT) and\nσ(Duj)⇀¯σweakly inL2(ΩT;Rn).\nClearly,u∗\nt= div¯σinH−1(ΩT).ON WEAK CLOSURE OF SOME DIFFUSION EQUATIONS 5\nAs above, let g(p,β) be the convex hull of |σ(p)−β|2.Then\n(2.1) 0 ≤g(p,β)≤c1(|p|2+|β|2+1)∀(p,β)∈Rn×Rn.\nSinceg(Duj,σ(Duj)) = 0, by convexity and (2.1), we have\n0≤/integraldisplay\nΩTg(Du∗(x,t),¯σ(x,t))dxdt≤liminf\nj→∞/integraldisplay\nΩTg(Duj,σ(Duj)) = 0;\nhence,g(Du∗(x,t),¯σ(x,t)) = 0 and\n¯σ(x,t)∈Z(Du∗(x,t))a.e.ΩT.\nLetVj= (σ(Duj),−uj) andWj= (Duj,uj\nt) be functions in L2(ΩT;Rn+1).\nThenVj⇀ V∗= (¯σ,−u∗) andWj⇀ W∗= (Du∗,u∗\nt) both weakly\ninL2(ΩT;Rn+1). Moreover, Div Vj= divσ(Duj)−uj\nt→0 strongly in\nH−1(ΩT) and CurlWj= 0 inH−1(ΩT;M(n+1)×(n+1)).Hence, by the div-\ncurl lemma, it follows that Vj·Wj⇀V∗·W∗in the sense of distributions\non ΩT; that is,\nlim\nj→∞/integraldisplay\nΩTφVj·Wjdxdt=/integraldisplay\nΩTφV∗·W∗dxdt∀φ∈C∞\n0(ΩT).\nSinceVj·Wj=σ(Duj)·Duj−ujuj\ntandV∗·W∗= ¯σ·Du∗−u∗u∗\nt,we thus\nobtain\n(2.2) lim\nj→∞/integraldisplay\nΩTφσ(Duj)·Dujdxdt=/integraldisplay\nΩTφ¯σ·Du∗dxdt∀φ∈C∞\n0(ΩT).\nFrom (2.2), we have, for all q∈Rnandφ∈C∞\n0(ΩT),\nlim\nj→∞/integraldisplay\nΩTφ(σ(Duj)−σ(q))·(Duj−q)dxdt=/integraldisplay\nΩTφ(¯σ−σ(q))·(Du∗−q)dxdt.\nLetq∈Λ; then, for all φ∈C∞\n0(ΩT) withφ≥0, we have\n/integraldisplay\nΩTφ(¯σ−σ(q))·(Du∗−q)dxdt≥0.\nThis implies that (¯ σ−σ(q))·(Du∗−q)≥0 almost everywhere in Ω T, which\nis true for all q∈Λ, and hence we have\n¯σ(x,t)∈Γ(Du∗(x,t))a.e.ΩT.\nTherefore, ¯σ(x,t)∈Σ(Du∗(x,t)) almost everywhere inΩ Tandu∗\nt= div¯σ\ninH−1(ΩT).

One has that f#(ω,ξ) =g(p,β) + (s−trB)2,where\ng(p,β)is the convex hull of |σ(p)−β|2onRn×Rn.\nProof.Givenζ= (φ,ψ)∈C∞\n0(Q;R1+n),we have\nf(ω,ξ+∇ζ) =|β+ψt−σ(p+Dφ)|2+(s−trB)2−2(s−trB)(divψ)+(divψ)2,\nand hencef#(ω,ξ) = ˜g(p,β)+(s−trB)2,where\n˜g(p,β) = inf\n(φ,ψ)∈C∞\n0(Q;R1+n)1\n|Q|/integraldisplay\nQ/parenleftBig\n|β+ψt−σ(p+Dφ)|2+(divψ)2/parenrightBig\ndxdt.\nClearly, ˜g(p,β)≤ |σ(p)−β|2.\nLetρǫ(ξ) = ˜ρǫ(|ξ|) be a standard mollifying sequence on M(1+n)×(n+1)\nand letf#\nǫ(ω,·) =f#(ω,·)∗ρǫ(·) be the smoothing sequence of f#.Since\nf#(ω,ξ) is quasiconvex (and thus continuous) in ξ, it follows that f#\nǫ(ω,ξ)\nis quasiconvex and smooth in ξfor eachǫ>0.Writef#\nǫ=gǫ+hǫ, where\ngǫ= ˜g∗ρǫ=gǫ(p,β), hǫ= (s−trB)2∗ρǫ= (s−trB)2+cǫ\nwithcǫbeing a constant such that cǫ→0 asǫ→0+.\nFrom the quasiconvexity of f#\nǫ(ω,ξ) inξ, it follows that f#\nǫ(ω,ξ) is\nrank-one convex in ξ; see [2, 6]. Therefore, for each rank-one matrix η\ninM(1+n)×(n+1)of the form\nη=/parenleftbigg\n1\nα/parenrightbigg\n⊗/parenleftbigq1/parenrightbig\n=/parenleftbigg\nq1\nα⊗q α/parenrightbigg\n(q∈Rn, α∈Rn),8 MENGLAN LIAO, LIANZHANG BAO, AND BAISHENG YAN\nthe function l(t) =f#\nǫ(ω,ξ+tη) =gǫ(p+tq,β+tα)+(s−trB−tα·q)2+cǫ\nis a convex function of tonR.Hence\nl′′(0) = [(gǫ)pp(p,β)q]·q+2[(gǫ)pβ(p,β)α]·q+[(gǫ)ββ(p,β)α]·α+2(α·q)2≥0.\nIn this inequality, replace ( q,α) by (kq,kα) withk >0, cancelk2and let\nk→0.Then it follows that\n[(gǫ)pp(p,β)q]·q+2[(gǫ)pβ(p,β)α]·q+[(gǫ)ββ(p,β)α]·α≥0\nfor allp,β,q,α ∈Rn. This proves that gǫis convex on Rn×Rnfor each\nǫ>0; hence, ˜gis convex on Rn×Rn.\nFinally, ifh(p,β) is a convex function satisfying h(p,β)≤ |σ(p)−β|2for\nallp,β∈Rn,then, by Jensen’s inequality, for all ( φ,ψ)∈C∞\n0(Q;R1+n),\nh(p,β)≤1\n|Q|/integraldisplay\nQh(p+Dφ,β+ψt)dxdt≤1\n|Q|/integraldisplay\nQ|β+ψt−σ(p+Dφ)|2dxdt\n≤1\n|Q|/integraldisplay\nQ(|β+ψt−σ(p+Dφ)|2+(divψ)2)dxdt.\nHenceh(p,β)≤˜g(p,β); therefore, ˜ g(p,β) is the largest convex function\nbelow the function |σ(p)−β|2,and thus ˜g=g. /square\nRemark 3.1. Givenω∈R1+n, letRf(ω,·) be the rank-one convex hull of\nf(ω,·) onM(1+n)×(n+1)(see [6]); then, it can be shown that\nRf(ω,ξ) =h(p,β)+(s−trB)2\nfor some function h(p,β)≥g(p,β).Similarly as in the proof of Proposition\n3.2, it follows that his convex, and hence h=gand\nRf(ω,ξ) =f#(ω,ξ) =g(p,β)+(s−trB)2.\nTherefore, the rank-one convex hull of fdoes not produce more special\nfeatures than the quasiconvex hull of f.\nThe following result shows that some special structures in t he set Σ(p)\ndeﬁned above have a variational description; this result al so shows that the\nsubsolutions ¯ uused in [9, 10] automatically satisfy ¯ ut∈divΣ(D¯u).\nProposition 3.3. Forλ>0,let\n(3.6)gλ(p,β) = inf\n(φ,ψ)∈C∞\n0(Q;R1+n)\n/bardblDφ/bardblL2(Q)<λ,divψ=01\n|Q|/integraldisplay\nQ|β+ψt−σ(p+Dφ)|2dxdt.\nThen,β∈Σ(p)ifgλ(p,β) = 0.\nProof.Assumegλ(p,β) = 0. From the formula of g= ˜gin the proof of\nProposition 3.2, it follows that 0 ≤g≤gλ; henceβ∈Z(p).To proveβ∈\nΓ(p),let (φj,ψj)∈C∞\n0(Q;R1+n) be such that /ba∇dblDφj/ba∇dblL2(Q)<λ,divψj= 0,\nand\nlim\nj→∞/integraldisplay\nQ|β+ψj\nt−σ(p+Dφj)|2dxdt= 0.ON WEAK CLOSURE OF SOME DIFFUSION EQUATIONS 9\nLetηj=β+ψj\nt−σ(p+Dφj).Thenηj→0 inL2(Q).Letq∈Λ.Then\n(σ(p+Dφj)−σ(q))·(p+Dφj−q)≥0; hence\n(3.7)/integraldisplay\nQ(β+ψj\nt−ηj−σ(q))·(p+Dφj−q)dxdt≥0.\nSince /integraldisplay\nQψj\nt·Dφjdxdt=/integraldisplay\nQφj\ntdivψjdxdt= 0,\nηj→0 inL2(Q) and/ba∇dblDφj/ba∇dblL2(Q)< λ, in (3.7) letting j→ ∞, it follows\nthat\n(β−σ(q))·(p−q)≥0.\nHenceβ∈Γ(p); this completes the proof. /square\nProof of Theorem 1.3. Let ¯w= (¯u,¯v)∈H1(ΩT;R1+n) satisfy ¯u= div¯v\nand ¯vt∈Z(D¯u) almost everywhere on Ω T.

He gave an explicit formula that takes a Poisson bracket on Rk\nas input and produces a \\star product\", i.e. a noncommutative deformation of\nthe product on C1(Rk) as a formal power series in the deformation parameter\n~. He did so by constructing his \\formality morphism\"|an explicit homotopy\nequivalence between the di\u000berential graded Lie algebras of polyvector \felds and\nHochschild cochains on the a\u000ene space Rk.\nThe star product (and more generally, the formality morphism) is expressed\nas a sum over a suitable collection of graphs. Each graph \u0000 contributes a\nterm involving a di\u000berential operator de\fned by an elementary combinatorial\nprocedure. This operator is then weighted by a constant\nc\u0000:=Z\nCn;m!\u00002R (1)\nde\fned by integrating an explicit volume form !\u0000over a suitable moduli space\nCn;mof marked holomorphic disks. As explained by Cattaneo{Felder [20], Kont-\nsevich's formula can be interpreted as a perturbative expansion in an appropriate\ntopological string theory, which has the expressions (1) as its Feynman integrals.\nThe coe\u000ecients (1) are universal, in the sense that they are independent of\nthe Poisson bracket one seeks to quantize; hence one only needs to compute\neach integral once and remember its value in perpetuity. However, the integrals\nare notoriously di\u000ecult to evaluate, and their precise values remain unknown.\nThus, even with the aid of a computer, it has so far been impossible to calculate\nthe terms in the quantization formula explicitly beyond ~3for many of the most\nbasic examples of Poisson brackets, such as the simple \\log canonical\" bracket\nfx;yg=xy (2)\non the (x;y)-plane (so named because the logarithms u= logxandv= logy\nare canonical variables, i.e. fu;vg= 1).\nNevertheless, there are strong expectations about the arithmetic properties\nof the coe\u000ecients. In his 1999 paper [37], Kontsevich made a series of inspiring\nconjectures, based on connections with the theories of motives, and informed by\nTamarkin's independent construction of quantizations [55] via formality of the\nlittle disks operad. One of the important consequences of those conjectures is\nthat the integrals (1) should be expressible in terms of a much smaller collection\nof constants, which are better understood (but still quite mysterious):\nConjecture 1.1. The coe\u000ecients c\u0000can be expressed as Q[(2\u0019i)\u00001]-linear com-\nbinations of multiple zeta values.\n2We recall that a multiple zeta value (MZV) of weightnis a real number\nde\fned by a convergent sum of the form\n\u0010(n1;:::;nd) =X\n0<k1<\u0001\u0001\u0001<kd1\nkn1\n1\u0001\u0001\u0001knd\nd2R; (3)\nwheren1;:::;ndare positive integers such thatP\njnj=nandnd\u00152. Thus\nMZVs generalize the special values \u0010(n) of the Riemann zeta function.\nIn this paper, we develop a systematic theory of integration on the moduli\nspaces of marked disks via suitable algebras of polylogarithms, and prove Con-\njecture 1.1 as an application. In fact, we prove a stronger statement, which gives\nprecise control over the weights of the MZVs that appear at a given order in ~,\nand which bounds the denominators of the rational coe\u000ecients. In other words,\nafter accounting for natural normalization factors, we show that the coe\u000ecients\nof the linear combinations are actually integers. See Corollary 1.3 below for the\nprecise statement.\nOur approach applies not only to Kontsevich's original \\harmonic\" for-\nmality morphism, but also to the other known explicit formality morphisms,\nnamely the \\logarithmic\" formality morphism of Kontsevich/Alekseev{Rossi{\nTorossian{Willwacher [1, 37] and the \\interpolating\" formality morphism of\nRossi{Willwacher [48]. We treat them uniformly in this paper. Our approach\nalso applies with minimal modi\fcation to the integrals appearing in various ex-\ntensions of the formality morphism (e.g. [53, 62]), to the calculation of the coe\u000e-\ncients of the Alekseev{Torossian connection/associator [2, 29], and presumably\nalso to the calculation of correlation functions in other two-dimensional \feld\ntheories, although we have not made an e\u000bort to explicitly pursue these further\napplications here.\nPerhaps most importantly, our results are constructive. The proof gives an\ne\u000bective algorithm to calculate the integrals in terms of MZVs, which we have\nimplemented to obtain the \frst software for the symbolic calculation of the terms\nin the quantization formula. For instance, our software gives the following terms\nin the \\harmonic\" star product associated to the Poisson bracket (2), obtained\nby summing contributions from thousands of individual graphs:\nx?y =g(~)xy andy?x =g(\u0000~)xy;\nwhere\ng(~) = 1 +~\n2+~2\n24\u0000~3\n48\u0000~4\n1440+~5\n480+\u0012251\u0010(3)2\n2048\u00196\u000017\n184320\u0013\n~6+\u0001\u0001\u0001\nDespite the presence of the conjecturally irrational number \u0010(3)2=\u00196, this ex-\npression is consistent with the expected relation\nx?y =e~y?x;\nobtained by formally imposing the canonical commutation rule [ u;v] =~on\nthe logarithms u= logxandv= logy. A similar result holds for the other\n3formality morphisms mentioned above, although the exact expressions for g(~)\nare di\u000berent.\nOur software is open source and is freely available at the following URL:\nhttp://bitbucket.org/bpym/starproducts/\nIt includes a complete database of coe\u000ecients for the 50821 graphs that appear\nup to~6in the star product. The software can easily compute individual coe\u000e-\ncients at higher order in ~, but since the number of graphs grows factorially, the\ncomputation of the full star product becomes quite resource-intensive; already\nat~7there are more than a million graphs to consider.\nWe refer the reader to Section 6 for more information about this package,\nincluding a summary of numerous previously known properties of the coe\u000ecients\nc\u0000that we used to test our software implementation, and by extension our main\ntheorems. For the rest of the introduction, and indeed most of the paper, we\nfocus on the mathematics.\n1.2 Multiple zeta values\nTo give a precise statement of our results, we must \frst set some notation\nand recall some standard facts about MZVs; see e.g. the surveys [58, 63]. Let\nZ0=Zbe the ring of integers, let Z1=f0g, and forn\u00152, letZn\u001aRbe the\nZ-submodule generated by the MZVs of weight n, as de\fned in (3). We shall\nwork throughout with the Z-submodule\neZn:=Zn+ i\u0019Zn\u00001\n(2i\u0019)n\u001aC: (4)\nofnormalized MZVs of weight n. We write<eZnand=eZnfor the real and\nimaginary parts of eZn, so that\neZn=<eZn\bi=eZn\nasZ-submodules of C. Note the parity in (4): only even weight MZVs appear\nin<eZ, while only odd weight MZVs appear in =eZ.\nThanks to the shu\u000fe product on MZVs and Euler's identity ( i\u0019)2=\u00006\u0010(2),\nwe haveeZmeZn\u001aeZm+n. Meanwhile 12eZ1=1\n2Zand henceeZn\u001aeZn+1, so\nthat the union of these modules gives a \fltered subring\neZ:=[\nn\u00150eZn\u001aC:\nThere is an established upper bound on the rank of the Z-modulesZn, which\nis conjectured to be tight [56]. Using proven reduction formulae for MZVs from\n[8], one obtains a list of Z-module generators for eZnfor smalln; see Table 1\nbelow. For example, eZ2is generated by the number \u0000\u0010(2)=(2i\u0019)2= 1=24. We\nremark that these generators are conjectured, but not known, to be Q-linearly\n4independent (unless n\u00144). In particular, the known irrationality results for\nodd Riemann zeta values (e.g. [3, 6]) do not address relations with powers of\n\u0019, and to date the possibility eZ\u0012Q[i] has not been excluded. However, such\ntranscendence issues will not play any role in this paper.\nTable 1: Generators for the Z-moduleseZn=<eZ\bi=eZ\u001aCforn\u00146.\nn0 1 2 3 4 5 6\ngenerators for<eZ11\n21\n241\n481\n57601\n115201\n2903040;\u0010(3)2\n128\u00196\ngenerators for i=eZi\u0010(3)\n8\u00193i\u0010(3)\n16\u00193i\u0010(3)\n192\u00193;i\u0010(5)\n64\u00195i\u0010(3)\n384\u00193;i\u0010(5)\n128\u00195\nNote that the denominators in Table 1 grow rapidly with n. Indeed, using\nknown identities for MZVs, we show in Appendix A that1\n(n+1)!2eZn. This\narithmetic fact allows us to constrain the weight of certain period integrals\n(Lemma 2.11), which in turn plays a key role in establishing the main result.\n1.3 Statement of the main theorem\nForn;m2Z\u00150with 2n+m\u00152, letCn;mdenote the moduli space parametrizing\nisomorphism classes of compact complex disks with nmarked points in the\ninterior and m+ 1 marked points on the boundary. It is a real manifold of\ndimension 2 n+mthat is a classifying space for the pure braid group on n\nstrands; see Section 4 for details. Any cross ratio of marked points and their\ncomplex conjugates gives a function f:Cn;m!C, and we consider the subring\nof di\u000berential forms\nA\u000f(Cn;m):=Z\u001cdf\n2i\u0019f\f\f\f\ffis a cross ratio\u001d\n\u001a\n\u000f(Cn;m)\ngenerated by the logarithmic di\u000berentials of cross ratios. Our main result is\nTheorem 1.2. Suppose!2A\u000f(Cn;m)is a volume form such that the integral\nI:=Z\nCn;m!\nconverges absolutely. Then we have\nI2(eZn\u00001ifm= 0and\neZn+m\u00002form> 0.\nUp to some conventional coe\u000ecients, the integrals appearing in the har-\nmonic, logarithmic, and interpolating formality morphisms are all of this type;\nsee Section 5. In particular, the integrals appearing at order ~nin the star\nproduct are integrals over Cn;2, which immediately implies the following:\n5Figure 1: A graph appearing at order ~8in the star product.\nCorollary 1.3. Suppose that \u0000is a graph appearing at order ~nin the star\nproduct, for some n\u00151. Then its coe\u000ecient c\u0000with respect to the known\nexplicit formality morphisms has the following form:\n\u000fFor the harmonic formality morphism,\nc\u000022\u00002n<eZ\u001aR:\n\u000fFor the logarithmic formality morphism,\nc\u00002eZn\u001aC:\n\u000fFor the interpolating formality morphism (depending on a parameter t),\nc\u00002eZ[t]\u001aC[t]\nis a polynomial in tof degree at most 2n\u00002whose coe\u000ecients are nor-\nmalized MZVs of weight at most n.\nThe interpolating formality morphism reduces to the harmonic and logarith-\nmic ones when t=1\n2andt= 0, respectively. Hence the \frst two statements in\nCorollary 1.3 follow from the third.\nIn particular, for the original harmonic formality morphism of Kontsevich,\nwe see that only even weight MZVs can occur, and moreover that the coe\u000ecients\nappearing at order ~nforn\u00145 are all rational. However, as we saw in the\nexample (2) above, one can \fnd conjecturally irrational coe\u000ecients in the star\nproduct at order ~6and beyond, even after summing up the contributions from\nall of the individual graphs.\nLet us remark that it is not clear from our theorem which MZVs will appear\nin the coe\u000ecient of a given graph. For example, consider the graph shown in\nFigure 1. Our software gives the following value of its coe\u000ecient c\u00002eZ[t] in\nthe interpolating formality morphism:\nc\u0000=5040 + 25059 \u001c\u000023887\u001c2\n870912000+\u001c(51 + 316\u001c)\u0010(3)\u0010(5)\n512\u00198+ 3\u001c(81 + 232\u001c)\u0010(3;5)\n2560\u00198\n+ i(1\u00002t)\u001c\u0010\n10240(1 + 168 \u001c)\u0010(3)\n\u00193\u0000(59 + 687\u001c)\u0010(5)\n3072\u00195+ 3(247 + 495 \u001c)\u0010(7)\n\u00197\u0011\n6where\u001c=t(1\u0000t). Note that no rational multiples of\u0010(3)2\n\u00196appear, although\nthey are allowed by our theorem and conjecturally independent from the other\nMZVs in this expression. When t2Qis generic (including the harmonic case\nt=1\n2) the expression above is conjecturally irrational, but for the logarithmic\nformality morphism ( t= 0), all of the MZVs drop out and we are left with a\nrational number:\nc\u0000jt=0=1\n172800:\nOn the other hand, there are graphs where the opposite behaviour occurs,\ne.g. the harmonic formality coe\u000ecient is zero while the logarithmic one involves\nnontrivial MZVs. Indeed, rationality is far from the expected generic behaviour\nfor the coe\u000ecients of the logarithmic formality morphism. In fact, we conjecture\nthat Corollary 1.3 is sharp in that case:\nConjecture 1.4. The integrals appearing at order ~nin the logarithmic star\nproduct generate eZnas aZ-module.\nWe have veri\fed this conjecture using our software for n\u00149. As further\nevidence for the conjecture, let us recall that there is a canonical equivalence\nbetween the set of homotopy classes of formality morphisms and the set of\nDrinfeld associators [27, 59, 61], as torsors over the Grothendieck{Teichm uller\ngroup. Under this equivalence, the logarithmic formality morphism corresponds\nto the Knizhnik{Zamolodchikov associator, which is the generating series for\nMZVs. Note, however, that for a given formality morphism, knowledge of the\ncoe\u000ecients of the corresponding associator does not imply any arithmetic infor-\nmation about the formality morphism itself or its associated star product|only\nthe homotopy class.\n1.4 Outline of the proof and layout of the paper\nThe proof of Theorem 1.2 rests on the development of a suitable function theory\non the moduli space of marked disks that facilitates the integration of di\u000berential\nforms. To develop this theory we relate the problem to a more familiar setting\nin the theory of period integrals: polylogarithms on the moduli space of genus\nzero curves, as studied by Brown [16] and Goncharov [32].\nThe basic observation is that a marked disk Dcan be \\doubled\" by gluing\nit to its complex conjugate along the boundary, yielding a genus zero curve\nX=D[@DD\u0018=P1. In the process, each marked point in @Dmaps to a unique\nmarked point in Xwhile the interior marked points in Dproduce pairs of marked\npoints in Xthat are interchanged by complex conjugation. In this way we obtain\nan embedding\nCn;m,!MN\nwhere MN=M0;N+1(C) denotes the moduli space of smooth complex curves\nof genus zero with N+1 marked points, where N= 2n+m. The forms on Cn;m\nwe wish to integrate are then given by the restriction of holomorphic forms on\n7MN. We can view Cn;mas a connected component of the \fxed point set of\nan antiholomorphic involution on MN, as studied by Ceyhan [21, 22], i.e. Cn;m\nis a component of the real locus for a real structure on MN. Forn > 0, this\nreal structure is di\u000berent from the standard one obtained by viewing MNas a\nscheme over Spec(Z).\nIn the case n= 0, our theorem reduces to the study of integrals over a cell\nC0;m\u001aMNin the standard real locus, whose relation with MZVs was treated\nin the seminal work [16] of Brown (with Q-coe\u000ecients); see also [9, 17, 11].\nBrown constructed a natural sheaf of di\u000berential forms on MNwhose coe\u000e-\ncient functions are certain multivalued transcendental functions|the \\multiple\npolylogarithms\". The closure of C0;min the Deligne{Knudsen{Mumford (DKM)\ncompacti\fcation MNis a manifold with corners (a copy of the Stashe\u000b associa-\nhedron), and Brown describes an inductive algorithm in which Stokes' theorem\nis applied in the algebra of polylogarithmic forms to reduce the problem to\nintegration over boundary strata of successively smaller dimension, eventually\nreducing the integral to special values of polylogarithms at points, which give\nMZVs. A key achievement in Brown's work is to explain how certain natural co-\nordinates on the standard real locus of the moduli space can be used to regulate\nthe divergences of polylogarithms along the boundary strata, so that Stokes'\ntheorem can be applied in spite of the apparent singularities.\nOur proof of Theorem 1.2 uses Brown's work in an essential way, but we\nalso introduce several new techniques in order to handle various complications\nin the geometry that have a nontrivial e\u000bect on the arithmetic properties of\nthe integrals. In particular, our result shows that when n > 0, the MZVs\nthat appear have a weight that is always strictly less than the dimension of the\nintegration cycle. Establishing this weight drop is one of the most subtle aspects\nof our argument; it involves a careful analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of\npolylogarithms on our integration cycles. We hope to give a motivic explanation\nfor this weight drop in future work.\nThe \frst di\u000eculty we encounter in the proof of Theorem 1.2 is that the nat-\nural dihedral coordinates used in Brown's logarithmic regularization scheme are\nill-adapted to our integration cycles. To overcome this, we describe an alterna-\ntive construction of the sheaf of polylogarithms in Section 2, which emphasizes\ntheir interpretation as periods of the fundamental groupoid of the universal\ncurve (the numerical shadow of Goncharov's motivic polylogarithms [32]). This\nallows us to give an exposition that reduces the explicit dependence on coordi-\nnates and base points and is therefore more readily applied to our cycles. The\nconstruction also allows us to work systematically with coe\u000ecients in Z, giving\nan integral lattice in Brown's Q-linear sheaf of polylogarithms.\nThe second challenge is that when n >1, the manifold Cn;mis not simply\nconnected, and hence polylogarithms on Cn;mmay have nontrivial monodromy.\nThis causes problems when we try to apply Stokes' theorem, which can only\nbe applied to di\u000berential forms that are globally de\fned (i.e. single-valued). To\novercome this, we establish in Section 3 some cohomological properties of the\nsheaf of polylogarithms. For any cycle \u0006\u001aMNthat is homotopy equivalent to\nan iterated \fbration by punctured disks in universal curves, we give a construc-\n8tive algebraic model for the polylogarithms that are single-valued on \u0006\u001aMN,\nand we establish the vanishing of the higher sheaf cohomology along the \fbres;\nsee Theorem 3.12.\nIn Section 4, we apply these developments to the case \u0006=Cn;m. Our main\ntechnical result (Theorem 4.1) describes the functorial behaviour of polyloga-\nrithms along the natural projections\nf:Cn0;m0!Cn;m\nthat forget a collection of marked points, which we summarize as follows.\nThe di\u000berential forms with polylogarithmic coe\u000ecients give a complex of lo-\ncally constant subsheaves ( U\u000f\nn;m;d)\u001a(\n\u000f\nCn;m;d) in the de Rham complex. This\ncomplex comes equipped with a canonical increasing weight \fltration W\u000fU\u000f\nn;m.\nThe constants in U0\nn;mare exactly the normalized MZVs and a version of the\nPoincar\u0013 e lemma states that the inclusion of the constant sheaf eZ,!U\u000f\nn;mis a\nquasi-isomorphism of \fltered sheaves. Using the results of Section 3, we show\nthat these sheaves are acyclic along the \fbres of any projection f, and hence by\ntaking hypercohomology of ( U\u000f\nn;m;d) we obtain an arithmetic re\fnement of the\nclassical de Rham isomorphism.\nSince the top-degree cohomology of the \fbres vanishes, this re\fned de Rham\nisomorphism implies, in particular, that \fbrewise polylogarithmic volume forms\nalways have polylogarithmic primitives that are single-valued along the \fbres.\nHence for a global polylogarithmic form\n!2U\u000f(Cn0;m0):=\u0000\u0000\nCn0;m0;U\u000f\nn0;m0\u0001\nwe may apply Stokes' theorem to compute the pushforward f\u0003!2\n\u000f(Cn;m),\nde\fned by integrating !over the \fbres (provided that these integrals converge).\nHowever, the primitive may have singularities on the boundary that require a\nmore general regularization scheme than the ones developed in [1, 16]. This\ncould in principle be done globally on the \fbres for any projection f, but since\nthe pushforward is functorial, it is actually su\u000ecient to treat the simplest cases,\nin which a single marked point is forgotten. A careful analysis of the asymptotics\nin this case allows us to calculate the integrals using contour deformation and\na suitable residue theorem, giving the following:\nTheorem. (see Theorem 4.1) If !2WjU\u000f(Cn0;m0)is such that the \fbre inte-\ngrals de\fning the pushforward f\u0003!converge absolutely, then\nf\u0003!2Wj\u0000kU\u000f(Cn;m);\nwhere the weight of the form has dropped by\nk=(\nn0\u0000n+ 1m= 0andm0>0\nn0\u0000n otherwise:\nTheorem 1.2 above then follows easily by taking fto be the projection to\na point; see Corollary 4.2. With the general theory in place, we explain in\n9Section 5 how to apply the theory to the Feynman integrals (1) appearing in\nthe formality morphism. (This is simply a matter of recalling the de\fnitions.)\nWe also give a detailed example that illustrates how our algorithm works in\npractice. We close the main body of the paper in Section 6 with an overview of\nour software package. Finally, the appendices contain proofs of some elementary\nfacts about polylogarithms and MZVs that are needed to establish our result\nwithZ-coe\u000ecients but which we felt might distract from the core narrative of\nthe paper.\nIn closing, let us remark that our approach to the \fbre integration is very\nmuch inspired by Schnetz' method of \\single-valued integration\", introduced\nin his study of graphical functions in \u001e4theory [51]. There he gives a residue\ntheorem for calculating volume integrals of two-forms on P1whose coe\u000ecients\nlie in Brown's algebra [14, 15] of univariate single-valued polylogarithms. The\nworks [13, 26, 49, 54] build on this idea to study volume integrals over MNitself,\nwith applications to superstring amplitudes. Note however, that such integrals\ngive rise to a restricted class of MZVs (the \\single-valued MZVs\", see [12]) which\nexclude, for example, the generator \u0010(3;5)2Z8that appears in our work. This\ndi\u000berence stems from the subtle contributions made by the boundaries of disks in\nour setting. Our cohomological viewpoint on the cancellation of monodromy in\nthe single-valued integration process seems to be new, and it is straightforward\nto apply it in other settings, including the volume integrals on MNstudied in\nop. cit. (see, e.g. Example 3.15 below).\nAcknowledgements: We thank Anton Alekseev, Francis Brown, Ricardo\nBuring, Damien Calaque, Ricardo Campos, Pierre Cartier, Cl\u0013 ement Dupont, Li-\nonel Mason, Sergei Merkulov, Maxim Kontsevich, Oliver Schnetz, Pavol \u0014Severa,\nThomas Willwacher and Federico Zerbini for their interest in our work, and for\nhelpful conversations and correspondence.

The elements of\nS1are called marked points and we will typically not distinguish them from\ntheir image in X. We denote by\nX\u000e\nS:=XnS1\nthe punctured curve obtained by removing all of the marked points.\nFor every pair q;r2Sof distinct marked points there is a unique isomor-\nphism from Xto the complex projective line P1that sends ( r;q;1) to (0;1;1).\nIt maps a point p2Xto the cross ratio ( p;q;r;1) de\fned by\n(p;q;r;s):=(p\u0000r)(q\u0000s)\n(p\u0000s)(q\u0000r)2P1; (5)\nand this identi\fes Swith a subset of Ccontainingf0;1g, so that X\u000e\nS\u0018=CnS.\nIn this way we obtain a global holomorphic coordinate zonX\u000e\nS. We call such a\ncoordinate chart admissible .\n2.1.2 Tangential base points and the fundamental groupoid\nIf we \fx an admissible identi\fcation z:X!P1, we may equip an S-marked\ncurve XSwith a collection of non-zero tangent vectors at marked points, called\nitstangential base points , as follows. At every \fnite marked point s2S,\nwe take the two unit vectors \u0006@z. At the in\fnite marked point 1, we take the\nunit tangent vectors \u0006@win the coordinate w=z\u00001. We will often denote a\ntangential base point at some s2S1by the symbol ~ s.\nExample 2.1.SupposejSj= 2. Then X\u000e\nScan be identi\fed with P1nf0;1;1g. We\nget six tangential base points overall, and they form a torsor for the symmetric\ngroup Aut(X\u000e\nS)\u0018=S3which permutes the marked points f0;1;1g.\nSuppose that ~ sis a tangential base point on XS. Apath starting from ~ sis\na smooth path \r: [0;1]!Xsuch that\r0(0) =~ sand\r(t) lies in the punctured\ncurve X\u000e\nSwhent >0. Similarly, we may speak of paths that end at ~ s, where\nthey have \fnal velocity \r0(1) =\u0000~ s, or paths which start and end at tangential\nbase points (but otherwise lie in X\u000e\nS).\nThere is an obvious notion of homotopy between such paths, and the homo-\ntopy classes have a natural composition. The resulting fundamental groupoid\n\u00051(XS) =fpaths between tangential base points g\nfhomotopies that \fx tangential base points g\nis \fnitely generated, e.g. by a collection of loops around each marked point\ns2Stogether with a collection of paths that connects all of the tangential\nbase points. The group of loops based at any \fxed tangential base point ~ sis\nisomorphic to the fundamental group of the punctured curve X\u000e\nS.\n11Remark 2.2.Our de\fnition of \u0005 1(XS) depends on the choice of an admissible\ncoordinatez:X\u0018=P1, but below we will use \u0005 1(XS) to de\fne algebras of periods\nand hyperlogarithms that will turn out to be independent of this choice.\n2.1.3 Regularized limits\nLet XSbe anS-marked curve with a tangential base point ~ s.

If \u000b1has no pole at \r(1) and\u000bnhas no pole at \r(0),\nthen this reduces to the ordinary iterated integral, which converges absolutely\n13in this case and is independent of the choice of tangent vectors at \r(0) and\r(1).\nThis follows from [31, Proposition 2.14] or [45, Lemma 3.3.16].\nLet us give some examples of regularization in the simplest case n= 1, where\niterated integrals are just ordinary integrals:\nExample 2.3.Suppose that p;q;r;s2S1are four distinct marked points and\n\rdenotes any path from ptoq. In any admissible coordinate z, the integral\nZ\n\r(s\u0000r) =Z\n\r[!s\u0000!r] =log(z\u0000s)\u0000log(z\u0000r)\n2i\u0019\f\f\f\fz=q\nz=p=log (p;q;r;s)\n2i\u0019(9)\nis absolutely convergent and determines a branch of the logarithm of the cross\nratio. The branch depends on the homotopy class of \r, and a change in homo-\ntopy class shifts the expression (9) by an integer.\nExample 2.4.The di\u000berential form !shas a pole at s, and hence its integral\nalong a path \rfrom~ stoq2Snfsgrequires regularization. Let us identify X\nwithP1by choosing an admissible chart zsuch that~ s=@z. We then calculate\nZ\n\r[!s] =\u0010\nRlim\nz!q\u0000Rlim\nz!s\u0011log(z\u0000s)\n2i\u0019=log(q\u0000s)\n2i\u0019(10)\nwhere once again the branch of the logarithm is determined by the homotopy\nclass of\r. Observe that since\nlog(q\u0000s) = log(q;1;s;1) + log(1;1;s;0);\nthe integral (10) can also be expressed in terms of cross ratios.\nExample 2.5.In a similar vein, consider a path \rthat starts at a tangential\nbase point~ sand wraps around s, traversing a total angle n\u0019before returning\ntosalong the tangent vector ( \u00001)n~ s. The regularized integral\nZ\n\r[!s] =ni\u0019\n2i\u0019=n\n221\n2Z\nmeasures the change in log( z\u0000s) along\r, which is i\u0019for each half-loop.\nBecause regularized iterated integration along a path \ris de\fned for an\narbitrary word in the forms A1(XS), we can view it as a Z-linear map\nZ\n\r:ZhSi\u0000!C:\nIt has the following important properties [40, 31]:\n1. For any two words u;v2ZhSi, we have\n\u0012Z\n\ru\u0013\n\u0001\u0012Z\n\rv\u0013\n=Z\n\r(u \u0001v); (11)\nwhere \u0001:ZhSi\nZhSi!ZhSiis the commutative shu\u000fe product.\n142.

If\ris an identity element of \u0005 1(XS), i.e. a contractible loop based at some\ntangential base point, then\nZ\n\rZS>0= 0: (14)\nIf one or both ends of a path \ris at a tangential base point, the regularized\niterated integral along \rcan be computed algorithmically using the principle of\nshu\u000fe regularization , as follows. We explain the case of a path \r2\u00051(XS)\nfrom a tangential base point ~ pto another tangential base point ~ q; the case in\nwhich one end lies in X\u000e\nSis treated similarly.\nLet us choose forms \u000bp;\u000bq2A1(XS) that are dual to simple loops around\npandq, i.e.\u0012Resq\u000bqResp\u000bq\nResq\u000bpResp\u000bp\u0013\n=1\n2i\u0019\u00121 0\n0 1\u0013\n:\nThus ifp;q2Swe may simply take \u000bq=!qand\u000bp=!p, whereas if q=1, we\nmay choose an additional marked point r6=p;qarbitrarily and take \u000bq=\u0000!r\nand\u000bp=!p\u0000!r. Then every element v2ZSncan be written uniquely in the\nform\nv=X\nj+k\u0014n\u000bj\nq \u0001vjk \u0001\u000bk\np (15)\nwherevjk2ZSn\u0000j\u0000kis a linear combination of tensor monomials that start\nwith a form that is smooth at qand end with a form that is smooth p.

In this way we reduce the calculation to\nconvergent iterated integrals, and regularized logarithms. The latter can then\nbe evaluated directly as in Example 2.4 and Example 2.5 above.\n152.2 Periods of marked curves\nDe\fnition 2.6. Let XSbe anS-marked curve. The ring of periods of XS\nis the subring\nP=P(XS):=*Z\n\u00051(XS)ZhSi+\n\u001aC (17)\ngenerated by iterated integrals between pairs of tangential base points.\nFor everyn\u00150, there is a Z-submodule WnP\u001aPofperiods of weight n,\nspanned by monomialsQ\niR\n\riuiwhere the elements ui2ZSnihave total weightP\nini=n. By de\fnition, we have W0P=ZandWmP\u0001WnP\u001aWn+mP.\nBy Example 2.5, we have that 1 2W1P, and therefore WnP\u001aWn+1Pfor\nalln. Thus the ring Pis \fltered by the weight. It receives a homomorphism\nZ\n\r:ZhSi\u0000!P\nfor any path \r2\u00051(XS), where as above ZhSiis viewed as a commutative\nalgebra equipped with the shu\u000fe product. By the path concatenation and\ninversion formulae (12) and (13), the ring Pis generated by periodsR\n\ruwhere\n\ris drawn from a \fnite collection of paths that generate \u0005 1(XS). It follows\nthat eachWnPis aZ-module of \fnite rank.\nAll periods of weight one can be computed along the lines of Examples 2.3\nthrough 2.5 above, giving the following elementary description:\nLemma 2.7. TheZ-submodule W1P\u001aCis generated by1\n2and the numbers\nlog(c)\n2i\u0019, wherecruns over all possible cross ratios of marked points on XS.\nIn particular, we see that the Z-moduleW1Pdepends only on the isomor-\nphism class of XS, and not on the admissible chart used to de\fne the tangential\nbase points and the fundamental groupoid. It is also insensitive to the distinc-\ntion of the label1, and thus completely determined by the isomorphism class\nof the complex manifold X\u000e\nSwithout any reference to labels.\nBy shu\u000fe regularization (16), every period of higher weight is a polynomial\nin weight one periods and convergent iterated integrals. Since the latter are also\ninsensitive to the tangential base points, we have the following:\nLemma 2.8. The weight-\fltered ring P(XS)of periods depends only on the\nisomorphism class of the punctured curve X\u000e\nS.\nIfXSis a marked curve and S0\u001aS, let XS0be theS0-marked curve obtained\nfrom XSby forgetting all marked points in SnS0. Then we have an obvious\ninclusion P(XS0)\u001aP(XS). In particular, taking jS0j= 2, we see that the peri-\nods of any marked curve include the periods of the projective line P1equipped\nwith the marked points S0=f0;1gand1. It is well known that such periods\ncan be written in terms of MZVs, see [41]. More precisely, we have the following\n16Theorem 2.9. IfjSj= 2, then the periods of XSare exactly the normalized\nmultiple zeta values, that is, we have an equality of \fltered rings\nP(XS) =eZ\u001aC:\nProof. The result is standard when the coe\u000ecients are taken in Q, but a com-\nment is required because we work with integer coe\u000ecients.\nBy path concatenation, path inversion, and automorphisms of P1nf0;1;1g,\nwe can reduce every period to a polynomial in iterated integrals along two paths:\nthe straight line path dchfrom 0 to 1, and a half-loop at zero as in Example 2.5.\nThe convergent integrals along dchgive the MZVs [41, Proposition A.4]:\n\u0010(n1;:::;nd)\n(2i\u0019)n1+\u0001\u0001\u0001+nd=Z\ndch[!0j\u0001\u0001\u0001j!0j\u0000!1|{z}\nndj\u0001\u0001\u0001j!0j\u0001\u0001\u0001j!0j\u0000!1|{z}\nn1]2eZn1+\u0001\u0001\u0001+nd:\nHence by shu\u000fe regularization, it is enough to show that ( W1P)n=n!\u001aWnP.\nBut since there are only three marked points, there are no possible cross ratios,\nand henceW1P=1\n2Zby Lemma 2.7. Therefore\nWnP=nX\nk=01\n2kk!Zn\u0000k\n(2i\u0019)n\u0000k:\nIt remains to observe that 1 =(2kk!)2(Zk+ i\u0019Zk\u00001)=(2i\u0019)k, so that the sum\non the right collapses to the de\fnition (4) of eZ. This follows from the identity\n\u00192m\n(2m+ 1)!=\u0010(2;:::; 2|{z}\nmtimes); (18)\nwhich is due to Ho\u000bman [35, Corollary 2.3] and valid for all m\u00151.\nExample 2.10.The iterated integral of w= [!1j!0j!0j!1] along dchis divergent,\ndue to the singularityR1\u0000\u000f\n0[!1] = log\u000fproduced by the \frst letter. But since\nw= [!1] \u0001[!0j!0j!1]\u0000[!0j!1j!0j!1]\u00002[!0j!0j!1j!1]\nand the iterated integration respects the shu\u000fe product, we conclude that\nZ\ndchw=\u0010\nRlim\n\u000f!0log\u000f\u0011Z\ndch[!0j!0j!1]\u0000Z\ndch[!0j!1j!0j!1]\u00002Z\ndch[!0j!0j!1j!1]\n= 0\u0001\u0000\u0010(3)\n(2i\u0019)3\u0000\u0010(2;2)\n(2i\u0019)4\u00002\u0010(1;3)\n(2i\u0019)4=\u00001\n11522eZ4\nusing the identities \u0010(1;3) =1\n4\u0010(4),\u0010(2;2) =3\n4\u0010(4) and\u0010(4) =\u00194\n90as in [58].\nLater on, we will use the fact that periods of closed loops have lower weight:\n17Lemma 2.11. LetXSbe anyS-marked curve, and suppose that \r2\u00051(XS)is\na closed loop at some tangential base point of XS. Then for any word s1\u0001\u0001\u0001sn2\nZhSiof lengthn\u00151, we have\nZ\n\rs1\u0001\u0001\u0001sn2Wn\u00001P(XS):\nProof. The fundamental group based at ~ sis generated by paths of the form\n\r=\u0011\u00001?\u000e?\u0011 , where\u0011is a path from ~ sto some marked point p2Sand\u000e\nis a small loop around p. By virtue of the path concatenation and inversion\nformulas, it su\u000eces to consider the periods along such generators. By the path\nconcatenation formula, we have\nZ\n\rs1\u0001\u0001\u0001sn=X\n0\u0014j\u0014k\u0014nZ\n\u0011\u00001s1\u0001\u0001\u0001sjZ\n\u000esj+1\u0001\u0001\u0001skZ\n\u0011sk+1\u0001\u0001\u0001sn: (19)\nNote that the terms with j=k(i.e. with no integrals over \u000e) combine to give the\niterated integralR\n\u0011\u00001?\u0011s1\u0001\u0001\u0001sn, which vanishes since \u0011\u00001?\u0011is a contractible\nloop. Hence it is enough to show that each term with j <k has weight at most\nn\u00001. By a direct calculation (see e.g. [31, Lemma 2.5]), it follows that\nZ\n\u000esj+1\u0001\u0001\u0001sk=(\n1=(k\u0000j)! ifsj+1=\u0001\u0001\u0001=sk=pand\n0 otherwise.\nThis lies ineZ(k\u0000j)\u00001\u0012W(k\u0000j)\u00001P(XS) by Lemma A.1 in the appendix, and\nthe result follows.\nExample 2.12.Let us \fx a pair p;q2Sof distinct marked points, and an\nadditional marked point t2S. We compute the period\nI:=Z\n\rtqp\nwhere\rt2\u00051(XS) is a loop based at ~1whose homology class is dual to !t.\nFollowing the recipe in the proof of Lemma 2.7, we write \rt=\u0011\u00001?\u000e?\u0011 for\na path\u0011from~1to~tand a small loop \u000earoundt. The path concatenation\nexpansion then collapses to\nI=Z\n\u0011\u00001qZ\n\u000ep+Z\n\u000eqZ\n\u0011p=8\n><\n>:\u00001\n2i\u0019log(p\u0000q)t=p\n1\n2i\u0019log(q\u0000p)t=q\n0 t6=q;p\nwhere the branch of logarithm is determined by the homotopy class of \u0011(or\nequivalently, the homotopy class of \rt).\n182.3 Hyperlogarithms\nSuppose that XSis a marked curve and \ris a path from some tangential base\npoint~ pto a pointz2X\u000e\nSinside the punctured curve. As we vary z, the path\r\nlifts locally to a smooth family of paths \rzfrom~ ptoz. Every element v2ZhSi\ntherefore de\fnes a germ\nLv(z):=Z\n\rzv (20)\nof a holomorphic, multivalued function on X\u000e\nS. Such a function is called a\nhyperlogarithm [39, 40, 46].\nObserve that if e\ris another path to zstarting from some tangential base\npoint~ q, then we have e\r=\r?\u0018 for some path \u0018from~ qto~ p, and hence by the\npath concatenation formula, the corresponding hyperlogarithms are related by\n^Ls1\u0001\u0001\u0001sn=Ls1\u0001\u0001\u0001sn+Ls1\u0001\u0001\u0001sn\u00001\u0001Z\n\u0018sn+Ls1\u0001\u0001\u0001sn\u00002\u0001Z\n\u0018sn\u00001sn+\u0001\u0001\u0001 (21)\nThe coe\u000ecientsR\n\u0018sj\u0001\u0001\u0001sn2Pare periods of the curve XS. Therefore the P-\nlinear combinations of hyperlogarithms generate a canonically de\fned subsheaf\nL\u001aO X\u000e\nS\nof analytic functions on X\u000e\nS. It is a locally constant sheaf of algebras over the\nringPof periods. By de\fnition, any path \ras above de\fnes a surjective algebra\nhomomorphism to the stalk\nZ\n\r: (PhSi; \u0001)\u0000!Lz: (22)\nIn fact, this map is also injective [16, Corollary 5.6]:\nProposition 2.13. The map (22) is an isomorphism of P-algebras.\nNote that since Pis a \fltered ring, the free algebra PhSicarries two natural\n\fltrations. More precisely, let us consider the Z-submodule\nWk\nnPhSi:=X\nj\u0014kWn\u0000jP\u0001Sj\u001aPhSi\nconsisting of elements of total weight nthat involve monomials in the free alge-\nbra of length at most k. Using Proposition 2.13, we can transfer these \fltrations\nto the sheafL, giving locally constant subsheaves\nWk\nnL\u001aL\nsuch thatWk\nnL\u001aWk\nn+1L\\Wk+1\nnL. It follows from (21) that these \fltrations\nare independent of the path \rused to de\fne the isomorphism of PhSiwith the\n19stalks ofL. We refer to the \fltration W\u000fLandW\u000fLas the \fltrations by the\ntotal weight and the relative weight , respectively. We denote by\ngrL=M\nk\u00150WkL=Wk\u00001L\u0018=PhSi (23)\nthe constant sheaf obtained by taking the associated graded with respect to the\nrelative weight \fltration.\nThe monodromy of a hyperlogarithm is computed by (21) as the special case\nwhen\u0018is a closed loop based at ~ p=~ q. The weight drop for the corresponding\nperiods (Lemma 2.11) implies that the monodromy representation is unipotent\nwith respect to both \fltrations:\nLemma 2.14. IfL2Wk\nnLzis the germ of a hyperlogarithm at z2X\u000e\nS, then\nits analytic continuation \r\u0001Lalong a loop \r2\u00191(X\u000e\nS;z)has the form\n\r\u0001L\u0011LmodWk\u00001\nn\u00001Lz:\nIt follows immediately from the de\fnition (8) of iterated integrals that the\nde Rham di\u000berential acts on hyperlogarithms by\ndLs1\u0001\u0001\u0001sn=Ls2\u0001\u0001\u0001sn\u0001!s12L\nA1(XS) (24)\nso that we have a subcomplex\nU\u000f\nXS:=L\nA\u000f(XS)\u001a\n\u000f(X\u000e\nS)\nof the holomorphic de Rham complex of the punctured curve. It is \fltered by\nthe total and relative weights, where elements of A1(XS) are assigned weight\none. From (24) it is clear that the stalk complex of U\u000f\nXSat any point admits a\ncontracting homotopy de\fned on generators by\nLs1\u0001\u0001\u0001sn!s7!Lss1\u0001\u0001\u0001sn: (25)\nWe therefore have the following re\fnement of the Poincar\u0013 e lemma:\nLemma 2.15. The inclusion P,!U\u000f\nXSof the constants is a quasi-isomorphism\nof sheaves of \fltered di\u000berential graded algebras.\nHyperlogarithms based at a tangential base point ~ s=@zhave logarithmic\nsingularities at the punctures S1.

The main results in this\nsection are due to them, although our exposition di\u000bers. The primary technical\ndi\u000berence is that we work with coe\u000ecients in Zrather than Q, so we justify at\nsome points why this is possible.\n2.4.1 Moduli spaces and the universal curve\nLet us denote by MSthe moduli space parametrizing isomorphism classes of\nS-marked curves. Since the set of marked points is S1=S[f1g , this is\nan abbreviation for the standard notation M0;S1orM0;N, whereN=jSj+ 1.\nRecall that MSis a complex manifold of dimension jSj\u00002 and it comes equipped\nwith a universal family of marked curves\nXS!MS\nsuch that the \fbre XS;yover any point y2MSis a marked curve whose iso-\nmorphism class is y. We denote by X\u000e\nS\u001aXSthe universal punctured curve.\nIfS\u001aTis an inclusion of \fnite sets, there is a \fbration MT!MSde\fned\nby forgetting the marked points labelled by TnS. The \fbres have dimension\njTnSj. In particular ifjTj=jSj+ 1, then this \fbration is canonically identi\fed\nwith the universal punctured curve X\u000e\nS.\n2.4.2 Cross ratios and di\u000berential forms\nFor any quadruple i;j;k;l2S1of markings, the cross ratio of the corresponding\nmarked points gives a natural function\nf= (i;j;k;l) :MS\u0000!Cnf0;1g:\nIfT=Stfzgand we choose an embedding f0;1g,!Sthen the cross ratios of\nthe form (z;1; 0;1) give admissible charts on the \fbres of the universal curve\nXS\u001bMT!MS, and we obtain a trivialization\nXS\u0018=MS\u0002P1\nof the underlying \fbration, so that the marked points in XSare indicated by\nthe cross ratios ( s;1; 0;1) :MS!P1for eachs2S1.\nThe logarithmic di\u000berentials of cross ratios generate a subring we denote by\nA\u000f(MS):=\u001cdlogf\n2i\u0019\f\f\f\ffis a cross ratio\u001d\n\u001a\n\u000f(MS);\nwith the constants A0(MS):=Z\u001a\n0(MS).\nExample 2.16.IfjSj= 2, then MSis a point andA\u000f(MS) =Z.\n21Example 2.17.IfjSj= 3, any cross ratio z:MS!P1nf0;1;1gis an isomor-\nphism. The other \fve independent cross ratios can be expressed in terms of z\nasz\u00001;1\u0000z;(1\u0000z)\u00001;(z\u00001)z\u00001andz(z\u00001)\u00001, so that\nA1(MS) =Zdz\n2i\u0019z\bZdz\n2i\u0019(z\u00001)\nis theZ-module of forms on P1nf0;1;1gconsidered above.\nAs explained by Getzler [30, Section 3.8] and Brown [16, Section 6.1], Arnold's\ncalculation [5] of the cohomology of the planar con\fguration spaces implies that\nA\u000f(MS) projects isomorphically onto the integral cohomology ring of the moduli\nspace:\nA\u000f(MS)\u0018=H\u000f(MS;Z); (27)\nand this allows for the explicit presentation of A\u000f(MS) in terms of generators\nand relations (called Arnold's relations).\nIn particular, ifjTj=jSj+ 1 and we identify MTwith the universal punc-\ntured curve, then the restriction of an element \u000b2A1(MT) to a \fbre ygives\nan element \u000bjXS;y2A1(XS;y)\u0018=ZS. Done in families, this gives rise to an exact\nsequence\n0 //A1(MS) //A1(MT) //A1(XS) //0\nof free Z-modules, where A1(XS)\u0018=ZSis the natural Z-module of relative\ndi\u000berentials on the universal curve. A choice of splitting of this exact sequence\ngives an isomorphism of graded Z-modules\nA\u000f(MT)\u0018=A\u000f(MS)\nA\u000f(XS) (28)\nwhich one can use inductively to construct a basis for A\u000f(MS).\nMore generally, for an arbitrary projection f:MT!MSwe may de\fne the\nrelative di\u000berentials\nA\u000f(MT=MS) =A\u000f(MT)\nf\u0003A1(MS)^A\u000f(MT)\nand we obtain a non-canonical isomorphism\nA\u000f(MT)\u0018=A\u000f(MS)\nA\u000f(MT=MS) (29)\nofZ-modules that becomes canonical once we pass to the associated graded of\nthe usual \fbrewise Hodge \fltration\nFjA\u000f(MT) =f\u0003Aj(MS)^A\u000f(MT):\n2.4.3 Polylogarithms on moduli spaces\nGiven an embedding f0;1g,!S, we obtain an admissible chart on each \fbre\nof the universal curve XS, and the corresponding tangential base points give\n22global sections of the tangent bundle TXS. Since the \fbration is topologically\nlocally trivial, the fundamental groupoids of the \fbres assemble into a locally\nconstant sheaf \u0005 1(XS) of groupoids on MS. Given a local section \r2\u00051(XS)\nand an element v2ZhSi, we can compute the corresponding period integrals\nin the \fbres to obtain a holomorphic functionR\n\rvonMS.\nDe\fnition 2.18. Thesheaf of polylogarithms on MSis the subsheaf of\nrings\nVS:=*Z\n\u00051(XS)ZhSi+\n\u001aOMS\ngenerated by period integrals on the universal curve.\nThe sheavesVSare locally constant by analytic continuation and come\nequipped with an exhaustive increasing weight \fltration\nZ=W0VS\u001aW1VS\u001a\u0001\u0001\u0001\nde\fned as above for periods.

One can write all germs of higher weight as special functions\nknown as multiple polylogarithms [16, Section 5.4] but we will not need the\nexplicit details of this description. Note that while the construction of VSrelies\non a choice of labels f0;1g,!S, the same argument as in Lemma 2.8 shows\nthat the subsheaf VS\u001aOMSis, in fact, independent of this choice. Similarly,\nthe argument in Lemma 2.11 shows that periods of the formR\n\rs1\u0001\u0001\u0001sn2VS\nhave weight n\u00001 if\ris a loop.\nLemma 2.19. The monodromy representation of \u00191(MS)on the stalks ofVS\nis unipotent with respect to the weight \fltration W\u000fVS.\nProof. Consider the analytic continuation of a period integral L=R\n\rv2WnVS\naround a loop \u00112\u00191(MS).

Byott and\nElder deﬁned the reﬁned ramiﬁcation breaks of L/K, an extension of the usual\nramiﬁcation data. In this paper we give an alternative deﬁni tion for the reﬁned\nramiﬁcation breaks, and we use Artin-Schreier theory to com pute both versions\nof the breaks in some special cases.\n1 Introduction\nLetKbe a local ﬁeld whose residue ﬁeld Fis a perfect ﬁeld of characteristic pand\nletL/Kbe a ﬁnite totally ramiﬁed Galois extension. Let G= Gal(L/K) and set\n[L:K] =d=apn, withp∤a. Then the extension L/Khas at most npositive lower\nramiﬁcation breaks. In certain cases (for instance, if Gis cyclic)L/Kmust have exactly\nnpositive ramiﬁcation breaks. When L/Khas fewer than npositive ramiﬁcation breaks\none might hope to replace the missing breaks with some other informa tion.\nOne attempt to supply the missing information was made by Fried [11] a nd Heier-\nmann [13], who deﬁned a set of data which Heiermann called the “indices of inseparabil-\nity” ofL/K. The indices of inseparability are equivalent to the usual ramiﬁcation data\nin the case where L/Khasnpositive ramiﬁcation breaks, and provide new information\nwhenL/Khas fewer than npositive breaks.\nNow consider the extreme situation where L/Khas a single ramiﬁcation break b,\nwithb>0. ThenG∼=Cn\npfor somen≥1, whereCpdenotes the cyclic group of order\np[10, III,Th.4.2]. In this setting Byott and Elder [2, 4] deﬁned “reﬁn ed ramiﬁcation\nbreaks” for L/Kin terms of the action of GonL: If char(K) =psetR=F[G], while if\nchar(K) = 0 letR=W[G], whereWis the ring of Witt vectors over F. In either case\n1letAdenote the augmentation ideal of R. Using “truncated exponentiation”, the group\n(1+A)/(1+Ap) can begiven thestructure of a vector space over the residue ﬁe ldF. The\nimage ofGin this group spans an F-vector space G[F]of dimension n. By considering\nthe action of (coset representatives of) elements of G[F]on elements ρ∈Lone can deﬁne\nnew ramiﬁcation breaks for L/K. An early observation was that nreﬁned ramiﬁcation\nbreaks are produced if ρgenerates a normal basis for L/K[2, Theorem 3.3], although it\nwas unknown how the values of these breaks depend upon the part icular normal basis\ngenerator chosen.\nIn[4]Byott andElder focusedonthecasewhere char( K) = 0,Kcontainsaprimitive\npth root of unity, and G∼=Cn\npwithn= 2. In [3], it had been observed that elements\nwhose valuation is congruent to bmodulopnsatisfy a “valuation criterion”: any ρ∈L\nsuch thatvL(ρ)≡b(modpn) is a normal basis generator for L/K. For this reason, the\nreﬁned ramiﬁcation breaks in [4] were deﬁned in terms of the action ofG[F]on valuation\ncriterion elements of L. Byott and Elder used Kummer theory to calculate the values\nof the two reﬁned ramiﬁcation breaks, and showed that these valu es are independent\nof choice of valuation criterion element. They also showed that in cer tain cases these\nnew breaks give information about the Galois module structure of L. It remains an\nopen question whether the values of the reﬁned ramiﬁcation break s are independent of\nthe choice of valuation criterion element for totally ramiﬁed Cn\np-extensions with a single\nramiﬁcation break when n≥3.\nIn this paper we once again consider totally ramiﬁed Cn\np-extensions L/Kwith a\nsingle ramiﬁcation break b>0. We propose a new deﬁnition for the reﬁned ramiﬁcation\nbreaks ofL/Kwhich depends on the action of G[F]on all ofL, rather than just on the\nvaluation criterion elements. This deﬁnition has the advantage of be ing independent of\nall choices, and gives breaks which are “necessary” for Galois modu le structure, as in\n[4] (see§5). It has the disadvantage that it is not obvious that it produces ndistinct\nbreaks. We apply these deﬁnitions to a certain class of elementary a belianp-extensions\nin characteristic p. This class includes all C2\np-extensions with a single ramiﬁcation break\naswell asthe“one-dimensional” extensions from[8]withasingleramiﬁ cationbreak. For\nthe extensions in this class, we use the results of [5] to show that th e two deﬁnitions of\nreﬁned ramiﬁcation breaks give the same values, and then compute these values in terms\nofArtin-Schreierequations. InRemark2.6anothersuﬃcient cond ition, duetoBondarko\n[1], is given for the two deﬁnitions of reﬁned ramiﬁcation break to be e quivalent. We\ndo not know whether the two deﬁnitions for reﬁned ramiﬁcation bre aks are equivalent\nmore generally.\nThe authors thank Nigel Byott for his careful reading of the pape r, and for asking\nabout the statement that has become Proposition 3.8.\n2 Reﬁned ramiﬁcation breaks\nLetKbe a local ﬁeld of characteristic pwith perfect residue ﬁeld F, and letL/K\nbe a totally ramiﬁed Cn\np-extension with a single ramiﬁcation break b >0. In this\n2section we give two deﬁnitions for the reﬁned ramiﬁcation breaks (o r reﬁned breaks) of\nL/K. Our deﬁnition of VC-reﬁned breaks (where VC stands for “valuat ion criterion”)\nis essentially the same as the deﬁnition of reﬁned breaks given in [4]. A s mentioned in\nthe introduction, for any valuation criterion element ρthis deﬁnition is guaranteed to\nproducendistinct reﬁned breaks, but we do not know that the values of the r eﬁned\nbreaks are independent of the choice of ρ. Our deﬁnition of SS-reﬁned breaks (where\nSS stands for “smallest shift”) diﬀers from the deﬁnition in [4] in that it depends on\nthe action of F[G] on all the elements of L, not just the action on valuation criterion\nelements. The values of the reﬁned breaks produced by this deﬁnit ion are independent\nof all choices, but it is an open question whether the deﬁnition always produces a\nfull complement of nreﬁned breaks. Each deﬁnition comes in diﬀerent versions which\ndepend on a parameter ksatisfying 2 ≤k≤p. The VC k-reﬁned breaks and the SS k-\nreﬁned breaks are deﬁned using cosets of Ak, whereAis the augmentation ideal of\nR=F[G]. These various deﬁnitions are not obviously equivalent, but in Corolla ry 4.4\nwe give suﬃcient conditions for the set of VC k-reﬁned breaks to be equal to the set of\nSSk-reﬁned breaks, and in Theorem 4.5 we give stronger conditions und er which these\nsets are independent of k. It would certainly be useful to have a better understanding\nof when our various sets of reﬁned breaks are the same and when t hey diﬀer. In all\nthe examples we are able to compute, the sets of VC k- and SS k-reﬁned breaks are equal\nand independent of k. Thus it would be interesting to ﬁnd an example of an extension\nL/Kfor which, say, the VC k-reﬁned breaks are diﬀerent from the VC k′-reﬁned breaks\nfor some 2 ≤k<k′≤p.\nSince the residue ﬁeld FofKis perfect, we have K∼=F((t)).

We say that ρ∈L×is a valuation\ncriterion element for L/KifvL(ρ)≡ −dL/K−1 (modpn). In [9] it is shown that\nevery valuation criterion element generates a normal basis for L/K. Since the only\nramiﬁcation break of L/Kisbwe havedL/K= (pn−1)(b+1). Therefore the valuation\ncriterion for ρ∈LisvL(ρ)≡b(modpn), in agreement with [3]. Let ρbe a valuation\ncriterion element for L/K. Forγ∈G[F]we deﬁne\niρ(γ) = max{vL((γ′−1)(ρ)) :γ′∈γ}.\nDeﬁnition 2.3.

In this case we say that the elements of Bρ,kare the VC k-reﬁned breaks of\nL/K.\nThe argument used to prove Theorem 3.3 of [2] shows that Bρ,kconsists ofndistinct\nelements. It follows from the proof of [4, Lemma 3] that when n= 2, the VC k-reﬁned\nbreaks ofL/Kare deﬁned for 2 ≤k≤p.\nWe wish to give an alternative deﬁnition for reﬁned ramiﬁcation break s ofL/K\nwhich takes into account the eﬀect of γ∈Ron the valuations of all the elements of L.\n5Motivated by the deﬁnition of the norm of a linear operator, and also by the deﬁnitions\nofCiandAiin [1, p.36], we set\nˆvL(γ) = min{vL(γ(x))−vL(x) :x∈L×}.\nThen ˆvL(γ) =∞if and only if γ= 0. Furthermore, for γ,δ∈Rwe have\nˆvL(γδ)≥ˆvL(γ)+ ˆvL(δ)\nˆvL(γ+δ)≥min{ˆvL(γ),ˆvL(δ)}.\nTherefore ˆvLis a pseudo-valuation on R(see [16, p.108]).\nLemma 2.4. Letγ∈Rand letx∈L×satisfyˆvL(γ) =vL(γ(x))−vL(x). Then for\neveryy∈L×such thatvL(y)≡vL(x) (modpn)we haveˆvL(γ) =vL(γ(y))−vL(y).\nProof.The assumption on yimplies that there is c∈Ksuch thatvL(cx) =vL(y) and\nvL(y−cx)>vL(y). Setz=y−cx. Then\nvL(γ(cx))−vL(cx) =vL(γ(x))−vL(x) = ˆvL(γ),\nso we have\nvL(γ(z))≥ˆvL(γ)+vL(z)>ˆvL(γ)+vL(cx) =vL(γ(cx)).\nIt follows that\nvL(γ(y))−vL(y) =vL(γ(cx)+γ(z))−vL(cx+z)\n=vL(γ(cx))−vL(cx)\n= ˆvL(γ).\nForγ∈Rdeﬁne\nˆvL(γ) = max{ˆvL(γ′) :γ′∈γ}.\nSupposeγ′∈γ,δ′∈δsatisfy ˆvL(γ′) = ˆvL(γ), ˆvL(δ′) = ˆvL(δ).

In this case we say that his an SS k-reﬁned break\nofL/K.\n6Remark 2.6. Letρbe a valuation criterion element for L/K. If the extension L/K\nis “semistable” in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.1.1 of [1] then by Theorem 4.4 of the same\npaper we have ˆ vL(γ) =vL(γ(ρ))−vL(ρ) for every γ∈R. Hence ifL/Kis a semistable\nextension then the ( ρ,k)-reﬁned breaks of L/Kare equal to the SS k-reﬁned breaks for\n2≤k≤p. In particular, the sets Bρ,kare independent of ρ, so the VC k-reﬁned breaks\nofL/Kare deﬁned in this case.\nLetγ∈1+A. Thenℓp(γ) =µ·(γ−1) for some µ∈1 +A. Hence for x∈Lwe\nhavevL((γ−1)(x)) =vL(ℓp(γ)(x)). It follows that ˆ vL(γ−1) = ˆvL(ℓp(γ)), and hence\nthat ˆvL(γ−1) = ˆvL(Λp(γ)). Therefore\nG[F]\nh={γ∈G[F]:Λp(γ)∈Jh}\nis anF-subspace of (1+ A)/(1+Ak) for allh≥0. It follows that the set of SS k-reﬁned\nramiﬁcation breaks of L/Kis\nEk={ˆvL(δ) :δ∈SpanF(Λp(G)),δ/ne}ationslash=1}. (2.3)\nWe deﬁne the multiplicity of an SS k-reﬁned break hto be the F-dimension of G[F]\nh/G[F]\nh+1.\nSinceG[F]=G[F]\n0has dimension noverF, the sum of the multiplicities of the SS k-reﬁned\nbreaks ofL/Kis equal ton.\nRemark 2.7. It follows fromthe above that |Ek| ≤n, but it’s not obvious why |Ek|=n\nshould hold. On the other hand, we saw that if the VC k-reﬁned ramiﬁcation breaks of\nL/Kare deﬁned then there are ndistinct VC k-reﬁned breaks.\nRemark 2.8. Supposek= 2. It follows from Corollary 2.2 that the map\nΛp: (1+A)/(1+A2)−→A/A2\ninduced by Λ p: 1 +A→Ais an isomorphism of vector spaces over F. Hence Λp(G)\nspans then-dimensional F-vector space A/A2. It follows that the set of SS 2-reﬁned\nbreaks ofL/Kis{ˆvL(δ) :δ∈A/A2,δ/ne}ationslash=0}. Therefore the SS 2-reﬁned breaks of L/K\ncan be deﬁned without recourse to truncated powers or the trun cated logarithm.\nRemark 2.9. Let 2≤ℓ≤kand letγ=γ+Ak∈G[F]. Then (γ−1)+Ak⊂(γ−1)+Aℓ,\nso we have ˆ vL((γ−1)+Ak)≤ˆvL((γ−1)+Aℓ). Therefore if we arrange the SS k-reﬁned\nbreaks and the SS ℓ-reﬁned breaks (counted with multiplicities) in nondecreasing order\nthen the SS k-reﬁned breaks are less than or equal to the corresponding SS ℓ-reﬁned\nbreaks. A similar argument shows that if ρ∈LsatisﬁesvL(ρ)≡b(modpn) then\nthe (ρ,k)-reﬁned breaks are less than or equal to the ( ρ,ℓ)-reﬁned breaks. It follows\nthat if the VC k-reﬁned breaks and the VC ℓ-reﬁned breaks are deﬁned then the VC k-\nreﬁned breaks are less than or equal to the VC ℓ-reﬁned breaks. Finally, it follows from\nDeﬁnitions 2.3 and 2.5 that the SS k-reﬁned breaks are less than or equal to the ( ρ,k)-\nreﬁned breaks and the VC k-reﬁned breaks.\n7We wish to give upper bounds for the reﬁned breaks of L/K. We need the following\nwell-known fact (see for instance [17, III, Prop.1.4]).\nLemma 2.10. LetL/Kbe a ﬁnite separable totally ramiﬁed extension of local ﬁeld s\nand letMdL/K\nLbe the diﬀerent of L/K. Letr∈Z.

LetMdL/K\nLbe the diﬀerent of L/K, letMdL/M\nL\nbe the diﬀerent of L/M, and let MdM/K\nMbe the diﬀerent of M/K. Letρ∈Lsatisfy\nvL(ρ) =−dL/K−1. Then\nvM(TrL/M(ρ)) =dL/M−dL/K\n[L:M]−1 =−dM/K−1.\nProof.Setm= [L:M]. By Lemma 2.10 we have Tr L/M(M−dL/K−1\nL) =Ms\nMand\nTrL/M(M−dL/K\nL) =Ms′\nMwith\ns=/floorleftbiggdL/M−dL/K−1\nm/floorrightbigg\ns′=/floorleftbiggdL/M−dL/K\nm/floorrightbigg\n.\nSinceMdL/K\nL=MdL/M\nL· MdM/K\nMwe getdL/K−dL/M=mdM/K. It follows that s=\n−dM/K−1 ands′=−dM/K. Hence Tr L/Minduces an isomorphism of OM-modules\nM−dL/K−1\nL/M−dL/K\nL∼=M−dM/K−1\nM/M−dM/K\nM.\nSinceρ+M−dL/K\nLgenerates M−dL/K−1\nL/M−dL/K\nLas anOM-module, it follows that\nTrL/M(ρ) +M−dM/K\nMgenerates M−dM/K−1\nM/M−dM/K\nMas anOM-module. We conclude\nthatvM(TrL/M(ρ)) =−dM/K−1.\nProposition 2.12. LetKbe a local ﬁeld of characteristic pand letL/Kbe a totally\nramiﬁedCn\np-extension with a single ramiﬁcation break b. Letρ∈LsatisfyvL(ρ)≡b\n(modpn), let2≤k≤p, and letb0< b1< ... < b n−1be the(ρ,k)-reﬁned breaks of\nL/K. Then for 0≤i<nwe havebi≤bpi.\nProof.ByRemark2.9itsuﬃcestoprovethepropositioninthecase k= 2. For1 ≤i≤n\nlet Ψi∈Abe such that vL(Ψi(ρ))−vL(ρ) =bn−i. Sinceb0,...,b n−1are distinct the\nimages of Ψ 1,...,ΨninA/A2form an F-basis forA/A2. Suppose bj> bpj. By the\nSteinitz Exchange Lemma there are τ1,...,τ j∈Gsuch that the images in A/A2of\nΨ1,...,Ψn−j,τ1−1,...,τ j−1 form a basis for A/A2. LetH∼=Cj\npbe the subgroup of\nGgenerated by τ1,...,τ jand letM=LHbe the ﬁxed ﬁeld of H. LetAHdenote the\n8augmentation ideal of F[G/H], and observe that the images of Ψ 1,...,Ψn−jinAH/A2\nH\nform a basis for AH/A2\nH.\nForc∈K×and Υ∈Awe have\nvL(Υ(cρ))−vL(cρ) =vL(Υ(ρ))−vL(ρ).\nHence the ( cρ,k)-reﬁned breaks of L/Kare the same as the ( ρ,k)-reﬁned breaks. There-\nfore we may assume that vL(ρ) =b−(b+1)pn=−dL/K−1. Then for 1 ≤i≤n−jwe\nhave\nvL(Ψi(ρ))≥bpj+1+vL(ρ) =bpj−dL/K.\nHence by Proposition 2.11 and Lemma 2.10 we get\nvM(Ψi(TrL/M(ρ)))−vM(TrL/M(ρ)) =vM(TrL/M(Ψi(ρ)))−/parenleftbiggdL/M−dL/K\npj−1/parenrightbigg\n≥/floorleftbiggbpj−dL/K+dL/M\npj/floorrightbigg\n−dL/M−dL/K\npj+1\n=b+1.\nSince the images of Ψ 1,...,Ψn−jspanAH/A2\nHoverF, and\nvM(TrL/M(ρ)) =−(b+1)(pn−j−1)−1\nis not divisible by p, it follows that the lower ramiﬁcation breaks of M/Kare all≥b+1.\nSince the only lower ramiﬁcation break of M/Kisb, this is a contradiction. Hence we\nmust havebi≤bpifor 0≤i≤n−1.\nCorollary 2.13. LetKbe a local ﬁeld of characteristic pand letL/Kbe a totally\nramiﬁedCn\np-extension with a single ramiﬁcation break b.

These elements γimotivated a\nconstruction in [8] referred to as a “Galois scaﬀold”. The propertie s of this Galois\nscaﬀold led to the general deﬁnition of scaﬀold in [6]. In this section, w e return to\nthe construction in [8], but, as our aim is to study the VC k- and SS k-reﬁned breaks of\nthese extensions, we restrict our attention to those extensions with only one ramiﬁcation\nbreak.\n9LetL/Kbe aCn\np-extension with a single ramiﬁcation break b >0. As observed\nin section 2, there is Artin-Schreier data ( β,/vector ω,/vector ǫ) such that L=K(x1,...,x n), where\nxi∈Ksepis a root of the polynomial Xp−X−ωpn\niβ−ǫiwithvK(β) =−b < vK(ǫi)\nandωi∈F. Recall that ω1,...,ω nare linearly independent over Fp. We now consider,\nfor each 1 ≤r≤n, the restriction: for all 1 ≤i≤n,\nvK(ǫi)>−b/pn−r. (3.1)\nAt one extreme, r=n, this is no additional restriction. At the other extreme, r= 1, a\nGalois scaﬀold exists.\n3.1 The case r= 1\nObserve that (3.1) with r= 1 is precisely Assumption 3.3 in [5] for extensions with one\nramiﬁcation break b >0. As a result, these extensions possess a Galois scaﬀold. The\noriginal construction of a Galois scaﬀold in [8] can be broken into two s eparate parts, as\nwas done in [5]. In [5, §3], ﬁeld elements of nice valuation are constructed upon which\nthe Galois action is easily described. In [5, §2], these elements and the nice description\nof the Galois action are used to construct the two ingredients of a s caﬀold:λw∈L\nwithvL(λw) =wfor allw∈Z, and Ψ i∈K[G] for 1≤i≤nsuch that Ψ i(λw)∈Lis\ncongruent either to λxfor somex∈Z, or to 0. In this section, we introduce a method\nthat allows us to more easily construct the ﬁeld elements of nice valua tion constructed\nby [5,§3]. Namely, we construct Y∈Lsuch thatvL(Y) =−band (σ−1)(Y)∈Ffor all\nσ∈Gal(L/K). Sincep∤bthe condition vL(Y) =−bimpliesL=K(Y). We reference\n[5,§2] for the construction of the rest of the ingredients of the Galois scaﬀold.\nLet/vector x∈Lnbe the column vector whose ith entry is xiand deﬁne the Frobenius\nendomorphism φ:L→Lbyφ(α) =αp. Thenφ(/vector x) =/vector x+βφn(/vector ω)+/vector ǫ. Let\nY= det([/vector x,φ(/vector ω),φ2(/vector ω),...,φn−1(/vector ω)]). (3.2)\nBy expanding in cofactors along the ﬁrst column we get\nY=t1x1+t2x2+···+tnxn, (3.3)\nwithti∈F. Letσ∈Gand setui=σ(xi)−xi∈Fp. Then\nσ(Y)−Y=t1u1+t2u2+···+tnun∈F. (3.4)\nLet 1≤i≤n. Sinceω1,...,ω i−1,ωi+1,...,ω nare linearly independent over Fp, the\nfollowing lemma implies ti/ne}ationslash= 0.\nLemma 3.1. Letα1,...,α d∈Fbe linearly independent over Fp, and let/vector αbe the column\nvector with dentries whose ith entry is αi. Then\ndet([/vector α,φ(/vector α),φ2(/vector α),...,φd−1(/vector α)])/ne}ationslash= 0.\n10Proof.Sinceα1,...,α d∈Fare linearly independent over Fp, this Moore determinant is\nnonzero [12, Lemma 1.3.3].\nProposition 3.2. We havevL(Y) =−b, and hence L=K(Y).\nProof.We claim that for 0 ≤j≤n−1 we have\nφj(Y)≡det([/vector x,φj+1(/vector ω),φj+2(/vector ω),...,φj+n−1(/vector ω)]) (mod M−bpj+1\nL).(3.5)\nThe claim holds for j= 0 by the deﬁnition of Y. Let 1≤j≤n−1 and assume the\nclaim holds for j−1. Observe that φ(/vector x) =/vector x+βφn(/vector ω) +/vector ǫand that, because r= 1,\nvL(ǫi)≥ −bp+1≥ −bpj+1. Therefore we get\nφj(Y)≡φ(det([/vector x,φj(/vector ω),φj+1(/vector ω),...,φj+n−2(/vector ω)])) (mod Mp(−bpj−1+1)\nL )\n≡det([/vector x+βφn(/vector ω)+/vector ǫ,φj+1(/vector ω),φj+2(/vector ω),...,φj+n−1(/vector ω)]) (mod M−bpj+1\nL)\n≡det([/vector x+βφn(/vector ω),φj+1(/vector ω),φj+2(/vector ω),...,φj+n−1(/vector ω)]) (mod M−bpj+1\nL).\nSincej+1≤n≤j+n−1 it follows that\nφj(Y)≡det([/vector x,φj+1(/vector ω),φj+2(/vector ω),...,φj+n−1(/vector ω)]) (mod M−bpj+1\nL).\nTherefore by induction the claim holds for 0 ≤j≤n−1. The same reasoning with\nj=ngives\nφn(Y)≡det([/vector x+βφn(/vector ω),φn+1(/vector ω),φn+2(/vector ω),...,φ2n−1(/vector ω)]) (mod M−bpn+1\nL).\nSincevL(xi) =−bpn−1we get\nφn(Y)≡det([βφn(/vector ω),φn+1(/vector ω),φn+2(/vector ω),...,φ2n−1(/vector ω)]) (mod M−bpn+1\nL)\n≡βdet([φn(/vector ω),φn+1(/vector ω),φn+2(/vector ω),...,φ2n−1(/vector ω)]) (mod M−bpn+1\nL).\nIt follows from Lemma 3.1 that vL(Ypn) =vL(β), and hence that pnvL(Y) =−bpn.\nThusvL(Y) =−b. Sincep∤bthis implies L=K(Y).\nThe main result of this section, Theorem 3.4, says that the extensio nL/Kpossesses\na Galois scaﬀold. To give the deﬁnition of a Galois scaﬀold, using notatio n consistent\nwith [5, 6], we ﬁrst deﬁne a:Z→Z/pnZby setting a(t) =−b−1t+pnZ, whereb−1\ndenotes the multiplicative inverse of the class of binZ/pnZ. We then express a(t) in\nbasepby writing\na(t) = (a(t)(0)p0+a(t)(1)p1+···+a(t)(n−1)pn−1)+pnZ\nwith 0≤a(t)(i)<p. Specializing Deﬁnition 2.3 of [6] to our setting we get:\nDeﬁnition 3.3. LetL/Kbe a totally ramiﬁed Cn\np-extension of local ﬁelds with a\nsingle ramiﬁcation break b. A Galois scaﬀold for L/Kwith inﬁnite precision consists of\nelementsλw∈Lfor allw∈Zand Ψ i∈K[G] for 1≤i≤nsuch that the following\nhold:\n11(i)vL(λw) =wfor allw∈Z.\n(ii)λw1λ−1\nw2∈Kwheneverw1≡w2(modpn).\n(iii) Ψ i·1 = 0 for 1 ≤i≤n.\n(iv) For 1 ≤i≤nandw∈Zthere exists uiw∈ O×\nKsuch that the following holds:\nΨi(λw) =/braceleftBigg\nuiwλw+pn−ibifa(w)(n−i)≥1,\n0 if a(w)(n−i)= 0.\nTheorem 3.4. LetL/Kbe aCn\np-extension with a single ramiﬁcation break b. Assume\nthere is Artin-Schreier data (β,/vector ω,/vector ǫ)forL/Ksuch thatvK(ǫi)>−b/pn−1for1≤i≤n.\nThen the extension L/Khas a Galois scaﬀold ({λw},{Ψi})with inﬁnite precision such\nthatuiw= 1for alli,wandΨi∈F[G]for1≤i≤n. Furthermore, the image of 1+Ψi\ninR=F[G]/Aplies inG[F].\nProof.For 1≤i≤nletxi∈Ksepbe a root of Xp−X−ωpn\niβ−ǫi. For 0≤i≤n\nsetKi=K(x1,...,x i), so thatK=K0andL=Kn. Letσ1,...,σ nbe generators for\nG= Gal(L/K) such that ( σi−1)(xj) =δijfor 1≤i,j≤n. For 1≤i≤nconstruct a\ngeneratorYifor the extension Ki/Kas in (3.2). For 1 ≤j≤isetµij= (σj−1)(Yi).\nThenµij/ne}ationslash= 0 sinceKi=K(Yi), and by (3.4) we have µij∈F. SetXi=Yi/µii. Then\nKi=Ki−1(Xi) and (σi−1)(Xi) = 1. It follows from Theorem 2.10 in [5] that L/Khas\na Galois scaﬀold ( {λw},{Ψi}) with inﬁnite precision such that uiw= 1 for alli,w. (This\nresult appeared ﬁrst as Corollary 4.2 in [8].) Since µij∈Fit follows from Deﬁnition 2.7\nin [5] that Ψ i∈F[G] and (1+Ψ i)+Ap∈G[F]for 1≤i≤n.\nLet ({λw},{Ψi}) be the scaﬀold for L/K, and letρbe a valuation criterion element\nforL/K. ThenvL(ρ)≡b(modpn), so we have a(vL(ρ)) = (pn−1) +pnZ. For\n0≤t < pnwritet=t(0)+t(1)p+···+t(n−1)pn−1with 0≤t(i)< pand deﬁne\nΨ(t)= Ψt(0)\nnΨt(1)\nn−1...Ψt(n−1)\n1. Using induction we see that for 0 ≤t<pnwe have\nvL(Ψ(t)(ρ)) =vL(ρ)+bt (3.6)\na(vL(Ψ(t)(ρ))) = (pn−1−t)+pnZ,\nwhile for general α∈L, we havevL(Ψ(t)(α))≥vL(α)+bt.\n3.2 The case r>1\nThe existence of a Galois scaﬀold, or even a partial Galois scaﬀold, ca n be used to\ndetermine the values of VC k- and SS k-reﬁned breaks. In this section we examine con-\nditions that produce partial Galois scaﬀolds. To begin we need to look more closely at\nC2\np-extensions. The following lifting lemma will enable us to lift Artin-Schre ier data, in\nparticularβ∈Kand/vector ǫ∈Kn, up intoK(x1) andK(x1)n, respectively. This lemma is\ncrucial, both here and in the next section.\n12Lemma 3.5. LetM/Kbe a totally ramiﬁed C2\np-extension with a single ramiﬁcation\nbreakband Artin-Schreier data (β,/vector ω,/vector ǫ). Assume without loss of generality that ω1= 1\nandǫ1= 0, so thatM=K(x1,x2)withxp\n1−x1=βandxp\n2−x2=ωp2\n2β+ǫ2. Then the\nfollowing hold:\n(a) There exist ζ,E∈K(x1)such thatζp−ζ=E−ǫ2andvK(x1)(ζ) =vK(x1)(E) =−e2,\nwheree2=−vK(ǫ2). Furthermore, vK(x1)(E−℘(ω2)px1) =−b.\n(b) Letζ,Ebe as in (a) and set X=x2−ωp\n2x1+ζ. ThenXp−X=−℘(ω2)px1+E\nandM=K(X).\nProof.(a) Letz∈Ksepsatisfyzp−z=ǫ2. By the deﬁnition of Artin-Schreier data\nwe have either e2>0 andp∤e2, orǫ2∈F. Suppose e2>0 andp∤e2. Then\nb,e2are the upper ramiﬁcation breaks of K(x1,z)/K. Sincee2< bit follows that e2\nis also a lower ramiﬁcation break of K(x1,z)/K. HenceK(x1,z)/K(x1) is a totally\nramiﬁedCp-extension with ramiﬁcation break e2. Hence by Artin-Schreier theory there\nareζ,E∈K(x1) such that ( z+ζ)p−(z+ζ) =EandvK(x1)(ζ) =vK(x1)(E) =−e2. If\nǫ2∈F×we setζ= 1 andE=ǫ2. ThenvK(x1)(ζ) =vK(x1)(E) = 0 =−e2. Ifǫ2= 0 we\nsetζ=E= 0. Then vK(x1)(ζ) =vK(x1)(E) =∞=−e2. Henceζp−ζ=E−ǫ2and\nvK(x1)(ζ) =vK(x1)(E) =−e2inallcases. Inaddition, since1 ,ω2arelinearlyindependent\noverFpwe haveω2/ne}ationslash∈Fp, and hence ℘(ω2)/ne}ationslash= 0. Since\nvK(x1)(E) =−e2>−b=vK(x1)(x1)\nit follows that vK(x1)(E−℘(ω2)px1) =−b.\n(b) By the deﬁnition of Xwe get\nXp−X=xp\n2−x2−ωp2\n2xp\n1+ωp\n2x1+ζp−ζ\n=ωp2\n2β+ǫ2−ωp2\n2β−ωp2\n2x1+ωp\n2x1+E−ǫ2\n=−℘(ω2)px1+E.\nSinceX∈MandvM(X) =−bwithp∤bit follows that M=K(X).\nProposition 3.6. LetL/Kbe aCn\np-extension with a single ramiﬁcation break b. Let\n0<c<b, and assume that there exists Artin-Schreier data (β,/vector ω,/vector ǫ)forL/Ksuch that\nvK(ǫi)>−cfor1≤i≤n. Letx1∈Ksepsatisfyxp\n1−x1=ωpn\n1β+ǫ1, and setK1=\nK(x1). Then there is Artin-Schreier data (x1,/vectorΩ,/vectorE)forL/K1such thatvK1(Ei)>−c\nfor2≤i≤n.\nProof.By replacing βwithβ′=ωpn\n1β+ǫ1me may assume without loss of generality\nthatω1= 1 andǫ1= 0. For 2 ≤i≤nletxi∈Ksepsatisfyxp\ni−xi=ωpn\niβ+ǫi. By\napplying Lemma 3.5 to K(x1,xi)/Kwe getζi,Ei∈K1such thatζp\ni−ζi=Ei−ǫiand\nvK1(ζi) =vK1(Ei) =vL(ǫi). SetXi=xi−ωpn−1\nix1+ζi. ThenK1(Xi) =K1(xi), so we\nhave\nL=K1(x2,...,x n) =K1(X2,...,Xn).\n13Wealsohave Xp\ni−Xi=−℘(ωi)pn−1x1+EiwithvK1(x1) =−bandvK1(Ei) =vL(ǫi)>−c.\nSince SpanFp{1,ω2,...,ω n}hasFp-dimension n, and℘:F→Fis anFp-linear map with\nkernelFp, we see that ℘(ω2),...,℘(ωn) are linearly independent over Fp.

LetL/Kbe aCn\np-extension with a single ramiﬁcation break b. Let\n0<c<b, and assume that there exists Artin-Schreier data (β,/vector ω,/vector ǫ)forL/Ksuch that\nvK(ǫi)>−cfor1≤i≤n.

ThenL/Krhas a Galois scaﬀold ({λw},{Ψi}r+1≤i≤n)\nwith inﬁnite precision such that Ψi∈Rrand the image of 1+ΨiinRr=Rr/Ap\nrlies in\nG[F]\nrforr+1≤i≤n.\nProof.By Corollary 3.7 there is Artin-Schreier data ( xr,/vectorΩ,/vectorE) forL/Krsuch that\nvKr(Ei)>−b/pn−1−rforr+ 1≤i≤n. Since [L:Kr] =pn−rit follows from\nTheorem 3.4 that L/Krhas a Galois scaﬀold ( {λw},{Ψi}r+1≤i≤n) with the speciﬁed\nproperties.\nRemark 3.9. Suppose there is Artin-Schreier data ( β,/vector ω,/vector ǫ) forL/Kwhich satisﬁes\nthe hypotheses of Proposition 3.8. Let L/K′\nrbe a subextension of L/Ksuch that\n[K′\nr:K] =pr. Then there is Artin-Schreier data ( β,/vector ω′,/vector ǫ′) forL/Ksuch that:\n1. There is A∈GLn(Fp) such that /vector ω′=A/vector ωand/vector ǫ′=A/vector ǫ.\n2.K′\nr=K(x′\n1,...,x′\nr) withx′p\ni−x′\ni=ω′pn\niβ+ǫ′\nifor 1≤i≤r.\nIt follows that ( β,/vector ω′,/vector ǫ′) also satisﬁes the hypotheses of Proposition 3.8. Therefore the\nconclusion of Proposition 3.8 holds for L/K′\nr.\n4 Computing reﬁned breaks\nLetL/Kbe a totally ramiﬁed Cn\np-extension with a single ramiﬁcation break b, and\nsetG= Gal(L/K). In [4, Lemma 3] it was observed that when n= 2 the extension\nL/Khas the following property: There is a subgroup H≤Gwith index psuch that\n14L/LHhas a Galois scaﬀold consisting of elements of K[G]. This property is used in\n[4] to prove that the values of the ( ρ,p)-reﬁned breaks are independent of the choice of\nvaluation criterion element ρ. Now suppose char( K) =pandn≥2. It follows from\nProposition 3.8 that if L/Khas Artin-Schreier data satisfying (3.1) with r= 2 then\nL/Kalso has this property. In this section we use this observation to sh ow that for this\nfamily of extensions the VC k- and SS k-reﬁned breaks are equal and independent of k.\n4.1 An equivalence condition for SS k- and VC k-reﬁned breaks\nTo prove our ﬁrst main result we need two basic lemmas.\nLemma 4.1. LetL/Kbe a totally ramiﬁed Cn\np-extension with a single ramiﬁcation\nbreakb>0. Assume that L/Khas a Galois scaﬀold ({λw},{Ψi})with inﬁnite precision\nsuch that Ψi∈F[G]for1≤i≤n. Then the augmentation ideal AofF[G]is generated\nbyΨ1,...,Ψn.\nProof.LetIdenote the ideal in F[G] generated by Ψ 1,...,Ψn, andletIdenote theideal\ninK[G] generated by Ψ 1,...,Ψn. LetAdenote the augmentation ideal of K[G]. Then\nthe isomorphism F[G]⊗FK∼=K[G] induces isomorphisms A⊗FK∼=AandI⊗FK∼=I.\nTherefore it suﬃces to prove that A=I. Letρbe a valuation criterion element of L/K.\nThen the map η:K[G]→Ldeﬁned by η(γ) =γ(ρ) is an isomorphism of K-vector\nspaces. For 1 ≤s < pnwe havevL(Ψ(s)(ρ)) =vL(ρ) +bs. Therefore the elements of\n{η(Ψ(s)) : 1≤s < pn}haveL-valuations which represent distinct congruence classes\nmodulopn. Hence dim K(I) = dim K(η(I))≥pn−1. SinceI ⊂ Aand dim K(A) =pn−1\nit follows that I=A.\nLemma 4.2. Letσ∈Gand letα,β∈L. Then for 0≤r≤p−1we have\n(σ−1)r(αβ) =α·(σ−1)r(β)+r/summationdisplay\ni=0(−1)r−i/parenleftbiggr\ni/parenrightbigg\n(σi−1)(α)·σi(β).\nProof.We have\nr/summationdisplay\ni=0(−1)r−i/parenleftbiggr\ni/parenrightbigg\n(σi−1)(α)·σi(β) =r/summationdisplay\ni=0(−1)r−i/parenleftbiggr\ni/parenrightbigg\nσi(αβ)−αr/summationdisplay\ni=0(−1)r−i/parenleftbiggr\ni/parenrightbigg\nσi(β)\n= (σ−1)r(αβ)−α·(σ−1)r(β).\nTheorem 4.3. LetL/Kbe aCn\np-extension with a single ramiﬁcation break b >0.\nAssume that there is Artin-Schreier data (β,/vector ω,/vector ǫ)forL/Ksuch thatvK(ǫi)>−b/pn−2\nfor1≤i≤n. Letρbe a valuation criterion element for L/K. Then for every\nΥ∈A/integerdivideA2we haveˆvL(Υ) =vL(Υ(ρ))−vL(ρ).\nProof.We may assume without loss of generality that ω1= 1 andǫ1= 0. Letx1∈L\nsatisfyxp\n1−x1=β, setK1=K(x1), and letG1= Gal(L/K1). Then by Proposition 3.8\nthereisascaﬀold( {λw},{Ψi}2≤i≤n)forL/K1withinﬁniteprecisionsuchthatΨ i∈F[G1]\n15for 2≤i≤n. Chooseθ∈L×which minimizes vL(Υ(θ))−vL(θ). Sincep∤bthere is\n0≤s<pn−1such that\nbs≡vL(θ)−vL(ρ) (modpn−1).\nHence there is a∈K1such thatvL(θ) =vL(a)+bs+vL(ρ). SincevL(ρ)≡bmodpn−1,\nit follows from (3.6) that\nvL(Ψ(s)(ρ)) =vL(ρ)+bs.\nThusvL(θ) =vL(aΨ(s)(ρ)). By Lemma 2.4 we have\nvL(Υ(aΨ(s)(ρ)))−vL(aΨ(s)(ρ)) =vL(Υ(θ))−vL(θ).\nHence we may assume that θ=aΨ(s)(ρ).\nLetσ∈Gbe such that σ|K1generates Gal( K1/K). Then by Lemma 4.1 we have\nΥ =p−1/summationdisplay\nr=0pn−1−1/summationdisplay\nt=0crt(σ−1)rΨ(t)\nfor somecrt∈F. Using Lemma 4.2 we get\n(σ−1)r(Ψ(t)(θ)) = (σ−1)r(aΨ(t)Ψ(s)(ρ))\n=a(σ−1)r(Ψ(t)Ψ(s)(ρ))+r/summationdisplay\ni=0(−1)r−i/parenleftbiggr\ni/parenrightbigg\n(σi−1)(a)·σi(Ψ(t)Ψ(s)(ρ)).\nFor 0≤i≤rthe ﬁrst factor in the ith term in the sum above has L-valuation at least\nvL(a) +bpn−1, and the second factor has L-valuation at least bt+vL(Ψ(s)(ρ)). Hence\nthe terms in the sum all have L-valuations at least\nvL(a)+bpn−1+bt+vL(Ψ(s)(ρ)) =bpn−1+bt+vL(θ).\nIt follows that\n(σ−1)r(Ψ(t)(θ))≡a(σ−1)r(Ψ(t)Ψ(s)(ρ)) (modθ·Mbpn−1\nL)\nand hence that\nΥ(θ)≡aΥ(Ψ(s)(ρ)) (modθ·Mbpn−1\nL)\n≡aΨ(s)(Υ(ρ)) (modθ·Mbpn−1\nL).\nConsidering Υ( ρ) to be a generic element of L, we havevL(Ψ(s)(Υ(ρ)))≥vL(Υ(ρ))+bs.\nTherefore,\nvL(Υ(θ))−vL(θ)≥min{vL(a)+bs+vL(Υ(ρ))−(vL(a)+vL(Ψ(s)(ρ))),bpn−1}\n= min{vL(Υ(ρ))−vL(ρ),bpn−1}\n=vL(Υ(ρ))−vL(ρ),\nwhere the last equality follows from Υ /ne}ationslash∈A2and the case k= 2 of Proposition 2.12. We\nconclude that ˆ vL(Υ) =vL(Υ(ρ))−vL(ρ).\n16Corollary 4.4. LetL/Kbe aCn\np-extension with a single ramiﬁcation break b. Assume\nthere is Artin-Schreier data (β,/vector ω,/vector ǫ)forL/Ksuch thatvK(ǫi)>−b/pn−2for1≤i≤n.\nThen for 2≤k≤pthe set of VC k-reﬁned breaks of L/Kis deﬁned and equal to the set\nof SSk-reﬁned breaks of L/K.\n4.2 Explicit computation of reﬁned breaks\nBy strengthening the assumption in Theorem 4.3, we can explicitly det ermine the values\nof the reﬁned ramiﬁcation breaks. We will do so by following the proce ss used earlier in\n§3.1, as well as in [5, §5].\nTheorem 4.5. Letn≥2and letL/Kbe aCn\np-extension with a single ramiﬁcation\nbreakb. Let(β,/vector ω,/vector ǫ)be Artin-Schreier data for L/Ksuch thatω1= 1andǫ1= 0. For\n2≤i≤nsetei=−vK(ǫi), and assume that en<b/pn−2andei<enfor2≤i≤n−1.\nLet\nb∗= min{(b−en)pn−1+b,bpn−1}\nB1={b,bp,...,bpn−2,b∗}.\nThen for 2≤k≤p, the set of VC k-reﬁned breaks of L/Kis deﬁned and equal to B1,\nand the set of SS k-reﬁned breaks of L/Kis equal toB1.\nRemark 4.6. LetL/Kbe an extension which satisﬁes the hypotheses of Theorem 4.5.\nEquation (4.20) in [15] gives a description of L/Kin terms of certain parameters\nw0,w1,...,w n−1fromKsatisfyingvK(wi)≥ −bandvK(w0) =−b. (Beware that\nwi/ne}ationslash=ωi.) Assume thatthe Fp-spanof1 = ω1,ω2,...,ω nformsasubﬁeld FpnofFwithpn\nelements. Then by Lemma 5.2 of [15] we have vK(wi)≥ −enfor 1≤i≤n−1. Further-\nmore, using the fact that ei<enfor 2≤i≤n−1 it canbe shown that vK(wn−1) =−en.\nAssumeb<p, so that we can use Theorem 5.1 of [15] to compute the indices of ins ep-\narability of L/K. We getin= 0,in−1=bpn+min{−enpn−1,−b}, andij=bpn−bfor\n0≤j≤n−2. By applying Theorem 4.5 we deduce that ij=bj+bpn−bpj−bfor\n0≤i≤n−1, whereb0<b1<···<bn−1are the reﬁned breaks of L/K. We note that\nthese results are in agreement with the formulas relating indices of in separability and\nreﬁned breaks for C2\np-extensions in characteristic 0 given in Theorem 4.6 of [14].\nThe proof of Theorem 4.5 will occupy the rest of this section. For an y valuation\ncriterion element ρforL/Kit suﬃces, by Corollary 4.4, to prove that for 2 ≤k≤p,B1\nis the set of ( ρ,k)-reﬁned breaks of L/K. For Υ∈F[G] we deﬁne, depending upon ρ,\nˆvρ(Υ) =vL(Υ(ρ))−vL(ρ)\nˆvρ(Υ+Ak) = max{ˆvρ(Υ′) : Υ′∈Υ+Ak}.\nNote that ˆvρ(Υ+Ak) =iρ(Υ). So to prove that B1is the set of ( ρ,k)-reﬁned breaks for\n2≤k≤pit is enough to ﬁrst, construct Ψ 1,...,Ψn∈F[G] such that\nB1={ˆvρ(Ψi) : 1≤i≤n} (4.1)\nand second, prove ˆ vρ(Ψ′\ni)≤ˆvρ(Ψi) for all Ψ′\ni∈Ψi+A2.\n174.2.1 Construction of Ψ1,...,Ψn∈F[G]satisfying (4.1)\nWe ﬁrst separate oﬀ the case when en<b/pn−1(and hence b∗=bpn−1). Ifen<b/pn−1\nthen by Theorem 3.4 we get a scaﬀold ( {λw},{Ψi}) forL/Ksuch that Ψ i∈F[G] for\n1≤i≤n. By (3.6) we see that Ψ 1,...,Ψnsatisfy (4.1). Thus we may assume for\nthe remainder of the argument that en≥b/pn−1>0, which means, by the deﬁnition\nof Artin-Schreier data, that we have p∤en. Recall that L=K(x1,...,x n), where\nxi∈Ksepsatisfyxp\n1−x1=β, andxp\ni−xi=ωpn\niβ+ǫifor 2≤i≤n. For 0≤i≤nlet\nKi=K(x1,...,x i); thenK=K0andL=Kn. Letσ1,...,σ nbe generators for G=\nGal(L/K) such that ( σi−1)(xj) =δij. As in the proof of Proposition 3.6, by applying\nLemma 3.5 to K(x1,xi)/Kfor 2≤i≤n, we getζi,Ei∈K1such thatζp\ni−ζi=Ei−ǫi\nandvK1(ζi) =vK1(Ei) =−ei. SetXi=xi−ωpn−1\nix1+ζi. Then by Lemma 3.5 we get\nXp\ni−Xi=−℘(ωi)pn−1x1+Ei. For 1≤i≤nwe haveKi=K1(X2,...,Xi), and for\n2≤i≤nwe have−ωpn−1\nix1+ζi∈K1. It follows that ( σj−1)(Xi) =δijfor 2≤i,j≤n.\nFor 2≤i≤nconstruct ˜Yifor the extension Ki/K1using the Artin-Schreier equa-\ntions\nXp\nj−Xj=−℘(ωj)pn−1x1+Ej\nfor2≤j≤i, justasYwasconstructedin(3.2). (Thus nisreplacedby i−1,βisreplaced\nbyx1, andωjis replaced by −℘(ωj+1)pn−i.) Using (3.3) we write ˜Yi=˜ti2X2+···+˜tiiXi\nwith˜tij∈F. By Lemma 3.1 we see that ˜tij/ne}ationslash= 0 for 2 ≤j≤i≤n. Therefore we may\ndeﬁneYi=˜Yi/˜tii. ThenYi=ti2X2+···+tiiXiwithtij=˜tij/˜tii∈F×andtii= 1. We\nalso deﬁne Y1=x1.\nFor 2≤j≤i≤nwe have\n(σj−1)(Yi) =i/summationdisplay\nh=2tih(σj−1)(Xh) =tij. (4.2)\nAdditionally, since Xh=xh−ωpn−1\nhx1+ζhwe have\n(σ1−1)(Yi) =i/summationdisplay\nh=2tih(−ωpn−1\nh+(σ1−1)(ζh))\nforj= 1≤i≤n. Hence (σ1−1)(Yi) =ti1+Zi, where\nti1=−i/summationdisplay\nh=2tihωpn−1\nh∈F\nZi=i/summationdisplay\nh=2tih(σ1−1)(ζh)∈K1.\nFor 2≤i≤n−1 we get\nvK1(Zi)≥min{vK1((σ1−1)(ζh)) : 2≤h≤i}\n≥min{b−eh: 2≤h≤i}\n>b−en.\n18Recall that we have assumed en≥b/pn−1>0, and thus p∤en. This means that\nvK1((σ1−1)(ζn)) =b−en. Sincetnn∈F×we getvK1(Zn) =b−en. Observe that\nvK1(Zi)>0 for 2≤i≤n. By (3.2) and elementary column operations we get\nti1=−˜t−1\niidet[φn−1(/vector ω(i)),φ(−φn−i(℘(/vector ω(i)))),...,φi−2(−φn−i(℘(/vector ω(i))))]\n=−˜t−1\niidet([φn−1(/vector ω(i)),φn−i+1(/vector ω(i))−φn−i+2(/vector ω(i)),...,φn−2(/vector ω(i))−φn−1(/vector ω(i))])\n=−˜t−1\niidet([φn−1(/vector ω(i)),φn−i+1(/vector ω(i)),φn−i+2(/vector ω(i)),...,φn−2(/vector ω(i))])\nwhere\n/vector ω(i)=\nω2\n...\nωi\n.\nHence by Lemma 3.1 we have ti1/ne}ationslash= 0.\nWe are now prepared to construct Ψ jfor 1≤j≤n. Following [5, Deﬁnition 2.7],\nwe deﬁne Θ n,Θn−1,...,Θ1iteratively by Θ n=σnand\nΘj=σjΘ[−tnj]\nnΘ[−tn−1,j]\nn−1...Θ[−tj+1,j]\nj+1.\nThenΘ j∈F[σj,σj+1,...,σ n]. SetΨ j= Θj−1. It remainstoprovethatthese Ψ j∈F[G]\nhave the desired properties.\nFirst we consider Ψ jfor 2≤j≤n. The scaﬀold for L/K1given by Proposition 3.8\nhasthe form( {λw},{Ψj}2≤j≤n) for someλw∈L. Sinceρis a valuationcriterion element\nforL/Kwe havevL(ρ)≡b(modpn−1), soρis also a valuation criterion element for\nL/K1. Since Ψ j= Ψ(pn−j), by equation (3.6) we have vL(Ψj(ρ))−vL(ρ) =bpn−jfor\n2≤j≤n. These Ψ jhave the needed properties.\nNow we consider Ψ 1. In checking the needed properties we may work with any\nvaluation criterion element ρ∈L. So choose\nρ=/parenleftbiggY1\np−1/parenrightbigg/parenleftbiggY2\np−1/parenrightbigg\n.../parenleftbiggYn\np−1/parenrightbigg\n. (4.3)\nIndeed, since vL(Yh) =−bpn−h<0, for 0≤r≤p−1 we havevL/parenleftbig/parenleftbigYh\nr/parenrightbig/parenrightbig\n=−rbpn−h.\nHenceρsatisﬁesvL(ρ) =−(pn−1)b≡b(modpn), soρis a valuation criterion element\nforL/K.\nTo compute vL(Ψ1(ρ))−vL(ρ), we will need certain details from [5].

We include the proof, since it lead s\nnaturally to Lemma 4.8, which is needed to handle the case j= 1. Use reverse induction\nonj.

Then there exists an element Υ ∈A2, namely Υ = Ψ i−Ψ′\ni,\nsuch thatvL(Υ(ρ)) =vL(Ψi(ρ)). Based upon the recursive deﬁnition of the Θ j, the Ψ j\ngenerateA.

There are three categories of mathematical model that\nresearchers have developed to describe this biological phenomena [23]. The \frst one is discrete\nmodel where space is divided into a lattice of points with the variables de\fned only at the points\nand time changes in \"jump\" [5], [9], [21], [22]. The second one is the continuous model where\nall variables are considered to be de\fned at every point in space and time changes continuously.\nThe last one is the hybrid which is a mixture of the previous two [1], [3]. Each of these models\nhave advantages and disadvantages depending on the phenomenon under consideration, and on\nthe length scale over which we wish to investigate the phenomenon.\nDiscrete models of biophysical processes are of use when we are interested in the behavior of\nindividual cells, as well as their interactions with other cells and the medium which surrounds\nthem [5], [9]. Di\u000berent derivations may lead to very di\u000berent behavior of the movement. For\nexample, when the discrete population model of [9] is considered: one can show that cells can\n\u0003School of Mathematics, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, P. R.

But in [5], cells will move\ntoward low-density and \ree otherwise. Usually, the cells are considered to be points which\nmove on a lattice according to certain rules. These rules can be modi\fed according to the\nstates of neighboring points, such as the density of the neighboring points [5] or the volume and\nadhesion of the neighboring points [1], [3]. Individual based models have found useful application\nto many physical systems and even simple rules of interaction can give rise to remarkably\ncomplex behavior. In particular, individual-based models have found applications in ecology,\npattern formation, wound healing, tumor growth and gastrulation and vasculogenesis in the\nearly embryo, amongst many others.\nContinuous models frequently involve the development of a reaction-di\u000busion equation [5].\nThese are useful when the length scale over which we wish to investigate the phenomenon is much\ngreater than the diameter of the individual elements composing it. These models have been found\nto be particularly useful in the study of pattern formation in nature, especially the phenomenon\nof \"di\u000busion driven instability\" [1], [3], [5], [9]. The application of hybrid models - where cells\nare models as discrete entities with their movements being in\ruenced by continuous spatial \felds\n- has also been found to be a useful approach [6]. Discrete and continuous approaches to the\nmodeling of cell migration developed by Bao and Zhou [5] via biased random walk will be under\ninvestigated in the present paper.\nIf we consider both a continuous and discrete models of the same phenomenon, we would\nexpect the models to give rise to similar solutions properties at length scales where their ranges\nof applicability overlap. If the solutions' behaviors are totally di\u000berent, we should track their\ndi\u000berences and \fnd reasons in the original modeling.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we consider the discrete model of\nbiological cell movement and shown how it can be used to obtain an expression for the continuous\naggregation di\u000busion model. Section 3 considers the existence and nonexistence of weak solution\nof the continuous models. Section 4 focuses on the analysis of the discrete model. Section 5\ndiscusses the asymptotic behaviors of special case when N\u00144 and some open problems.\n2 Discrete and Continuous Models\nRecall the biological cell movement model [5]. By the need for survival, mating or to overcome\nthe hostile environment, the population have the tendency of aggregation when the population\ndensity is small and di\u000busion otherwise. For simplicity, here we consider one species living in\na one-dimensional habitat without birth term. To derive the model we follow a biased random\nwalk approach plus a di\u000busion approximation. First we discretize space in a regular manner.\nLethbe the distance between two successive points of the mesh and let u(x;t) be the population\ndensity that any individual of the population is at the point xand at time t. By scaling, we can\nassume that 0\u0014u(x;t)\u00141. During a time period \u001can individual which at time tand at the\npositionx, can either:\n1.move to the right of xto the point x+h, with probability R(x;t);or\n2.move to the left of xto the point x\u0000h, with probability L(x;t) or\n3.stay at the position x, with probability N(x;t):\n2Figure 1: Movement of population\nAssume that there are no other possibilities of movement we have\nN(x;t) +R(x;t) +L(x;t) = 1:\nWe assume that\nR(x;t) =K(u(x+h;t));\nL(x;t) =K(u(x\u0000h;t)):\nHere we let K(u(x;t)) measures the probability of movement which depend on the population.\nUsing the notations above, the density u(x;t) can be written as follows:\nu(x;t+\u001c) =N(x;t)u(x;t) +R(x\u0000h;t)u(x\u0000h;t) +L(x+h;t)u(x+h;t): (2.1)\nBy using Taylor series, we obtain the following approximation\nu(x;t) +\u001cdu\ndt=N(x;t)u(x;t) +fR(x;t)u(x;t)\u0000hd(Ru)\ndx+h2\n2d2(Ru)\ndx2g\n+fL(x;t)u(x;t) +hd(Lu)\ndx+h2\n2d2(Lu)\ndx2g;\nthen we get\n\u001cdu\ndt=f\u0000hd(Ru)\ndx+h2\n2d2(Ru)\ndx2g+fhd(Lu)\ndx+h2\n2d2(Lu)\ndx2g:\nSet\n\f(x;t) =R(x;t)\u0000L(x;t) =K(u(x+h;t))\u0000K(u(x\u0000h;t)) = 2hd\ndx[K(u(x;t)] +O(h3)\nand\n\u0017(x;t) =R(x;t) +L(x;t) =K(u(x+h;t)) +K(u(x\u0000h;t)) = 2K(u(x;t)) +O(h2):\nWe can get\n\u001cdu\ndt=\u0000hd[(R\u0000L)u]\ndx+h2\n2d2[(R+L)u]\nd2x:\nNow we substitute \fand\u0017in the above equation, we can get\n\u001cdu\ndt=\u00002h2dfd\ndx[K(u(x;t)]ug\ndx+h2\n2d2[2K(u(x;t))u]\nd2x+O(h3):\n3We assume that h2=\u001c!C > 0 (\fnite) as \u001c;h!0, we get the following\ndu\ndt=\u00002Cdfd\ndx[K(u(x;t)]ug\ndx+Cd2[K(u(x;t))u]\nd2x;\ndu\ndt=Cf\u00002d\ndx[K(u(x;t)]u+d[K(u(x;t))u]\ndxgx;\ndu\ndt=C(\u00002K0uxu+K0uxu+Kux)x=C[(K\u0000uK0)ux]x:\nWhen higher order terms are kept, which will lead to the following\nut+\u001cutt= ((K\u0000uK0)ux)x+h2\n12[uxxxxK\u0000ud4\ndx4(K(u))]; (2.2)\nthe coe\u000ecient for the high order term uxxxx is (K\u0000uK0) which is the same as the di\u000busion\ncoe\u000ecient for ux. Comparing to the standard Cahn-Hilliad equation or Cahn-Hilliad equation\nwith degenerate mobility coe\u000ecient, our new equation (2.2) is totally new and the existence or\nnonexistence of the weak solution is still an open question.\nIf we letK(u(x;t)) = 1=2(u2\u0000u3), we can test that 0 \u0014K(u(x;t))\u00141 which satis\fes the\nassumption of probability and that K\u0000uK0=u2(u\u00001=2), which means aggregation when\n0\u0014u<1=2. By plugging this probability in Equation (2.1), and we denote the discrete density\nu(x;t) =ut\nj;u(x\u0000h;t) =ut\nj\u00001;u(x+h;t) =ut\nj+1;::: we have:\nut+\u001c\nj=ut\nj+ut\njut\nj\u00001\n2(ut\nj+ut\nj\u00001\u00001)(ut\nj\u00001\u0000ut\nj) +ut\njut\nj+1\n2(ut\nj+ut\nj+1\u00001)(ut\nj+1\u0000ut\nj);(2.3)\nwhich is a special \fnite di\u000berence scheme of the following backward forward parabolic equation:\nut= [D(u)ux]x(x;t)2QT; (2.4)\nwhereQT:= [0;1]\u0002[0;T],\nD(u)<0 in (0;\u000b); D (u)>0 in (\u000b;1): (2.5)\n3 Regularity and Properties of the Continuous Model\nIn this section, we \frst give the de\fnition of a weak solution of Equation (2.4) with D(u) always\nsatis\fes Equation (2.5) and non-\rux condition.\nDe\fnition 3.1. A locally continuous function u(x;t)will be said to be a weak solution of the\nbackward forward Equation (2.4) with non-\rux condition if\nZ1\n0u2(x;t) +jD(u)ju2\nxdx (3.1)\nis uniformly bounded for t2[0;T]and if for any test function \u001e(x;t)inC1\n0[QT],\nZ Z\n[u\u001et\u0000D(u)ux\u001ex]dxdt = 0: (3.2)\n4We \frst establish the \frst derivative estimates. For simplicity, we limit ourselves to showing\nhow to obtain an a priori estimate. For any point ( x0;t0) such that u(x0;t0)> \u000b, there is a\n\u000e >0 such that D(u)>c> 0 for (x;t)2eQ\u000e= [x1;x1+\u000e]\u0002[t0;t0+\u000e] and (x0;t0)2eQ\u000e. We\nestimate\nZ Z\n\u0011(x)2u2\nxdxdt;\nwhere the cut-o\u000b function \u0011(x) is smooth and vanishes outside [ x1;x1+\u000e]. Di\u000berentiating the\nequation with respect to tand multiplying by \u00112u(if not di\u000berentiable, we use the smoothing\noperator to u(x;t)), we \fnd\n1\n2d\ndtZ\n\u00112u2dx=Z\n\u00112utudx=\u0000Z\nD(u)ux(\u00112u)xdx\n=Z\n\u0000[D(u)\u00112u2\nx+ 2D(u)\u0011\u0011xuxu]dx;\nSo, integrating with respect to time and using Young inequality,\ncZ Z\n\u00112u2\nxdxdt\u0014C+Z Z\n2D(u)[\u000f\u00112u2\nx+ (C=\u000f)\u00112\nxu2]dxdt;\nfor some constant C and for every \u000f. By taking \u000fsmall enough, we can get the \frst derivative\nestimate. Because uis locallyH1inx,D(u) is strictly positive, by Nash-Moser estimate we can\ngetu2C\u000b1;\u000b1=2;then according to Ladyzenskaya et al [18]. [Chapter V, Theorem 7.4], we can\ngetu2C1+\u000b1;\u000b1=2:\nC2+\u000b2estimate. Once we get the C1+\u000b1;\u000b1=2estimate, going back to our Equation (2.4), we\nhave estimated that the equation for uhas Holder continuous coe\u000ecients. If we view it as a\nlinear equation, di\u000berentiating the equation, we now have\nuxt= (D(u)ux)xx;\n= [D(u)uxx+D0(u)uxux]x:\nIf we letv=ux, we get\nvt= [D(u)vx]x+ [D0(u)ux]xv+ [D0(u)ux]vx;\nwhich is a uniformly forward parabolic equation for v. By using Schauder estimate, we can\nconclude that uxis locallyC2+\u000b2;1+\u000b2=2for some\u000b22(0;1):\nHigher derivative estimates. Once C2+\u000b2;1+\u000b2=2estimates have been found, it is easy to\nderive interior estimates for higher-order derivatives. For instance, we may now di\u000berentiate the\nequation once more to \fnd an equation for uxx:\nuxxt\u0000[D(u)uxx+D0(u)u2\nx]xx= 0;\nwhich hasHolder continuous coe\u000ecients. Therefore, we conclude that uxxis locallyC2+\u000b2;1+\u000b2=2,\nwhich gives a fourth derivative estimate. The procedure is easily iterated and continues to in-\n\fnitum given D(s) is in\fnitely di\u000berentiable.\nFrom above estimate, we can get the following theorem for these big enough initial data.\n5Theorem 3.1. Suppose that D(u)satis\fes (2.5) . Then there exists a nonnegative classical\nsolution in C2;1(QT)of Problem (2.4) for allT > 0, provided\u000b < u (x;0)2C1;\f([0;1]);\f2\n(0;1);and satis\fes the non-\rux conditions D(u)ux(0;t) =D(u)ux(1;t) = 0 .\nFurthermore, when u0\u0015\u000ba.e. on [0;1], we have the following asymptotic theorem\nTheorem 3.2. Supposeu0\u0015\u000b;u02C1;\f[0;1], andu(x;t)is the solution of Equation (2.4)\nwith non-\rux boundary condition, then solution u(x;t)will go to constant C=R1\n0u(x;0)dx.\nProof. First from the above estimate, we can see u(x;t) is in\fnitely di\u000berentiable given u(x;0)>\n\u000ba.e. on [0;1]. So we have\nd\ndtZ1\n0udx=Z1\n0utdx=Z1\n0(D(u)ux)xdx=D(u)uxj1\n0= 0; (3.3)\nwhich gives the result of conservation of the total density.\nWhenu(x;0)> \u000b a.e. in [0;1], we can have D(u)>0 by using the maximum principle of\nparabolic equation. Even more we can have u(x;t)\u0015\u000b+\u000e1for some small number \u000e1andt>0.\nd\ndtZ1\n0u2dx= 2Z1\n0uutdx= 2Z1\n0u(D(u)ux)xdx=\u00002Z1\n0D(u)u2\nxdx\u00140; (3.4)\nwhich means the \"energy\" of the solution is decreasing.\nThe last step we prove the solution will attend the constant Cas timetgoes to in\fnity.\nd\ndtZ1\n0(u\u0000C)2dx= 2Z1\n0(u\u0000C)utdx= 2Z1\n0(u\u0000C)[D(u)ux]xdx\n=\u00002Z1\n0(u\u0000C)xD(u)uxdx\u0014\u00002\u000eZ1\n0(u\u0000C)2\nxdx\n\u0014 \u0000 2\u000ecZ1\n0(u\u0000C)2dx (By using Poincar\u0013 einequality):\nThen by using Gronwall's inequality, we can get\nZ1\n0(u\u0000C)2dx\u0014(Z1\n0(u0\u0000C)2dx)e\u00002\u000ect: (3.5)\nLett!+1;we can getR1\n0(u\u0000C)2dx= 0 a.e., by combining uis locally continuous, we obtain\nlimt!+1u(x;t) =C.\nThe proof of u\u0000\u000b\u0015\u000e>0 for allt>0.

We show that k-(\r;\u0016)-choosable for bipartite graphs and\nouterplanar graphs (in Section 3) and further, we show that a graph with a\nk-coloring has a k-(\r;\u0016)-choosable, which strengthens the results.\n2. Algorithms for choosability in graphs\nGiven a graph Gand a setL(v) of colors for each vertex v, a list of allowed\ncolors, a list coloring of Gis a choice function that maps every vertex vto a\ncolor in the list L(v). As with vertex coloring problem, a list coloring is generally\nassumed to be proper, meaning no two adjacent vertices receive the same color.\nThus, a graph is k-choosable (or k-list-colorable) if it has a proper list coloring\nno matter how one assigns a list of kcolors to each vertex. The choice number\n(or list chromatic number), denoted by \u001f`(G), is the least number ksuch that\nGisk-choosable. A more general case is the f-choosability. Given a function\nfof assigning a positive integer f(v) to each vertex v, a graphG= (V;E) isf-\nchoosable (or f-list-colorable) if it has a list coloring no matter how one assigns\na list off(v) colors to each vertex v. A particular case happens when f(v) =k,\nfor all vertices v2V(G), whenf-choosability corresponds to k-choosability.\n22.1. Computational complexity for the k-choosability\nThek-choosability of a graph Gis one of the few problems known to be \u0005P\n2-\ncomplete and this gives the fact that there is an exponential number of possible\ncolor lists with arbitrary and not necessarily consecutive values, of certain size\n(details of \u0005P\n2-complete in [9]). Thus, to determine the k-choosability, we have\nto generate all possible instances with lists of size k, that is, to check for each\npossible distribution of color lists of size kto the vertices, an arrangement with\nrepetition. If for a given instance of size kof color lists, there is no solution, then,\nwe repeat the process for color lists of size k+ 1 until the property is satis\fed.\nThe aim is to determine the smallest kfor which we have a list coloring for all\npossible instances. An algorithm for k-choosable enumerates all color lists of\nsizekto check if the graph is colorable for all these lists. The solutions are\nformed by the color lists, taken nbyn, with repeated elements (see Algorithm\n1).\nAlgorithm 1: Isk-choosable( G= (V;E);k)\n1X \u0000n\nk\u0001\n2Px alln-permutations of Xwith repeated elements;\n3forL2Pxdo\n4 if!(Exists List Coloring(G;L;not; 1))then\n5 Return NOT\n6Return YES\nThe previous algorithm uses another algorithm for list coloring problem be-\ncause it needs to check in each solution whether they have a valid color list (see\nAlgorithm 2). The algorithm is exponential time, that is, it checks in a graph\nGwith lists of colors assigned to its vertices all the possibilities of having a col-\noration. If not, the algorithm will attempt this check with the next set of color\nlists until there are no more sets to be tested. Thus, this process is a for all lists\n\"there exists\" a feasible solution, which con\fgures the case of a \u0005P\n2-complete\nproblem.\nAlgorithm 2: Exists ListColoring(G;L; &exists;i )\n1ifnot exists then\n2 ifL=?then\n3 ifExistsColoring( G)then\n4 exists YES\n5 else\n6l \u0000remove the \frst on the list L\n7 forcolor2ldo\n8 G:vi:cor \u0000color\n9 ListColoring(G;L;exists;i + 1)\n10 ifexists then\n11 Break\n32.2. Additional results applying methods of proof in choosability in graphs\nThe work of Woodall [22] presents a survey with the main methods of choos-\nability in graphs. These proof methods can be divided into methods that involve\ndigraphs (Alon Tarsi method and kernel's method) and do not involve digraphs\n(degeneracy in graphs, the method of Hall's theorem and boundary method).\nThe method of Alon and Tarsi was introduced by Alon and Tarsi [1]. The au-\nthors using the polynomial graph technique in their proofs. This method is used\nby Alon and Tarsi to prove that every planar bipartite graph is 3-choosable. The\nkernel's method was introduced by Galvin [10].\nThe method of degeneracy in graphs is used in some cases of choosability.\nA graphGis calledk-degenerate if every subgraph HofGcontains a vertex\nwith degree (in H) at mostk. This method is used to show that every planar\ngraph is 6-choosable and every triangle-free planar graph are 4-choosable [17].\nThe method of Hall's theorem [13] of the theorem on systems of distinct rep-\nresentatives. This method is used to show that the complete k-partite graph\nK2;2;:::;2isk-choosable [2]. Let Sbe a family of \fnite sets S1;S2;:::;S m, a\nsystem of distinct representatives is a set x1;x2;:::;x msuch thatxi2Si;8i\nwherexi6=xj;8i6=j. A family of sets S1;S2;:::;S msystem has a di\u000berent\nrepresentatives if and only if for any subset I\u0012f1;2;:::;mgcondition is true\nj[\ni2ISij\u0015jIj\nThe boundary method [19], de\fne the boundary to comprise those uncolored\nvertices ofGthat are adjacent to colored vertices. This method was introduced\nin Thomassen's famous article [19] and was used to show that any planar graph\nis 5-choosable. For more results of choosability in planar graphs see [4, 18, 23].\n3. Thek-(\r;\u0016)-choosability\nWe correlate k-choosability with ( \r;\u0016)-coloring. A graph Gisk-(\r;\u0016)-\nchoosable or k-(\r;\u0016)-list-colorable, if Gis (\r;\u0016)-colorable for each set L(V)\nof color lists of each v2V(G), such thatjL(v)j\u0015kto each vertex v, and\nthe lists are the type ( \r;\u0016). Application of the proof methods presented in\nthe Section 2.2. The application will be in k-(\r,\u0016)-coloring for bipartite and\nouterplanar graphs.\nTheorem 3.1. Every outerplanar graph is 3-(\r,\u0016)-choosable.\nProof. LetG=K1. This graph has no edges and is trivially outerplanar and\n3-(\r,\u0016)-choosable. Assuming that every outerplanar graph with n vertices is\n3-(\r,\u0016)-choosable, it will be shown that the coloring list is also valid for an\nouterplanar graph Gn+1withn+ 1 vertices and with a distribution of color\nlists in its vertices of type ( \r,\u0016) of size 3. There exists a vertex v2Gn+1with\ndegree up to maximum 2. Removing this vertex, we have a subgraph Gnwith\nnvertices [5]. Since Gn+1can be drawn with its vertices in the form of a cycle\nwith chord without crosses, the subgraph can also be drawn in this way. This\n4implies that Gnhas a color list with lists of type ( \r,\u0016) of size 3. Color the\nvertices of Gn+1with 3 or more colors. Since the vertices adjacent to vertex\nvof degree at maximum 2 are already colored, consider two cases: Case one:\nThe vertex vhas degree one. In this case, the vertex vreceives a color from the\nlist of colors and the adjacent vertex receives another color. Since the list color\nhas size three, one color will remain. Case two: The vertex vhas degree two.\nThe vertex vwill receive a third color from its list of that is di\u000berent from its\nadjacent ones. And so the demonstration is valid.\nFor the next theorem, Hall's method will be applied. To show that a com-\nplete bipartite graph is 2-( \r,\u0016)-choosable, let's \frst show two cases: when the\nsubgraph of a bipartite graph has equal lists color among its partitions and\nwhen all the lists color are di\u000berent.\nLemma 3.1. Consider the complete bipartite graph Kn;n=G[V;W ]forn\u00151\nwith partitions V=fv1;:::;v ng,W=fw1;:::;w ngand a distribution lists\n(\r;\u0016)of size 2,L(v)for allv2Kn;nsuch thatL(vi)6=L(vj)ifi6=j, is\nL(vi) =L(wi)for alli= 1;:::;n . Then with these lists, Kn;nis2-(\r;\u0016)-list-\ncolorable.\nProof. Consider a Kn;ngraph where the color lists of type ( \r;\u0016) that occur in\none partition also occur in the other partition, see Figure 1. For n= 1, the\ngraphK1;1has two vertices v1andw1andL(v1) =L(w1) =f1;2g. Suppose\nnow that the theorem holds for Kn;n, wheren\u00151 and then holds for Kn+1;n+1.\nWithout loss of generality, assume that the lists L(vi) =\ri;\ri+1are distributed\nat the vertices such that \r1<\r2<:::<\r n+1.\nfa;a + 1g\nfa;a + 1g fb;b+ 1gfb;b+ 1g f\rn;\rn+ 1g\nf\rn;\rn+ 1g f\rn+1;\rn+1+ 1gf\rn+1;\rn+1+ 1g\n::::::\nv1 v2\nw1 w2: : :\n: : :vn\nwnwn+1vn+1\nFigure 1: Example of a complete bipartite graph with the color lists of partition V=\nfv1;:::;vngequal to the partition W=fw1;:::;wngof type (\r;\u0016) of size two.\nConsider the complete subgraph of Kn;nobtained by the vertices v1;v2;:::;v n\nandw1;w2;:::;w n. By induction hypothesis there is a list coloration for this\nKn;n. Coloring is missing vertices vn+1andwn+1. In the worst case \rn+1=\n\rn+1 since\rn<\rn+1and the lists are in sequence. In this case, if \rn+1=\rn+1,\nwithout loss of generality, assume that color chosen for the vertex vnwas\rn\nand for the vertex wnwas\rn+ 1. Then the vertex vn+1will be colored with\nthe color\rn+1+ 1 and the vertex wn+1with the color \rn+1.\n5Lemma 3.2. Consider the complete bipartite graph Kn;n=G[V;W ]forn\u00151\nwith partitions V=fv1;:::;v ng,W=fw1;:::;w ngand a distribution lists\n(\r;\u0016)of size 2,L(v)for allv2Kn;nsuch thatL(vi)6=L(wj)for alli;j=\n1;:::;n . Then with these lists, Kn;nis2-(\r;\u0016)-list-colorable.\nProof. Consider in partition Vonly the di\u000berent lists S1;S2;:::;S rand in par-\ntitionWonly the di\u000berent lists Sr+1;Sr+2;:::;S r+t. Thus, we have to Si6=Sj,\nfori6=j, and since they are lists ( \r;\u0016) of size 2, the intersection of any two of\nthese lists have at most one element.\nfa;a + 1g\nfc;c+ 1g fd;d + 1gfb;b+ 1g f\rn;\rn+ 1g\nf\rn;\rn+ 1gf\rn+1;\rn+1+ 1gf\rn+1;\rn+1+ 1g\n::::::\nv1 v2\nw1 w2: : :\n: : :vn\nwnwn+1vn+1\nFigure 2: Example of a complete bipartite graph with all lists of di\u000berent colors and of type\n(\r;\u0016) of size two.\nThus, these Sisets ful\fll Hall's theorem and thus we obtain elements di\u000ber-\nentci2Si, withci6=cj. Then we color a vertex v2Kn;n with the color ciif\nL(v) =Si, and thus we have a color list of Kn;n .\nTheorem 3.2. TheKn;nis2-(\r,\u0016)-choosable.\nProof.

Clearly some\nof these lists may appear in more than one vertex in each partition, but will\ntake just a list representative in her case appear more than once in the same\npartition. Thus, consider the sets S1;S2;:::;S r(r\u0014n), which are the lists that\noccur while vertices of VandW, and how we choose only one representative in\nthe event of repetition in the partition, we have Si6=Sj, fori6=j.

Conclusions\nA (\r;\u0016)-coloring is a graph coloring problem that has been studied fre-\nquently in recent years. It has a real-world application in an interesting and\nwell-studied way: the channel assignment problems [6]. The correlation be-\ntween (\r,\u0016)-coloring and choosability in graphs was very interesting because\n7in this case, the choosability stopped being \u0005P\n2-complete to be NP-complete.\nThe use of methods of proof used for choosability in some classes of graphs is\ninteresting in the sense of presenting the diversity of forms of solutions to this\nproblem. The goal is to continue working with ( \r;\u0016)-coloring on other forms of\ncomplexity.

Burton and Stephan Tillmann\nAbstract We present a practical algorithm to test whether a 3{manifold given by a triangulation or\nan ideal triangulation contains a closed essential surface. This property has important theoretical and\nalgorithmic consequences. As a testament to its practicality, we run the algorithm over a comprehensive\nbody of closed 3{manifolds and knot exteriors, yielding results that were not previously known.\nThe algorithm derives from the original Jaco-Oertel framework, involves both enumeration and op-\ntimisation procedures, and combines several techniques from normal surface theory. Our methods\nare relevant for other di\u000ecult computational problems in 3-manifold theory, such as the recognition\nproblem for knots, links and 3{manifolds.\nAMS Classi\fcation 57M25, 57N10\nKeywords 3-manifold, knot, normal surface, essential surface, incompressible surface, algorithm\n1 Introduction\nIn the study of 3{manifolds, essential surfaces have been of central importance since Haken's\nseminal work in the 1960s. An essential surface may be regarded as `topologically minimal',\nand there has since been extensive research into 3{manifolds, called Haken 3{manifolds , that\ncontain an essential surface. The existence of such a surface has profound consequences for\nboth the topology and geometry of a 3{manifold [9, 12, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 28].\nGiven any closed 3{manifold, speci\fed by a handle decomposition or triangulation, it is a\ntheorem of Jaco and Oertel [15] from 1984 that one may algorithmically test for the existence of\na closed essential surface. However, their algorithm has signi\fcant intricacies and is of doubly-\nexponential complexity in terms of the input size. One of the key messages of this paper is\nthat this need not be a deterrent: with the right heuristics and careful algorithm engineering,\ntheoretically intractable problems such as this can be implemented and automated over large\nsets of data.\nThe issue of iterated-exponential complexity, coming from cutting and re-triangulating, arises\nwith ubiquity when considering objects called normal hierarchies . These hierarchies are key\nwhen solving more di\u000ecult problems (such as the homeomorphism problem) via Haken's ap-\nproach. Our strategy in this paper is both fast in practice and always correct and conclusive,\nindicating that, despite their iterated-exponential time complexities, practical implementa-\ntions of these more di\u000ecult algorithms might indeed be possible.\nIn the remainder of this introduction, we give a summary of the theoretical results ( x1.1), an\noverview of the algorithms ( x1.2), and a summary of the computational results ( x1.3).\n1arXiv:1812.11686v1  [math.GT]  31 Dec 20181.1 Summary of the theoretical results\nIn the short conference paper [5] written with Alexander Coward, we outlined a practical\nimplementation of the Jaco-Oertel framework for the case of \fnding a closed essential surface\nin a knot exterior in S3;speci\fed by an ideal triangulation. There, we introduced the bare\nminimum of the new theory and algorithms required for this application, not including full\nproofs of many of the results stated. In this paper, we generalise our results and algorithms to\ntriangulations of closed, irreducible, orientable 3{manifolds and to ideal triangulations of the\ninteriors of compact, irreducible and @{irreducible, orientable 3{manifolds with non-empty\nboundary. We thank Alexander Coward for his contributions in the early stages of this project.\nWe base our work on the framework of the Jaco-Oertel algorithm for testing for closed incom-\npressible surfaces. This uses normal surfaces , which allow us to translate topological questions\nabout surfaces into the setting of integer and linear programming. The framework consists\nof two stages: the \frst constructs a \fnite list of candidate essential surfaces, and the second\ntests each surface in the list to see if it is essential.\nFor the \frst stage (enumerating candidate essential surfaces), we combine several techniques.\nFirst, we wish to create a triangulation for each manifold that contains as few tetrahedra as\npossible. This is achieved for closed 3{manifolds through the use of singular triangulations\ninstead of simplicial ones. For compact manifolds with non-empty boundary we use ideal\ntriangulations , which are decompositions of the interiors of these spaces into tetrahedra with\ntheir vertices removed. Ideal triangulations introduce some theoretical di\u000eculties, but they\nare much smaller with roughly half as many tetrahedra.\nSecond, we use a variant of normal surface theory based on quadrilateral coordinates . Instead\nof the standard coordinates for normal surfaces involving four triangles and three quadrilater-\nals per tetrahedron, we work in the more e\u000ecient coordinate system only using the quadrilat-\neral coordinates. These coordinates were known to Thurston and Jaco in the 1980s, and \frst\nappeared in print in work of Tollefson [27]. In an ideal triangulation Twith non-spherical\nvertex links, this coordinate system encodes both closed normal surfaces and spun-normal\nsurfaces, which are properly embedded and non-compact. The coordinate x(F) of a closed\nnormal surface Fin this spun-normal surface cone Q(T) lies in its intersection Q0(T) with\na subspace corresponding to the kernel of a boundary map (seex3.1). The following result,\nproven inx3.2, is based on the seminal work of Jaco and Oertel [15] and provides our \f-\nnite, constructible set of candidate surfaces. An analogous result was proven by Tollefson for\nsimplicial triangulations of closed 3{manifolds.\nTheorem 5 SupposeMis the interior of an irreducible and @{irreducible, compact, ori-\nentable 3{manifold with non-empty boundary, and let Tbe an ideal triangulation of M:If\nMcontains a closed, essential surface S;then there is a normal, closed essential surface F\nwith the property that x(F)lies on an extremal ray of Q0(T):\nMoreover, if \u001f(S)<0, then there is such Fwith\u001f(F)<0. If, in addition, the link of each\nvertex has zero Euler characteristic, then if \u001f(S) = 0 , then there is such Fwith\u001f(F) = 0:\nWe also state Tollefon's theorem for closed manifolds in the context of singular triangulations\nas Theorem 4, and give a uni\fed proof for both theorems.\n2The example inx3.3 of a triangulation TMof a trivial circle bundle over a once-punctured\nsurface of genus two shows that our approach in Theorem 5 is optimal in the following sense.\nAlgorithms involving normal surfaces need to reduce the search space to a \fnite constructible\nset of solutions in a cone. Typically, one chooses the set of extremal or the set of fundamental\nsolutions. All fundamental solutions of Q(TM) are extremal, and they are either spun-normal\nsurfaces or so-called thin-edge links , that is, closed surfaces that after one compression give a\nboundary parallel torus. In particular, no essential torus is amongst the fundamental solutions\ninQ(TM):Hence it is necessary to consider the space Q0(TM):We thank Mark Bell for\ncreatingTMfor us with flipper [1].\n1.2 Overview of the algorithms\nWe describe our algorithms to decide the existence of closed essential surfaces in x4. A\nkey di\u000eculty with the Jaco-Oertel framework, which our algorithms also inherit, is that\nboth stages have running times that are worst-case exponential in their respective input\nsizes. Moreover, the output of the \frst stage (enumerating candidate essential surfaces) is\nexponential in its input, and this then becomes the input to the second stage (testing whether\na candidate surface is essential). This means that combining the two stages in any obvious\nway leads to a doubly-exponential time complexity solution.\nDespite this signi\fcant hurdle, we introduce several innovations that cut down the running\ntime enormously for both stages. Our optimisation for the \frst stage involves a combination\nof established techniques that, though well understood individually, require new ideas and\ntheory in order to work harmoniously together. For the second stage we combine branch-and-\nbound techniques from integer programming with the Jaco-Rubinstein procedure for crushing\nsurfaces within triangulations, extending recent work of the \frst author and Ozlen [6].\nThe innovations for the second stage (testing whether a candidate surface is essential) are of\nparticular signi\fcance, since there has never before been a systematic algorithm for testing\nwhether a candidate surface is essential that is both practical and always conclusive. Here,\nthe Jaco-Oertel approach cuts along each candidate surface and inspects the boundary of\nthe resulting 3{manifold to see if it admits a compression disc (such a disc certi\fes that\na surface is non-essential). The key di\u000eculty is that one requires a new triangulation for\nthe cut-open 3{manifold: since the candidate surface may be very complicated, any natural\nscheme for cutting and re-triangulating yields a new triangulation with exponentially many\ntetrahedra in the worst case, taking us far beyond the realm in which normal surface theory\nhas traditionally been feasible in practice. Since these new triangulations are the input for\nstage two, which is itself exponential time, we now see where the double exponential arises,\nand why the Jaco-Oertel framework has long been considered far from practical.\nWe resolve this signi\fcant problem using a blend of techniques. First, we use strong simpli-\n\fcation heuristics to reduce the number of tetrahedra. Next, we replace the traditional (and\nvery expensive) enumeration-based search for compression discs with an optimisation process\nthat maximises Euler characteristic. This uses the branch-and-bound techniques of [6], and\nallows us to quickly focus on a single candidate compression disc. We employ the crushing\ntechniques of Jaco and Rubinstein [16] to quickly test whether this is indeed a compression\ndisc, and (crucially) to reduce the size of the triangulation if it is not.\n31.3 Summary of the computational results\nIn this paper we present a practical algorithm that, though still doubly-exponential in theory,\nis able to systematically test a signi\fcant class of 3{manifolds for the existence of a closed\nessential surface, and is both e\u000ecient in practice and always conclusive. To illustrate its\npower, we run this algorithm over a comprehensive body of input data, yielding computer\nproofs of new mathematical results.\nFigure 1: Haken manifolds in the Hodgson-Weeks census\nWe \frst consider the Hodgson-Weeks census, which contains 11,031 closed, orientable 3{\nmanifolds. This is an approximation to the set of all hyperbolic 3{manifolds of volume \u00146:5\nand length of shortest geodesic \u00150:15:The number of tetrahedra ranges from 9 to 32. The\n\frst step in our algorithm is to check whether the existence of a closed essential surfaces\nalready follows from the fact that the \frst Betti number is positive. Only 132 of the census\nmanifolds (\u00181%) have positive Betti number, and hence are Haken for this reason. Dun\feld\nused an implementation of the Jaco-Oertel algorithm in 1999 to compute that only 15 of the\n\frst 246 census manifolds (246/15 \u00186%) are Haken. Our computation gave the surprising\nresult that the percentage of Haken manifolds in the Hodgson-Weeks census is about 21%,\nsee Figure 1. Further analysis of the computation is given in x6.1.\n# knots (cumulative)015,00030,00045,00060,000\nVolume051015202530\n(a) Cumulative number of knots by volume\n% large (cumulative)\n0255075100\n# knots (ordered by volume)015,00030,00045,00060,000\n (b) Cumulative percentage of large knots\nFigure 2: Percentage of large knots by volume\n4The next census we consider is the census of all knots in the 3{sphere with at most 14\ncrossings due to Hoste-Thistlethwaite-Weeks [14]. The authors thank Morwen Thistlethwaite\nfor sharing these data with them, sorted into torus knots, satellite knots and hyperbolic\nknots. There are 59,924 hyperbolic knots with at most 14 crossings, and the number of ideal\ntetrahedra used to triangulate their complements ranges from 2 to 33. In this case, any closed\nessential surface is separating, and thus the algorithmic detection allows no shortcuts via\nhomology arguments. Our computation showed that 31,805 ( \u001853%) of the hyperbolic knot\ncomplements contain closed essential surfaces (we call these large knots for brevity). Figure 2\nshows a cumulative plot of the percentage, where the knots in the census are ordered by\nvolume. Further analysis of the computation is given in x6.2.\nTestament to the improvement in algorithm design is the fact that Regina [4] can certify the\nWeber-Seifert dodecahedral space to be non-Haken out of the box in under 75 minutes on a\n2016 MacBook Pro with a 3.1 GHz Intel Core i5 processor and 16 GB of 2133 MHz memory.\nThis was a computational challenge due to Thurston when it was \frst solved in 2012 [8]. We\ncaution the reader that running times are subject to random seeds and can vary signi\fcantly.\n2 Preliminaries\nIn this section, we collect the following well-known de\fnitions and results: singular (possibly\nideal) triangulations ( x2.1); essential surfaces ( x2.2); a homology criterion for existence of\nclosed essential surfaces ( x2.3); normal surface theory via quadrilateral coordinates ( x2.4);\nreduced form for Haken sums ( x2.5); the Jaco-Rubinstein method of crushing of triangulations\n(x2.6).\n2.1 Triangulations\nThe notation of [16] and [26] will be used in this paper. A (singular) triangulation ,T;of a\ncompact 3{manifold Mconsists of a union of pairwise disjoint 3{simplices, e\u0001 =\u001b1[:::[\u001bt;a\nset of face pairings, \b ;and a homeomorphism h:e\u0001=\b!M:We thus make the identi\fcation\ne\u0001=\b =Mand there is a natural quotient map p:e\u0001!e\u0001=\b =M:The quotient map is\ninjective on the interior of each 3{simplex. We refer to the image of a 3{simplex in Mas a\ntetrahedron and to itsfaces, edges and vertices with respect to the pre-image. Similarly for\nimages of 2{, 1{ and 0{simplices, which will be referred to as faces ,edges and vertices inM\nrespectively. If an edge is contained in @M; then it is termed a boundary edge ; otherwise it\nis an interior edge .\nIfMis the interior of a compact manifold with non-empty boundary, an ideal triangulation ,\nT;ofMconsists of a union of pairwise disjoint 3{simplices, e\u0001;a set of face pairings, \b ;a\nnatural quotient map p:e\u0001!e\u0001=\b =P;and a homeomorphism h:PnP(0)!M;between\nMand the complement of the 0{skeleton in P:The quotient space Pis usually called a\npseudo-manifold and referred to as the end-compacti\fcation ofM:\nFor brevity, we will refer to a 3{manifold Mimbued with a (possibly ideal) triangulation\nT= (e\u0001;\b;h) as a triangulated 3{manifold . Throughout, we will assume that Misoriented ,\nthat all tetrahedra in Mare oriented coherently and the tetrahedra in e\u0001 are given the induced\norientation.\n52.2 Surfaces in 3-manifolds\nThe following de\fnition of an essential surface, along with an extensive discussion of their\nproperties, can be found in Shalen [24], x1.5.\nDe\fnition 1 (Essential surface) A properly embedded surface Sin the compact, irre-\nducible, orientable 3{manifold Misessential if it has the following properties:\n(1)Sis bicollared;\n(2) the inclusion homomorphism \u00191(Si)!\u00191(M) is injective for each component SiofS;\n(3) no component of Sis a 2{sphere;\n(4) no component of Sis boundary parallel; and\n(5)Sis non-empty.\nOf interest to this paper is the following geometric interpretation of the second property, see\nShalen [24] for more details. A compression disc for the surface Sis a discD\u001aMsuch\nthatD\\S=@Dand@Dis homotopically non-trivial in S(i.e. does not bound a disc on\nS). In particular, if Shas a compression disc, then \u00191(Si)!\u00191(M) is not injective for some\ncomponent of S:It follows from classical work of Papakyriakopoulos that the converse is also\ntrue. Detecting compression discs is the topic of Section 4.\n2.3 Closed essential surfaces from homology\nIn this paper, we are interested in closed essential surfaces in a compact, irreducible, orientable\n3{manifold M(given by a triangulation). The universal coe\u000ecients theorem and Poincar\u0013 e\nduality give a natural isomorphism H1(M;Z)\u0018=H2(M;@M ;Z);and it is well-known that\nevery non-trivial class in the latter group is represented by an essential surface in M. In\nparticular, if Mis closed and b1(M)>0;thenMcontains a (necessarily closed) essential\nsurface. Using the intersection pairing and a standard half-lives-half-dies argument, one\nobtains the analogous criterion that if @M6=;and 2b1(M)> b 1(@M);thenMcontains a\nclosed essential surface.\nSince the calculation of homology with integer coe\u000ecients reduces to computing Smith Normal\nForm of the (generally sparse) boundary matrices, our general approach is to \frst check if the\nexistence of closed essential surfaces follows from homology.\n2.4 Normal surface theory\nIn the case, where homology does not certify the existence of a closed essential surface (or is\nfrom the outset known not to do so, as is the case for a homology 3{sphere or the complement\nof a knot or link in a homology 3{sphere), we use Haken's approach to connect topology to\nlinear programming via normal surface theory in order to search for essential surfaces. A\nnormal surface in a (possibly ideal) triangulation Tis a properly embedded surface which\nintersects each tetrahedron of Tin a pairwise disjoint collection of triangles andquadrilaterals ,\nas shown in Figure 3. These triangles and quadrilaterals are called normal discs . In an ideal\ntriangulation of a non-compact 3{manifold, a normal surface may contain in\fnitely many\n6Figure 3: The seven types of normal disc in a tetrahedron.\ntriangles; such a surface is called spun-normal [26]. A normal surface may be disconnected or\nempty.\nWe now describe an algebraic approach to normal surfaces. The key observation is that each\nnormal surface contains \fnitely many quadrilateral discs, and is uniquely determined (up to\nnormal isotopy) by these quadrilateral discs. Here a normal isotopy ofMis an isotopy that\nkeeps all simplices of all dimensions \fxed. Let \u0003denote the set of all normal isotopy classes\nof normal quadrilateral discs in T, so thatj\u0003j= 3twheretis the number of tetrahedra in\nT. These normal isotopy classes are called quadrilateral types .\nWe identify R\u0003withR3t:Given a normal surface S;letx(S)2R\u0003=R3tdenote the integer\nvector for which each coordinate x(S)(q) counts the number of quadrilateral discs in Sof\ntypeq2\u0003. This normalQ{coordinate x(S) satis\fes the following two algebraic conditions.\nFirst,x(S) is admissible. A vector x2R\u0003isadmissible ifx\u00150, and for each tetrahedron\nxis non-zero on at most one of its three quadrilateral types. This re\rects the fact that an\nembedded surface cannot contain two di\u000berent types of quadrilateral in the same tetrahedron.\nSecond,x(S) satis\fes a linear equation for each interior edge in M;termed aQ{matching\nequation . Intuitively, these equations arise from the fact that as one circumnavigates the\nearth, one crosses the equator from north to south as often as one crosses it from south to\nnorth. We now give the precise form of these equations. To simplify the discussion, we assume\nthatMis oriented and all tetrahedra are given the induced orientation; see [26, Section 2.9]\nfor details.\ne\n(a) The abstract neighbour-\nhoodB(e)\n(b) Positive slope +1\n (c) Negative slope \u00001\nFigure 4: Slopes of quadrilaterals\nConsider the collection Cof all (ideal) tetrahedra meeting at an edge einM(including\nkcopies of tetrahedron \u001bifeoccursktimes as an edge in \u001b). We form the abstract\n7neighbourhood B(e) ofeby pairwise identifying faces of tetrahedra in Csuch that there is a\nwell de\fned quotient map from B(e) to the neighbourhood of einM; see Figure 4(a) for an\nillustration. Then B(e) is a ball (possibly with \fnitely many points missing on its boundary).\nWe think of the (ideal) endpoints of eas the poles of its boundary sphere, and the remaining\npoints as positioned on the equator.\nLet\u001bbe a tetrahedron in C. The boundary square of a normal quadrilateral of type qin\u001b\nmeets the equator of @B(e) if and only it has a vertex on e. In this case, it has a slope \u00061 of a\nwell{de\fned sign on @B(e) which is independent of the orientation of e. Refer to Figures 4(b)\nand 4(c), which show quadrilaterals with positive and negative slopes respectively.\nGiven a quadrilateral type qand an edge e;there is a total weight wte(q) ofqate;which\nrecords the sum of all slopes of qate(we sum because qmight meet emore than once,\nifeappears as multiple edges of the same tetrahedron). If qhas no corner on e;then\nwe set wt e(q) = 0:Given edge einM;theQ{matching equation of eis then de\fned by\n0 =P\nq2\u0003wte(q)x(q).\nTheorem 2 For eachx2R\u0003with the properties that xhas integral coordinates, xis ad-\nmissible and xsatis\fes the Q{matching equations, there is a (possibly non-compact) normal\nsurfaceSsuch thatx=x(S):Moreover,Sis unique up to normal isotopy and adding or\nremoving vertex linking surfaces, i.e., normal surfaces consisting entirely of normal triangles.\nThis is related to Hauptsatz 2 of [11]. For a proof of Theorem 2, see [21, Theorem 2.1] or [26,\nTheorem 2.4]. The set of all x2R\u0003with the property that (i) x\u00150 and (ii)xsatis\fes the\nQ{matching equations is denoted Q(T):This naturally is a polyhedral cone, but the set of\nall admissible x2R\u0003typically meets Q(T) in a non-convex set.\nTollefson [27] proved the following theorem building on the work of Jaco and Oertel [15].\nTheorem 3 (Tollefson) LetMbe a (simplicially) triangulated, compact, irreducible, @{\nirreducible 3-manifold. If there exists a two-sided, incompressible, @{incompressible surface\ninM, then there exists one that is a Q{vertex surface.\nWe remark that Tollefson (and the authors he cites) work with simplicial triangulations or\nhandlebody decompositions. A close examination of the proof in [27] reveals that it applies\nfor (singular) triangulations, and that it also shows that if Mcontains an essential surface,\nthen there exists one that is a Q{vertex surface. We will state and prove a variant of this\nbelow (Theorem 4).\n2.5 Reduced form\nLetMbe a (ideally or materially) triangulated 3{manifold. The weight of the normal surface\nFis the cardinality of its intersection with the 1{skeleton, wt( F) =jF\\M(1)j:IfFis closed,\nthen its weight is \fnite.\nTwo normal surfaces are compatible if they do not meet a tetrahedron in quadrilateral discs of\ndi\u000berent types. In this case, the sum of their normal coordinates is the coordinate of a normal\nsurface. Suppose F1andF2are closed normal surfaces that are compatible, not vertex linking\n8(a)\n (b)\n (c)\n (d)\nFigure 5: Regular exchange of normal discs\nsurfaces, and in general position. Then x(F1) +x(F2) is an admissible solution to the Q{\nmatching equations, and hence represented by a unique closed normal surface without vertex\nlinking components; denote this surface F:The surface Fis obtained geometrically as follows.\nAt each component of F1\\F2;there is a natural choice of regular switch between normal discs,\nsuch that the result is again a normal surface. See Figure 5 for some possible con\fgurations\ninvolving only two discs. Denote N(F1\\F2) a small, open, tubular neighbourhood of F1\\F2:\nThe connected components of ( F1[F2)nN(F1\\F2) are termed patches .\nDeleting any vertex linking tori that arise gives the surface F;and we write F+ \u0006 =F1+F2;\nwhere \u0006 is a (possibly empty) \fnite union of vertex linking tori. This is called the Haken\nsum ofF1andF2:Both weight and Euler characteristic are additive under this sum. So we\nhave\nwt(F1) + wt(F2) = wt(F) + wt(\u0006);\n\u001f(F1) +\u001f(F2) =\u001f(F);\nsince\u001f(\u0006) = 0:\nThe sumF+\u0006 =F1+F2is said to be in reduced form if there is no Haken sum F+\u00060=F0\n1+F0\n2;\nwhereF0\niis isotopic to FiinM; F0\n1\\F0\n2has fewer components than F1\\F2and \u00060is a\nunion of vertex linking tori. It should be noted that in these two sums, the embedding of F\ninMis the same (these are not equalities up to isotopy), and that any sum can be changed\nto a sum in reduced form.\n2.6 Crushing triangulations\nThe crushing process of Jaco and Rubinstein [16] plays an important role in our algorithms,\nand we informally outline this process here. We refer the reader to [16] for the formal details,\nor to [3] for a simpli\fed approach.\nLetSbe a two-sided normal surface in a triangulation Tof a compact orientable 3-manifold\nM(with or without boundary). To crushSinT, we (i) cutTopen along S, which splits each\ntetrahedron into a number of (typically non-tetrahedral) pieces, several of which are illustrated\n9in Figure 6(a); (ii) crush each resulting copy of Son the boundary to a point, which converts\nthese pieces into tetrahedra, footballs and/or pillows as shown in Figure 6(b); and (iii) \ratten\neach football or pillow to an edge or triangle respectively, as shown in Figure 6(c).\n(a) Pieces after cutting open along S\n(b) Pieces after crushing Sto a point\n(c) Flattening footballs and pillows\nFigure 6: Steps in the Jaco-Rubinstein crushing process\nThe result is a new collection of tetrahedra with a new set of face identi\fcations. We emphasise\nthat we only keep track of face identi\fcations between tetrahedra: any \\pinched\" edges or\nvertices fall apart, and any lower-dimensional pieces (triangles, edges or vertices) that do not\nbelong to any tetrahedra simply disappear. The resulting structure might not represent a\n3-manifold triangulation, and even if it does the \rattening operations might have changed the\nunderlying 3-manifold in ways that we did not intend.\nAlthough crushing can cause a myriad of problems in general, Jaco and Rubinstein show that\nin some cases the operation behaves extremely well [16]. In particular, if Sis a normal sphere\nor disc, then after crushing we always obtain a triangulation of some 3-manifold M0(possibly\ndisconnected, and possibly empty) that is obtained from the original Mby zero or more of\nthe following operations:\n\u000fcutting manifolds open along spheres and \flling the resulting boundary spheres with\n3-balls;\n\u000fcutting manifolds open along properly embedded discs;\n\u000fcapping boundary spheres of manifolds with 3-balls;\n\u000fdeleting entire connected components that are any of the 3-ball, the 3-sphere, projective\nspace RP3;the lens space L(3;1) or the product space S2\u0002S1:\nAn important observation is that the number of tetrahedra that remain after crushing is\nprecisely the number of tetrahedra that do not contain quadrilaterals of S.\n103 Closed normal surfaces in Q{space\nIn this section we review the linear boundary map of [26], with which we restrict the normal\nsurface solution space to closed surfaces only, and we provide the required extensions of Jaco\nand Oertel's result in the context of singular triangulations and ideal triangulations.\n3.1 Boundary map\nSupposeTis an ideal triangulation of the interior Mof a compact, orientable manifold\nwith non-empty boundary. The cases we are interested in are when Mis irreducible and\n@{irreducible; or when Mis the complement of the set of vertices in the triangulation of a\nclosed, irreducible 3{manifold. To keep the discussion succinct, we treat these cases together\nunder the above more general hypothesis.\nThe link of an ideal vertex vis an orientable surface Bvof genusgv\u00150, and we may assume\nthatBvis a normal surface entirely made up of normal triangles. Let \r2H1(Bv;R):We now\ndescribe an associated linear functional \u0017(\r):R\u0003!R;which measures the behaviour along\n\rof a normal surface near the ideal vertex v. The idea is similar to the intuitive description\nof theQ{matching equations. As one goes along \rand looks down into the manifold, normal\nquadrilaterals will (as Je\u000b Weeks puts it) come up from below ordrop down out of sight . If\nthe total number coming up minus the total number dropping down is non-zero, then the\nsurface spirals towards the ideal vertex in the cross section \r\u0002[0;1)\u001aBv\u0002[0;1) and the\nsign indicates the direction, see Figure 8(b) for a sketch when Bvis a torus. If this number\nis zero, then after a suitable isotopy the surface meets the cross section in a (possibly empty)\nunion of circles, see Figure 8(c).\nThe surface Bvhas an induced triangulation consisting of normal triangles. Represent \r\nby an oriented path on Bv;which is disjoint from the 0{skeleton and meets the 1{skeleton\ntransversely. Each edge of a triangle in Bvis a normal arc. Give the edges of each triangle in\nBvtransverse orientations pointing into the triangle and labelled by the quadrilateral types\nsharing the normal arc with the triangle; see Figure 7. We then de\fne \u0017(\r) as follows. Choos-\ning any starting point on \r;we read o\u000b a formal linear combination of quadrilateral types\nqby taking + qeach time the corresponding edge is crossed with the transverse orientation,\nand\u0000qeach time it is crossed against the transverse orientation (where each edge in Bvis\ncounted twice|using the two adjacent triangles).\ne\nee e\nqq\nq′q′\nq′′q′′\nFigure 7: Coming up and dropping down\nEvaluating \u0017(\r) at somex2R\u0003gives a real number \u0017x(\r):For example, taking a small\nloop around a vertex in Tand setting this equal to zero gives the Q{matching equation\n11of the corresponding edge in M; see Figure 8(a). For each x2Q(T);the resulting map\n\u0017v;x:H1(Bv;R)!Ris a well-de\fned homomorphism, which has the property that the\nsurface in Theorem 2 is closed if and only if \u0017v;x= 0 (see [26], Proposition 3.3). Since\n\u0017v;x:H1(Bv;R)!Ris a homomorphism, it is trivial if and only if we have \u0017v;x(\u000bi) = 0 =\n\u0017v;x(\fi) for any basisf\u000bi;\fig1\u0014i\u0014gvofH1(Bv;R):\nq1q2q3q4\nqkqk−1vγ\n(a) 0 =\u0017x(\r) =Pk\ni=1(\u00001)ix(qi) is the\nQ{matching equation\nSS\nS\nB K(b) spun()\u0017x6= 0\nSSS\nB K (c) not spun()\u0017x= 0\nFigure 8: Boundary map determines Q{matching equations and spinning\nWe de\fne \u0017x=\bv\u0017v;x;where the sum is taken over all ideal vertices. The surface in\nTheorem 2 is closed if and only if \u0017x= 0 (see [26], Proposition 3.3). We then de\fne Q0(T) =\nQ(T)\\fxj\u0017x= 0g;and call a 2{sided, connected normal, surface FwithQ(F) on an\nextremal ray of Q0(T) aQ0{vertex surface.\nWe remark that if Bvis a sphere, then \u0017v;x= 0 and hence in the case where each Bvis a\nsphere, we have Q0(T) =Q(T):\n3.2 Jaco-Oertel revisited\nFor the algorithms of this paper, we require the following results, which are based on the\nseminal work of Jaco and Oertel [15].\nTheorem 4 LetMbe a triangulated, closed, orientable, irreducible 3-manifold. If there\nexists an essential surface SinM, then there is a normal essential surface Fwith the property\nthatx(F)lies on an extremal ray of Q0(T) =Q(T):\nMoreover, if \u001f(S)<0(resp.\u001f(S) = 0 ), then there is such Fwith\u001f(F)<0(resp.\u001f(F) = 0 ).\nTheorem 5 SupposeMis the interior of an irreducible and @{irreducible, compact, ori-\nentable 3{manifold with non-empty boundary, and let Tbe an ideal triangulation of M:If\nMcontains a closed, essential surface S;then there is a normal, closed essential surface F\nwith the property that x(F)lies on an extremal ray of Q0(T):\nMoreover, if \u001f(S)<0, then there is such Fwith\u001f(F)<0. If, in addition, the link of each\nvertex has zero Euler characteristic, then if \u001f(S) = 0 , then there is such Fwith\u001f(F) = 0:\nProof of Theorems 4 and 5 SupposeMcontains a closed, essential surface. It follows\nfrom a standard argument (see, for instance, [15] and [16]) that there is a closed, essential,\n12normal surface SinM:It remains to show that Smay be chosen such that Sis aQ0{vertex\nsurface. Replace Sby a normal surface that has least weight amongst all normal surfaces\nisotopic (but not necessarily normally isotopic) to S:Denote this least weight surface Sagain.\nSupposeSis not aQ0{vertex surface. Then\nnx(S) =X\nnix(Vi);\nwheren;ni2Nand either Vior 2Viis aQ0{vertex surface for each i:The two cases\narise from the fact that we require a Q0{vertex surface to be 2{sided and connected: If V\ncorresponds to the \frst integer lattice point on an admissible extremal ray of Q0(T) andV\nis 1{sided, then the corresponding Q0{vertex surface is 2 V;obtained by taking the boundary\nof a regular neighbourhood of V:\nWe denote nSthe normal surface obtained by taking nparallel copies of S:Clearly,x(nS) =\nnx(S);and sinceShas least weight in its isotopy class, so does nSbecauseSis 2{sided. To\nsum up,nSis a closed, essential, normal surface which has least weight amongst all normal\nsurfaces in its isotopy class.\nFor anyi;eitherVior 2Viis aQ0{vertex surface. In the \frst case, we can write\nnS+ \u0006 =V+W;\nwhere \u0006 is a \fnite sum of pairwise disjoint vertex linking surfaces disjoint from nS,V=Vi\nandx(W) =\u0000x(Vi) +Pnix(Vi):NownSis 2{sided and of least weight, so the ingenious\nproof of [15, Theorem 2.2] can be adapted (analogous to [21, Theorem 5.4]) to show that if\none writes nS+ \u0006 =V0+W0in reduced form, then both V0andW0are two-sided and\nincompressible. Now V0is isotopic in MtoV;and henceVis also incompressible. If 2 Viis a\nQ0{vertex surface, then we apply the above argument to 2 nS;writing 2nS+\u0006 =V+W;where\nx(V) = 2x(Vi) andx(W) =\u0000x(V)+2Pnix(Vi):In either case, we obtain an incompressible\nQ0{vertex surface V:We will now show that Vis essential, i.e. that Vis neither a 2{sphere\nnor isotopic to a vertex linking surface. In doing so, we will always refer to the reduced form\nmS+ \u0006 =V0+W0;wherem=norm= 2n:\nSuppose \frst that Vis a 2{sphere. Then the 2{sphere V0bounds a ball BinM. Now\nifV0\\W0is non-empty, then using an innermost circles argument and the fact that W0is\nincompressible, we obtain a contradiction to the fact that mS+ \u0006 =V0+W0is reduced.\nWhenceV0\\W0=;:But sincemS+ \u0006 =V0+W0;this implies that either Sis a 2{sphere\nor a component of \u0006 contains a quadrilateral disc, which is a contradiction. Whence Vis not\na 2{sphere, and it follows that none of the vertex surfaces Viis a 2{sphere.\nThis, together with the fact that Euler characteristic is additive over Haken sums completes\nthe proof of Theorem 4.\nHence assume that Mis non-compact and that V(and therefore V0) is isotopic to the link\nof some vertex of genus \u00151:LetBvbe such a vertex link which is isotopic to V0and\ndisjoint from the closed surface W0:Then there is a product region N\u0018=Bv\u0002IinMwith\n@N=Bv[V0:The only incompressible and @{incompressible surfaces in N\u0018=Bv\u0002Iare\nisotopic to horizontal surfaces homeomorphic with Bvorvertical annuli (and hence meet\nbothBvandV0).\nSuppose that there is a connected component UofW0\\Nwith non-empty boundary. Then\n@U\u001aV0;andUis incompressible but @{compressible in N:We can therefore perform a\n13sequence of boundary compressions, which can be promoted to an isotopy of Uto a subsurface\nofV0:Whence choosing an innermost such component UofW0\\N, we see that performing\nregular exchanges at all intersection curves in U\\V0gives a contradiction to the fact that\nnS+ \u0006 =V0+W0is reduced.\nHenceW0\\V0=;:But then a component of nS+ \u0006 is isotopic but not normally isotopic\nto a vertex linking surface, giving the \fnal contradiction.\n3.3 Example\nThe trivial circle bundle over a once-punctured surface of genus two has a triangulation TM\nwith isomorphism signature\nsLLLLPLPMvQAQbefijjlklkjpqqoorrraxaaaaaaaaxhaaaahhh .\nThis triangulation was created for us by Mark Bell using flipper [1].\nThere are 29 admissible vertex solutions spanning Q(TM);and this set is identical with the set\nof fundamental solutions. Exactly 9 of the corresponding fundamental surfaces are thin-edge\nlinking surfaces of genus two. Hence after one compression they reduce to a boundary parallel\ntorus. The remaining 20 vertex surfaces are spun-normal.\nIn contrast, the space Q0(TM) has 81 admissible vertex solutions, and these again coincide\nwith the admissible fundamental solutions. The corresponding surfaces are 9 thin edge linking\nsurfaces of genus two, 4 separating essential tori and the remaining 68 are non-separating\nessential tori.\n4 Algorithms\nWe present general algorithms to decide whether any 3{manifold satisfying the hypotheses of\nTheorems 4 or 5 contains a closed essential surface.\n4.1 Non-compact manifolds\nWe present the algorithm in two stages below. Algorithm 6 describes a subroutine to test\nwhether a given separating closed surface is incompressible. Algorithm 8 is the main algorithm:\nit uses the results of Section 3 to identify candidate essential surfaces, and runs Algorithm 6\nover each.\nThese algorithms contain a number of high-level and often intricate procedures, many of which\nare described in separate papers. For each algorithm, we discuss these procedures in further\ndetail after presenting the overall algorithm structure.\nAlgorithm 6 (Testing for incompressibility of separating surface) SupposeTis known to\nbe an ideal triangulation of the interior Mof an irreducible and @{irreducible, compact,\norientable 3{manifold with non-empty boundary. Let Sbe a separating, closed, two-sided\nnormal surface of genus g\u00151withinT. To test whether Sis incompressible in M:\n14(1)Truncate each ideal vertex of T(i.e. remove a small open neighbourhood of that vertex)\nto obtain a compact manifold with boundary, cut Topen along the surface S, and\nretriangulate. The result is a pair of triangulations T1;T2representing two compact\nmanifolds with boundary M1;M 2(one on each side of SinM).\nLetS1;S2be the genus gboundary components of T1andT2respectively that cor-\nrespond to the surface S, and letBk;1\u0014k\u0014 j@Mjbe the remaining boundary\ncomponents of the triangulations.\n(2)For eachi= 1;2:\n(a) SimplifyTiinto a triangulation with no internal vertices and only one vertex on\neach boundary component, without increasing the number of tetrahedra. Let the\nresulting number of tetrahedra in Tiben.\n(b) Search for a connected normal surface EinTithat is not a vertex link, has positive\nEuler characteristic, and does not meet any of the boundary components Bk.\n(c) If no such Eexists, then there is no compressing disc for SinMi. Ifi= 1then try\ni= 2instead, and if i= 2then terminate with the result that Sis incompressible.\n(d) Otherwise crush the surface Eas explained in Section 2.6 to obtain a new trian-\ngulationT0\ni(possibly disconnected, or possibly empty) with strictly fewer than n\ntetrahedra. If some component of T0\nihas the same genus boundary (or boundaries)\nasTithen it represents the same manifold Mi, and we return to step 2a using this\ncomponent ofT0\niinstead. Otherwise we terminate with the result that Sis not\nincompressible.\nRegarding the individual steps of this algorithm:\n\u000fStep 1 requires us to truncate an ideal vertex and cut a triangulation open along a normal\nsurface. These are standard (though intricate) procedures. To truncate a vertex we\nsubdivide tetrahedra and then remove the immediate neighbourhood of the vertex. To\ncut along a normal surface is more complex; a manageable implementation is described\nin [8].\n\u000fStep 2a requires us to simplify a triangulation to use the fewest possible vertices, without\nincreasing the number of tetrahedra. For this we begin with the rich polynomial-time\nsimpli\fcation heuristics described in [2]. In practice, for all 2979 knots that we consider\nin Section 6, this is su\u000ecient to reduce the triangulation to the desired number of\nvertices.\nIf there are still extraneous vertices, we can remove these using the crushing techniques\nof Jaco and Rubinstein [16, Section 5.2]. This might fail, but only if @Mihas a com-\npressing disc, or two boundary components of Miare separated by a sphere; since M\nis@{irreducible and irreducible both cases immediately certify that the surface Sis\ncompressible, and we can terminate immediately.\n\u000fStep 2b requires us to locate a connected normal surface EinTithat is not a vertex\nlink, has positive Euler characteristic, and does not any of the boundary components\nBk. For this we use the recent method of [6, Algorithm 11], which draws on com-\nbinatorial optimisation techniques: in essence we run a sequence of linear programs\nover a combinatorial search tree, and prune this tree using tailored branch-and-bound\nmethods. See [6] for details.\n15We note that this search is the bottleneck of Algorithm 6: the search is worst-case\nexponential time, though in practice it often runs much faster [6]. The exposition in\n[6] works in the setting where the underlying triangulation is a knot complement, but\nthe methods work equally well in our setting here. To avoid the boundary components\nBk, we simply remove all normal discs that touch any of the Bkfrom our coordinate\nsystem.\nTheorem 7 Algorithm 6 terminates, and its output is correct.\nProof The algorithm terminates because each time we loop back to step 2a we have fewer\ntetrahedra than before. To prove correctness, we now devote ourselves to proving the many\nclaims that are made throughout the statement of Algorithm 6.\nBefore proceeding, however, we make a brief note regarding irreducibility. Since Mis irre-\nducible, every embedded 2{sphere in Mmust bound a ball. As a result, the two manifolds\nM1andM2are likewise irreducible, with the following possible exception. Suppose Mjis\nreducible, so there is a sphere FinMjwhich does not bound a ball. Since Mis irreducible,\nthis sphere bounds a ball in Mand hence all boundary components BkofMare on one\nside of this sphere. Therefore, they are all boundary components of Mj, and the sphere F\nseparates the union of all BkfromSj:WhenceSis contained in a ball in Mand therefore\ncompressible. (Note that a compression disc for Smay be in the reducible manifold Mjor\nin the other component, which is necessarily irreducible.)\nWe proceed now with proofs of the various claims made in Algorithm 6.\n\u000fIn step 1 we claim that cutting along Syields two compact manifolds .\nThis is because Sis a assumed to be separating.\n\u000fIn step 2c we claim that, if the surface Ecannot be found in T1and it cannot be found\ninT2, then the original surface Smust be incompressible.\nSuppose that Swere compressible, with a compression disc in some Mi. If thisMi\nis irreducible, then by a result of Jaco and Oertel [15, Lemma 4.1] there is a normal\ncompressing disc in Ti. Since the underlying manifold is @{irreducible, this compressing\ndisc must meet the genus gboundarySi(not any of the Bk), and so it is a surface\nof the type we are searching for. If this Miis reducible then (from earlier) we have\nthat there is a properly embedded sphere within Mi, which separates the boundary\ncomponents BkofMifromSi;so it is a surface of the type we are searching for.\n\u000fIn step 2d we claim that the new triangulation T0\nihas strictly fewer tetrahedra than Ti.\nThis is because Eis connected but not a vertex link, and therefore contains at least one\nnormal quadrilateral. As noted in Section 2.6, this means that at least one tetrahedron\nofTiis deleted in the Jaco-Rubinstein crushing process.\n\u000fIn step 2d we claim that if T0\nihas a component with the same genus boundary (or\nboundaries) asTithen this component represents the same manifold Mi, and if not\nthenSis compressible.\nSince the surface Ethat we crush is connected with positive Euler characteristic and can\nbe embedded within an irreducible, orientable 3{manifold with non-empty boundary, it\nfollows that Eis either a sphere or a disc. From x2.6, this means that when we crush\nEin the triangulation Ti, the resulting manifold is obtained from Miby a sequence of\nzero or more of the following operations:\n16{undoing connected sums;\n{cutting open along properly embedded discs;\n{\flling boundary spheres with 3{balls;\n{deleting an entire component which is homeomorphic with a 3{ball, 3{sphere, RP3,\nL3;1orS2\u0002S1.\nSinceMis irreducible and @{irreducible, cutting Miopen along a properly embedded\ndisc either cuts o\u000b a 3{ball or corresponds to a compression of Si:We now analyse the\ne\u000bect of crushing on Mi:\nSuppose that Miis irreducible. Then undoing a connected sum simply has the e\u000bect\nof creating an extra 3{sphere component (which will be deleted) and \flling a bound-\nary sphere with a ball. If we ever cut along a properly embedded disc that is nota\ncompressing disc, then likewise this just creates an extra 3-ball component. If we cut\nalong a compressing disc, then this yields one or two pieces with strictly smaller total\nboundary genus than before; moreover, since the underlying manifold is @{irreducible,\nthe \frst such compression must take place along the genus gboundarySi(not anyBk)\nand soSmust be compressible. Together these observations establish the full claim\nabove: we either terminate with the correctly identi\fed result that Sis compressible\nor return a smaller triangulation of Mito step 2a.\nSupposeMiis reducible. Then, as above, undoing a connected sum either creates extra\n3{sphere components, or we have undone a non-trivial connected sum. In the latter case,\none sphere in the associated collection must separate boundary components of Mi, so\nthat no component of T0\nihas the same boundary as Ti;and since this sphere certi\fes\nthatSis compressible the conclusion is correct. Similarly, cutting along a properly\nembedded disc that is nota compressing disc, creates an extra 3-ball component, whilst\ncutting along a compression discs changes the boundary of Mi:Whence in this case,\nwe also either terminate with the correctly identi\fed result that Sis compressible or\nreturn a smaller triangulation of Mito step 2a.\nWe can now package together a full algorithm to test for closed essential surfaces:\nAlgorithm 8 (Closed essential surface in ideal triangulation) SupposeTis known to be an\nideal triangulation of the interior Mof an irreducible and @{irreducible, compact, orientable\n3{manifold Mwith non-empty boundary.\nTo test whether Mcontains a closed essential surface:\n(1)Test whether 2b1(M)>b 1(@M):If yes, then terminate with the result that Mcontains\na closed essential surface.\n(2)Otherwise enumerate all extremal rays of Q0(T); denote these e1;:::;ek. For each\nextremal ray ei, letSibe the unique connected two-sided normal surface for which\nx(Si)lies on ei. From the previous step, we know that each Siis separating.\n(3)For each non-spherical surface Si, use Algorithm 6 to test whether Siis incompressible\ninT. If the genus of Siis di\u000berent from the genera of the vertex links of M, then\nterminate with the result that Mcontains a closed essential surface.\n17(4)Now eachSiis a sphere or has genus equal to a vertex link. So for each non-spherical\nsurfaceSi, test whether Siis boundary parallel by (i) cutting Topen along Siand\ntruncating all ideal vertices, and then (ii) using the Jaco-Tollefson algorithm [17, Al-\ngorithm 9.7] to test whether one of the resulting components is homeomorphic to the\nproduct space Si\u0002[0;1]. IfSiis not boundary parallel, then terminate with the result\nthatMcontains a closed essential surface. Otherwise all incompressible surfaces are\nfound to be boundary parallel, then terminate with the result that Mcontains no closed\nessential surface.\nRegarding the individual steps:\n\u000fStep 1 requires us to compute homology. This is a standard routine using Smith normal\nform, and implemented following Hafner and McCurley [10].\n\u000fStep 2 requires us to enumerate all extremal rays of Q0(T). This is an expensive\nprocedure (which is unavoidable, since there is a worst-case exponential number of\nextremal rays). For this we use the recent state-of-the-art tree traversal method [7],\nwhich is tailored to the constraints and pathologies of normal surface theory and is\nfound to be highly e\u000bective for larger problems. The tree traversal method works in\nthe larger cone Q(T), but it is a simple matter to insert the additional linear equations\ncorresponding to \u0017x= 0.\nWe also note that it is simple to identify the unique closed two-sided normal surface for\nwhichx(S) lies on the extremal ray e. Speci\fcally, x(S) is either the smallest integer\nvector on eor, if that vector yields a one-sided surface, then its double.\n\u000fStep 4 requires us to run the Jaco-Tollefson algorithm to test whether any incompressible\nsurface is boundary-parallel. This algorithm is expensive: it requires us to work in a\nlarger normal coordinate system, solve di\u000ecult enumeration problems, and perform\nintricate geometric operations. However, in our applications, we work (mostly) with\nhyperbolic 3{manifolds of \fnite volume, for which we never enter this step. Also, in\nthe case where the boundary of the manifold consists of tori, there are additional fast\nmethods for avoiding the Jaco-Tollefson algorithm. For instance, one may run Haraway's\nT2\u0002Itest [13, Proposition 13] in conjunction with the algorithms from [6].\nTheorem 9 Algorithm 8 terminates, and its output is correct.\nProof The algorithm terminates because it does not contain any loops. All that remains is\nto prove that its output is correct.\nThroughout this proof we implicitly use Theorem 7 to verify that all calls to Algorithm 6 are\nthemselves correct. We note that the conditions of Theorem 5 apply.\nFrom Theorem 5, the manifold Mcontains a closed essential surface if and only if one of the\nclosed normal surfaces Siin our list (excluding spheres) is essential. We ignore spheres from\nnow onwards. We note that each surface in the list that has genus di\u000berent from all vertex\nlinks is essential if and only if it is incompressible (since such a surface cannot be boundary\nparallel), and each remaining surface in the list is essential if and only if it is (i) incompressible\nand (ii) not boundary parallel.\nSteps 3 and 4 of Algorithm 8 test precisely these conditions, and so the algorithm is correct.\nThe only reason for the order in these steps is so that we can use Algorithm 6 exclusively if\npossible, and only fall through to the more expensive Jaco-Tollefson algorithm when absolutely\nnecessary.\n184.2 Closed manifolds\nFor reference, we also spell out the algorithm for closed, irreducible, orientable 3{manifolds,\nwhich follows the same outline as the algorithm for non-compact 3{manifolds, but with fewer\nsteps. Indeed, cutting along a separating normal surface in a closed 3{manifold results in two\ncompact 3{manifolds which have a copy of this surface as a boundary component. Components\nof this kind are also dealt with by Algorithm 6.\nAlgorithm 10 (Closed essential surface in triangulation) SupposeTis known to be a\n(possibly singular) triangulation of the closed, irreducible, orientable 3-manifold M:To test\nwhetherMcontains a closed essential surface:\n(1)Test whether b1(M)>0:If yes, then terminate with the result that Mcontains a\n"}

We prove a gluing formula for the families Seiberg-Witten in vari-\nants of families of 4-manifolds obtained by ﬁbrewise connec ted sum. Our\nformula expresses the families Seiberg-Witten invariants of such a connected\nsum family in terms of the ordinary Seiberg-Witten invarian ts of one of the\nsummands, under certain assumptions on the families. We con struct some\nvariants of the families Seiberg-Witten invariants and pro ve the gluing for-\nmula also for these variants. One variant incorporates a twi st of the families\nmoduli space using the charge conjugation symmetry of the Se iberg-Witten\nequations. The other variant is an equivariant Seiberg-Wit ten invariant of\nsmooth group actions. We consider several applications of t he gluing formula\nincluding: obstructions to smooth isotopy of diﬀeomorpihs ms, computation of\nthe mod 2 Seiberg-Witten invariants of spin structures, rel ations between mod\n2 Seiberg-Witten invariants of 4-manifolds and obstructio ns to the existence\nof invariant metrics of positive scalar curvature for smoot h group actions on\n4-manifolds.\n1.Introduction\nThe Seiberg-Witten invariants of smooth 4-manifolds admit an exten sion to the\nparametrised setting. This means that instead of a single 4-manifold , we consider\nthemoduli spaceofsolutionstotheSeiberg-Witten equationsfora familyofsmooth\n4-manifolds. Hereafamilyofsmooth4-manfoldsmeansalocallytrivial ﬁbrebundle\nover a base space whose ﬁbres are a ﬁxed compact smooth 4-manif oldXequipped\nwith a Spincstructure, and the transition functions for the bundle are valued in the\ngroup of diﬀeomorphisms of Xpreserving the orientation and Spinc-structure. The\nidea of studying the Seiberg-Witten equations for such a family was p roposed by\nDonaldson in [5] and later pursued by various authors including Ruber man [17, 19],\nLiu [11], Li-Liu [12] and Nakamura [14].\nOne expects the families Seiberg-Witten invariants to have many dee p applica-\ntions to the study of families of smooth 4-manifolds, just as the ord inary Seiberg-\nWitten invariants have produced many profound results in the stud y of individual\nsmooth 4-manifolds. For example, Ruberman used a certain 1-para meter families\nSeiberg-Witten invariant to show that the space of positive scalar m etric on certain\nsimply-connected 4-manifolds has inﬁnitely many connected compon ents [19]. In\norder to realise such applications one needs practical tools for com puting the fami-\nlies invariants, just as one has for the ordinary Seiberg-Witten inva riants. To date\nonly a limited set of tools are available such as the families wall-crossing f ormula\n[12] and families blowup formula [11]. Both of these express one set of families in-\nvariantsintermsofanotherset, soitis diﬃcult togetoﬀtheground withjust these.\nDate: January 1, 2019.\n12 DAVID BARAGLIA, HOKUTO KONNO\nIn [19] Ruberman devised a technique for computing the families Seibe rg-Witten\ninvariant for a special class of 1-dimensional families, where Xis a connected sum\nofthe form X=M#CP2#2CP2and the family is the mapping cylinder of a certain\ndiﬀeomorphism of CP2#2CP2.\nIn this paper, we will prove a far-reaching generalisation of Ruberm an’s 1-\nparameter formula. Our formula will relate the parametrised Seiber g-Witten in-\nvariant for a connected sum of families with ﬁbres X=M#Nto the ordinary\nSeiberg-Witten invariants on M. In this way, tools for computing the Seiberg-\nWitten invariants of Mbecome tools for computing the families Seiberg-Witten\ninvariants of X. Quite surprisingly, our formula for families Seiberg-Witten in-\nvariants has non-trivial consequences for the ordinary Seiberg- Witten invariants as\nwell.\nLet us brieﬂy outline the deﬁnition of the families Seiberg-Witten invar iants.\nTheir construction is described in more detail in Section 2. Our appro ach follows\n[12]but ismoregeneral, in particular[12] assumesthe existenceofa Spinc-structure\non the vertical tangent bundle while our deﬁnition does not always as sume this.\nIn addition to this, we deﬁne some further variants of the families Se iberg-Witten\ninvariants. One is a variant which incorporates twisting the families mo duli space\nby the so-called charge conjugation symmetry, as dscribed in Sect ion 2. The other\nis a variant of the families Seiberg-Witten invariant for actions of a gr oupGon a 4-\nmanifold by diﬀeomorphisms. This invariant takes values in the group c ohomology\nofGand is described in Section 3.\nLetXbe a compact smooth oriented 4-manifold and let Bbe a compact smooth\nmanifold. Suppose we have a smooth ﬁbrewise oriented ﬁbre bundle πX:EX→B\nwhose ﬁbres are diﬀeomorphic to X. LetsXbe a Spinc-structure on X. We will\nassumethat sXcanbeextendedtoacontinuouslyvaryingfamilyofSpinc-structures\non the ﬁbres of EX. Equivalently, the transition functions for EXcan be chosen to\nbe diﬀeomorphisms of Xpreserving the isomorphism classes of sX. In general this\nis a weaker condition than requiring that the vertical tangent bund le ofEXadmits\na Spinc-structures extending sX.\nFor simplicity, we concern ourselves in this introduction with just the Z2-valued\nfamilies Seiberg-Witten invariants (see Sections 2-4 for details of th eZ-valued in-\nvariants). Let\nd(X,sX) =c1(sX)2−σ(X)\n4−1−b+(X)+b1(X)\nbe the virtual dimension of the unparametrised Seiberg-Witten mod uli space of X.\nAssume that\nb+(X)>dim(B)+1.\nThis assumption is necessary to have a well-deﬁned families Seiberg-W itten in-\nvariant. Under this assumption, for any family of ﬁbrewise metrics gXonEX,\nthere exists a families perturbation ηXonEXfor which the families moduli space\nM=M(EX,gX,ηX,sX) is either empty or a smooth manifold of dimension\ndim(M) =d(X,sX)+dim(B).\nIfsXextends to a Spinc-structure on the vertical tangent bundle of EX, the def-\ninition of the families moduli space Mis the standard one, as discussed in [12].A GLUING FORMULA FOR FAMILIES SEIBERG-WITTEN INVARIANTS 3\nHowever, one can still deﬁne the families moduli space Munder the weaker condi-\ntion that we can equip EXwith a continuously varying family of Spinc-structures,\nin the sense described above.\nThe simplest version of the families Seiberg-Witten invariant is deﬁned to be the\nhomomorphism\nFSWZ2(EX,sX,) :Hdim(M)(B,Z2)→Z2,\ngiven by\nFSWZ2(EX,sX,θ) =/a\\}b∇acketle{tπ∗θ,[M]/a\\}b∇acket∇i}ht,\nwhere denotes [ M] is the fundamental class of MwithZ2-coeﬃcients.\nA more general families Seiberg-Witten invariant is obtained by incorp orating\na certain line bundle L → M on the families moduli space. Recall that for the\nunparametrised Seiberg-Witten moduli space, one obtains Las the line bundle\nassociated to the principal circle bundle /tildewiderM → M , where/tildewiderMis the Seiberg-Witten\nmoduli space modulo the reduced gauge group of gauge transform ations which are\nthe identity at some ﬁxed basepoint of X. The circle bundle /tildewiderM → M corresponds\nto the residual action ofconstantgaugetransformations. In th e families setting, the\ndeﬁnition of the line bundle Lis similar but requires additional care. We construct\nLin Section 2 under the assumptions that b1(X) = 0 and that sXextends to a\nSpinc-structure on the vertical tangent bundle, which we denote by ˜sX. Then for\nanym≥0 we deﬁne a families Seiberg-Witten invariant\nFSWZ2\nm(EX,sX) :Hdim(M)−2m(B,Z2)→Z2\nFSWZ2\nm(EX,˜sX,θ) =/a\\}b∇acketle{tc1(L)m∪π∗θ,[M]/a\\}b∇acket∇i}ht ∈Z2.\nWe sometimes abuse notation and write FSWZ2m(EX,sX,θ) in place of\nFSWZ2m(EX,˜sX,θ), noting however that FSWZ2m(EX,˜sX,θ) in general depends on\nthe choice of extension ˜sX.\nWe now describe the setup for the gluing formula. More details can be found\nin Section 4. Our gluing result is for families obtained by a families connec ted\nsum. LetM,Nbe compact, smooth, oriented 4-manifolds and set X=M#N. In\nthis construction MandNwill play speciﬁc roles and the assumptions on Mand\nNwill not be symmetric. In particular we assume that b1(N) = 0 but make no\nassumption about b1(M) in general.\nLetBbe a compact smooth manifold and suppose we have smooth ﬁbrewise\noriented families πM:EM→B,πN:EN→Bwhose ﬁbres are M,Nrespec-\ntively. Suppose we are given sections ιM:B→EMandιN:B→ENwhose\nnormal bundles are orientation reversing isomorphic. Then by remo ving tubular\nneighbourhoods of the sections ιM,ιNfromEM,ENand identifying their bound-\naries using the orientation reversing isomorphism, we obtain a family EXoverB\nwhose ﬁbres are diﬀeomorphic to the connected sum X=M#N. In general EX\nwill depend on the isotopy classes of the sections ιM,ιNand the isomorphism of\ntheir normal bundles.\nLetsM,sNbe Spinc-structures on M,Nand letsXbe the Spinc-structure on\nXobtained as the connected sum of sMandsN. We will assume that sM,sN\ncan be extended to continuously varying families of Spinc-structures on the ﬁbres\nofEM,EN. It follows that sXsimilarly extends to a continuous family of Spinc-\nstructures on the ﬁbres of EX. We will assume that d(M,sM) = 2m≥0 is non-\nnegative and even.4 DAVID BARAGLIA, HOKUTO KONNO\nWe make the following assumptions about N. Assume that:\nc1(sN)2=σ(N)\nso that the index of the Spinc-Dirac operator on Nis zero. Assume also that:\n0<b+(N)≤dim(B).\nLetM=M(EX,gX,ηX,sX) be the Seiberg-Witten moduli space for the family\nEXwith respect to a choice of ﬁbrewise metric gXand ﬁbrewise perturbation ηX.\nIfb+(M) +b+(N)> dim(B) + 1, then Mis a compact smooth manifold for a\ngeneric choice of families perturbation. Assume this is the case and t hatηXhas\nbeen chosen generically. Then Mis either empty or a compact smooth manifold of\ndimension\ndim(M) =d(M,sM)+d(N,sN)+1+dim(B)\n= 2m+dim(B)−b+(N).\nThe main gluing theorem of this paper is as follows:\nTheorem 1.1 (Z2-valued gluing formula) .Suppose that either\n(i)d(M,sM) = 2m= 0, or\n(ii)b1(M) =b1(X) = 0andsXextends to a Spinc-structure on T(EX/B).\nThen:\n(1)For anyθ∈Hdim(B)−b+(N)(B,Z2), we have\nFSWZ2\nm(EX,sX,θ) =SW(M,sM)·/a\\}b∇acketle{tθ∪wb+(N)(H+(N)),[B]/a\\}b∇acket∇i}ht.\n(2)For any integer k>0and anyθ∈Hdim(B)−b+(N)+2k(B,Z2), we have\nFSWZ2\nm−k(EX,sX,θ) = 0.\nWe also prove such a gluing formula for the families Seiberg-Witten inva riants\nincorporating twists by charge conjugation (Theorem 4.3), for th eZ-valued invari-\nants(Theorem4.4)andfortheSeiberg-Witteninvariantsofgroup actions(Theorem\n9.20).\nIn Section 9 we consider various applications of the families gluing form ula.\nBelow we summarise some of the main results obtained.\nTheorem1.2. LetM,M′be compact simply-connected smooth 4-manifolds with in-\ndeﬁnite intersection forms. Suppose that M,M′are homeomorphic and ﬁx a home-\nomorphism φ:M→M′. Suppose that b+(M)>1and that sMis a Spinc-structure\nonMwithd(M,sM) = 0and thatSW(M,sM)/\\e}atio\\slash=SW(M′,φ(sM)) (mod 2) . Lastly,\nsuppose that X=M#(S2×S2)is diﬀeomorphic to M′#(S2×S2). Then there\nexists a diﬀeomorphism on Xwhich is continuously isotopic to the identity but not\nsmoothly isotopic.\nCorollary 1.3. The following 4-manifolds admit diﬀeomorphisms which are con-\ntinuously isotopic to the identity, but are not smoothly iso topic to the identity:\n(i)X= #n(S2×S2)#n(K3), for anyn≥2.\n(ii)X= #2nCP2#mCP2, for anyn≥2and anym≥10n+1.\nIn§9.4 we use the gluing formula to give a simple new proof of a theorem of\nMorgan and Szab´ o:A GLUING FORMULA FOR FAMILIES SEIBERG-WITTEN INVARIANTS 5\nTheorem 1.4 ([13]).LetMbe smooth compact spin 4-manifold with b1(M) = 0,\nb+(M) = 4n−1,b−(M) = 20n−1, wheren≥1. LetsMbe a Spinc-structure on\nMwhich comes from a spin structure. Then SW(M,sM)is odd ifn= 1and is\neven otherwise.\nIn§9.5 we show how the gluing formula can be used to compute the (un-\nparametrised) mod 2 Seiberg-Witten invariants of 4-manifolds unde r certain con-\nditions. Amongst such results we obtain the following:\nTheorem 1.5. LetMbe a compact smooth 4-manifold with b1(M) = 0and\nb+(M) = 3 (mod 4) . Suppose that f:M→Mis an involutive diﬀeomorphism\nofMwhose ﬁxed point set contains an isolated point. Suppose sup posesMis a\nSpinc-structure such that f(sM) =−sMandc1(sM)2−σ(M) = 0 (mod 16) .\n(i)Ifb+(M) = 3andc1(sM)2−σ(M)≥16, thenSW(M,sM) = 1 (mod 2) if\nfacts trivially on H+(M)andSW(M,sM) = 0 (mod 2) otherwise.\n(ii)Ifb+(M)>3, thenSW(M,sM) = 0 (mod 2) .\nIn§9.6, we prove the gluing formula for the Seiberg-Witten invariants of group\nactions as a consequence of the gluing formula for families. The non- vanishing\nof this invariant gives an obstruction to the existence of an invarian t metric with\npositive scalar curvature. In §9.7 we apply this formula to the simplest case where\nthe group is Z2. As a corollary, we ﬁnd:\nCorollary 1.6. For everyn≥4andm≥n+18, the4-manifoldX= #nCP2#mCP2\nadmits a metric of positive scalar curvature and a smooth inv olutionf:X→X\nsuch that there does not exist an f-invariant metric of positive scalar curvature on\nX.\nThe following is a brief outline of the sections of the paper. In Section 2 we give\nthe deﬁnition of the families Seiberg-Witten invariants including sever al generali-\nsations. In Section 3 we deﬁne an equivariant Seiberg-Witten invaria nt for smooth\ngroup actions and relate it to the families invariants. In Section 4 we d escribe in\ndetail the setup required to formulate the families gluing formula and state the\nmain result. Sections 5-8 give the proof of the gluing formula in sever al steps. Sec-\ntion 6 contains a review of the relevant aspects of gluing theory for unparametrised\nSeiberg-Witten theory, mostly followingthe textbook [15]. In partic ular§6.2 is con-\ncerned with the local Kuranishi model for glued conﬁgurations in Se iberg-Witten\ntheory. Section 7 is concerned with adapting the arguments of the previous sec-\ntions to the families setting. This turns out to be not as straightfor ward as one\nmight expect, in part because of the fact that certain obstructio n spaces in the local\nKuranishi model are non-zero. Additionally one has to choose the f amilies pertur-\nbation verycarefullyin orderfor the gluingargumentsto workwell. I n Section 9 we\nconsider various applications of the gluing formula: a vanishing theor em (§9.2), ob-\nstructions to smooth isotopy ( §9.3), the computation of the mod 2 Seiberg-Witten\ninvariants of spin structures ( §9.4), relations between mod 2 Seiberg-Witten invari-\nants of diﬀerent 4-manifolds, the gluing formula for the Seiberg-Wit ten invariants\nof group actions ( §9.6) and actions on 4-manifolds by involutions ( §9.7).\nAcknowledgments .

Although this type of invariant has been deﬁn ed by Li-\nLiu [12], we exhibit here some of its generalisations. In Section 3 we for mulate a\nversion of this invariant for group actions.\nLetXbe a compact, smooth oriented 4-manifold. Let Bbe a compact smooth\nmanifold of dimension dand suppose we have a smooth ﬁbrewise oriented ﬁbre\nbundleπX:EX→Bwhose ﬁbres are diﬀeomorphic to X. LetT(EX/B) =\nKer(πX∗) be the vertical tangent bundle.\nLetsXbe a Spinc-structure on X. We will assume that sXis monodromy\ninvariant under the monodromy action of π1(B) on the set of Spinc-structures on\nXinduced by the family EX. That is, we assume sXextends to give a continuously\nvarying family of Spinc-structures on the ﬁbres of EX. Note that this is in general\na weaker condition than requiring the existence of a Spinc-structure on T(EX/B)\nwhich restricts to sXon each ﬁbre. See Proposition 2.1 in [2] on this point.\nLet us ﬁrst consider the Z2-valued families Seiberg-Witten invariant, so we do\nnot have to consider orientations on the moduli space at this stage . The necessary\nmodiﬁcationsforthe Z-valuedfamilies Seiberg-Witteninvariantarestraightforward\nand will be dealt with later. Let\nd(X,sX) =c1(sX)2−σ(X)\n4−1−b+(X)+b1(X)\nbethevirtualdimensionoftheordinarySeiberg-Wittenmodulispac eofX. Assume\nthat\nb+(X)>d+1.\nThis assumption is necessary to have a well-deﬁned families Seiberg-W itten in-\nvariant. Under this assumption, for any family of ﬁbrewise metrics gXonEX,\nthere exists a families perturbation ηXonEXfor which the families moduli space\nM=M(EX,gX,ηX,sX) is a smooth manifold of dimension\ndim(M) =d(X,sX)+d\n(Mis empty if this number is negative). Here, if sXextends to a Spinc-structure\nonT(EX/B), the deﬁnition of the families moduli space Mis the standard one,\nsuch as discussed in [12]. However, in fact, even when sXdoes not extend, one can\ndeﬁne the families moduli space. See Subsection 2.2 in [2] on this point .\nSuppose that m≥0 is a non-negative integer and set s=dim(M)−2m. Now\nwe deﬁne the families invariant of interest. The invariant will be deﬁne d in the\nfollowing two cases. Assume that either:\n(i)m= 0, or\n(ii)b1(X) = 0 and sXextends to a Spinc-structure on T(EX/B), which we\ndenote by ˜sX.A GLUING FORMULA FOR FAMILIES SEIBERG-WITTEN INVARIANTS 7\nIncase(ii), weobtainalinebundle L → MoverMasfollows. Let G=Map(X,S1)\nbe the gauge group on X. Consider the subgroup G0ofGgiven by\nG0={g∈ G |g=eif,for somefwith/integraldisplay\nXfdvolX= 0}.\nSinceb1(X) = 0, weseethat thereisashortexactsequence1 → G0→ G →S1→1.\nIfweconsiderthefamiliesmodulispaceofsolutionstotheSeiberg-W ittenequations\ntaken modulo G0, we obtain a principal circle bundle over M, the families moduli\nspaceofsolutionsmodulo G, henceanassociatedlinebundle L → M. Notethatthis\nline bundle depends on the choice of extension of ˜sXofsX(see again Subsection 2.2\nin [2] on this point). In fact, since we assume b1(X) = 0, any two extensions diﬀer\nby the action of the pullback of a line bundle LB→B. Then it is easy to see that\nLchanges to L⊗π∗(LB), whereπ:M →Bis the natural map to B.\nDeﬁnition 2.1 (Families Z2-invariant) .Suppose that θ∈Hs(B,Z2). Now we\ndeﬁne the families invariant as follows:\n(i) Ifm= 0, thendim(M) =sand we set\nFSWZ2(EX,sX,θ) =/a\\}b∇acketle{tπ∗θ,[M]/a\\}b∇acket∇i}ht ∈Z2,\nwhere [M] is the fundamental class of MwithZ2-coeﬃcients.\n(ii) Ifm >0, then choose an extension ˜sXofsXto a Spinc-structure on\nT(EX/B). In turn this determines a line bundle L → M. We then set\nFSWZ2\nm(EX,˜sX,θ) =/a\\}b∇acketle{tc1(L)m∪π∗θ,[M]/a\\}b∇acket∇i}ht ∈Z2.\nThe condition b+(X)>d+1 ensures that FSWZ2(EX,sX,θ) does not depend\non the choice of metric or perturbation and so gives an invariant of t he family.\nIn case (ii), the invariant will in general depend on the choice of lift ˜sXofsX.\nHowever, to unify notation we will often write the invariant in case (ii) simply as\nFSWZ2m(EX,sX,θ), suppressing the dependence on the choice of lift ˜sX. This will\nbe justiﬁed later when we see that under certain conditions the inva riant is actually\nindependent of the choice of lift.\nRemark 2.2.Variant (ii) of Deﬁnition 2.3 can be deﬁned also for m= 0 in which\ncase it clearly coincides with variant (i): FSWZ2\n0(EX,˜sX,θ) =FSWZ2(EX,sX,θ).\nNext, we generalise the setup slightly to incorporate the so-called c harge conju-\ngation symmetry j. This construction was considered by Ruberman in the case of\n1-dimensional families in [17]. Recall that for any Spinc-structure sXonXthere is\na “dual” or “charge conjugate” Spinc-structure, which we will denote by −sX. We\nhave thatc1(−sX) =−c1(sX) and that sXcomes from a spin structure precisely\nwhensX=−sX. LetS±(sX) denote the spinor bundles associated to sX. Then\ncharge conjugation determines an antilinear isomorphism j:S±(sX)→S±(−sX)\nwith the property that j2=−1. Note that if sXcomes from a spin structure, then\njgives a quaternionic structure on S±(sX).\nLetπX:EX→Bbe a smooth family of 4-manifolds with ﬁbre X. Recall\nthatπ1(B) acts on the set of Spinc-structures by monodromy. We will consider\nfamilies where sXis preserved up to charge conjugation. Thus we assume there\nexists a homomorphism ρ:π1(B)→Z2such that the monodromy action of π1(B)\npreserves sXup to a sign factor given by ρ. Note that if sXdoes not come from\na spin structure, then ρis uniquely determined by the monodromy. On the other8 DAVID BARAGLIA, HOKUTO KONNO\nhand ifsXcomes from a spin structure, then ρmay be chosen arbitrarily, and this\nchoice gives rise to diﬀerent families Seiberg-Witten invariants.\nDeﬁned(X,sX) as before and assume that b+(X)> dim(B) + 1. View ρas a\nclass inH1(B,Z2). Represent ρas aZ2-valued cocycle ραβwith respect to some\nopen cover UαofB. We construct local families moduli spaces Mαover eachUα\nexactly as before. On the overlap Uα∩Uβ, we patch together MαandMβusing\nthe charge conjugation symmetry ( a,ψ)/mapsto→(−a,j(ψ)). Note that this gives us a\ngloballywell-deﬁnedmoduli space Mρbecausejsquarestoagaugetransformation.\nNote that if ηαare the locally deﬁned perturbation 2-forms, then for these to pa tch\ntogether we require ηα|Uαβ= (−1)ραβηβ|Uαβ. LetRρ→Bbe the real line bundle\nonBdetermined by ρ∈H1(B,Z2). Then the above patching condition on the\nperturbations {ηα}means that they patch together to give a global section ηof\nH+(X)⊗Rρ.\nDeﬁnition 2.3 (ρ-twisted families Z2-invariant) .Suppose that θ∈Hs(B,Z2),\nwheres=d(X,sX) +dim(B). Now we deﬁne the ρ-twisted families invariant as\nfollows:\nFSWZ2(EX,sX,θ,ρ) =/a\\}b∇acketle{tπ∗θ,[Mρ]/a\\}b∇acket∇i}ht ∈Z2,\nwhere [Mρ] is the fundamental class of MρwithZ2-coeﬃcients.\nNext we formulate a Z-valued version of the families Seiberg–Witten invariant.\nIn addition to all assumptions supposed when we deﬁned the Z2-valued invariant\n(Deﬁnition 2.3), let us assume that Bis oriented and ﬁx a homology orientation\nofX. Further, let det+(EX) denote the real line bundle on Bwhose ﬁbre over\nt∈Bisdet(H1(Xt,R)⊕H+(Xt)), whereXtdenote the ﬁbre of EXovertand\nH+(Xt)denotesthespaceofharmonicself-dual2-formson Xt(withrespecttosome\nsmoothly varying family of ﬁbrewise metrics). Suppose that det+(EX) is orientable\nand ﬁx an orientation on det+(EX). As in [12], this gives rise to an orientation of\nthe families moduli space Mfor a generic families perturbation, and thus we get\na fundamental class [ M] inZ-valued cohomology. By repeating Deﬁnition 2.3, we\nhave:\nDeﬁnition 2.4 (Families Z-invariant) .Suppose that θ∈Hs(B,Z). Now we deﬁne\nthe families invariant as follows:\n(i) Ifm= 0, thendim(M) =sand we set\nFSWZ(EX,sX,θ) =/a\\}b∇acketle{tπ∗θ,[M]/a\\}b∇acket∇i}ht ∈Z,\nwhere [M] is the fundamental class of MwithZ-coeﬃcients.\n(ii) Ifm >0, then choose an extension ˜sXofsXto a Spinc-structure on\nT(EX/B). In turn this determines a line bundle L → M. We then set\nFSWZ\nm(EX,˜sX,θ) =/a\\}b∇acketle{tc1(L)m∪π∗θ,[M]/a\\}b∇acket∇i}ht ∈Z.\nRemark 2.5.IfBordet+(EX) are non-orientable, we can still deﬁne Z-valued\nfamilies Seiberg-Witten invariants provided we work with local coeﬃcie nts. We can\nalso consider a Z-valuedρ-twisted families Seiberg-Witten invariant. For simplicity\nwe omit the details of these generalisations.\nWe here give a remark on a cohomological description of the families Se iberg–\nWitten invariants deﬁned above. The argument here is parallel for b othZ2-case\nandZ-case, and thereforewe drop the coeﬃcient from our notation of (co)homologyA GLUING FORMULA FOR FAMILIES SEIBERG-WITTEN INVARIANTS 9\nand from the families Seiberg-Witten invariant. First, recall that we can deﬁne the\nwrong way map\nπ∗:H∗(M)→H∗+dim(B)−dim(M)(B)\nby composing the usual pull-back π∗on cohomology and Poincar´ e duality for both\nMandB. Next, in the setting of Deﬁnition 2.3 or Deﬁnition 2.4, let us write\nagain the dimension of the families moduli space as dim(M) = 2m+sfor some\nnon-negative integer mands, and assume again that either:\n(i)m= 0, or\n(ii)b1(X) = 0 and sXextends to a Spinc-structure on T(EX/B), which we\ndenote by ˜sX.\nIn case (i), we set\nFSW(EX,sX) =π∗(1)∈H−d(X,sX)(B) =Hd−s(B),\nand in case (ii), we set\nFSWm(EX,sX) =π∗(c1(L)m)∈H2m−d(X,sX)(B) =Hd−s(B).\nThen we get the equality\nFSWm(EX,sX,θ) =/a\\}b∇acketle{tFSWm(EX,sX)∪θ,[B]/a\\}b∇acket∇i}ht (2.1)\nfor anyθ∈Hs(B,Z) because of the so-called projection formula. In particular,\nif we consider the Z2-coeﬃcient case, then equation (2.1) can be regarded as a\ndeﬁning property of the cohomology class FSW(EX,sX). Thus we will sometime\nview the families Seiberg-Witten invariant as the cohomology class FSW(EX,sX).\nAs well as in the untwisted case, note that we can regard the ρ-twisted families\ninvariant as a cohomology class\nFSWZ2(EX,sX,ρ)∈H−d(X,sX)(B,Z2).\n3.The Seiberg-Witten invariants of group actions\nIn this section we deﬁne a variant of the families Seiberg-Witten invar iant which\nis deﬁned for smooth group actions.\nLetXbe a smooth compact oriented 4-manifold and let Gbe a group acting\nonXby orientation preserving diﬀeomorphisms. Suppose that Gpreserves the\nisomorphism class of a Spinc-structure sX. Suppose that d(X,sX)≤0 and that\nb+(X)>−d(X,sX)+1. LetBbe any smooth compact manifold with dim(B)<\nb+(X)−1. LetE→Bbe aprincipal G-bundle over B(whereGisgiventhediscrete\ntopology). We obtain an associated family EX=E×GX→B. Associated to this\nfamily and Spinc-structure sXis the families Seiberg-Witten invariant:\nFSWZ2(EX,sX)∈H−d(X,sX)(B,Z2).\nIf we consider ( X,sX) and theG-action onXas ﬁxed data, then we may think of\nFSWZ2(EX,sX) as a map which assigns to each principal G-bundleE→Bover a\nbaseBwithdim(B)<b+(X)−1 a cohomology class in H−d(X,sX)(B,Z2). It turns\nout that this assignment is a characteristic class, that is, there ex ists a cohomology\nclass\nSWZ2\nG(X,sX)∈H−d(X,sX)(BG,Z2)\nsuch that if f:B→BGis the classifying map of E→Bthen\n(3.1) FSWZ2(EX,sX) =f∗(SWZ2\nG(X,sX)).10 DAVID BARAGLIA, HOKUTO KONNO\nThis follows easily from the existence of the characteristic classes SWZ2(X,sX)∈\nH−d(X,sX)(BDiff(X,sX),Z2) contructed by Konno [9]. Recall that if EX→B\nis any family of 4-manifolds with structure group Diff(X,sX) (the group of dif-\nfeomorphisms of Xpreserving the isomorphism class of sX), the families Seiberg-\nWitten invariant is given by\nFSWZ2(EX,sX) =g∗(SWZ2(X,sX)),\nwhereg:B→BDiff(X,sX) is the classifying map of EX→B. In the case that\nEXis of the form EX=E×GX, we have that gfactors as\nBf−→BGψ−→BDiff(X,sX),\nwhereψisthemapinducedfromthehomomorphism G→Diff(X,sX)determined\nby the action of GonX. Then Equation (3.1) follows immediately if we deﬁne\nSWZ2\nG(X,sX) to be:\n(3.2) SWZ2\nG(X,sX) =ψ∗(SWZ2(X,sX)).\nDeﬁnition 3.1. We deﬁne the G-equivariant Seiberg-Witten invariant of ( X,sX)\nwithZ2-coeﬃcients to be the class SWZ2\nG(X,sX)∈H−d(X,sX)(BG,Z2) deﬁned by\nEquation (3.2).\nWe can also consider a twisted version of the invariant SWZ2\nGas follows. Let X\nbe a smooth compact oriented 4-manifold and let Gbe a group acting on Xby\norientation preserving diﬀeomorphisms. Let ρ:G→Z2be a homomorphism and\nsuppose that Gpreserves a Spinc-structure sXup to a sign factor determined by ρ:\ng∗(sX) = (−1)ρ(g)sX,for allg∈G.\nSuppose as before that d(X,sX)≤0 and that b+(X)>−d(X,sX) +1. Then we\nobtain aρ-twistedG-equivariant Seiberg-Witten invariant\nSWZ2\nG(X,sX,ρ)∈H−d(X,sX)(BG,Z2).\nOne can also deﬁne the corresponding Z-valued invariants under suitable ori-\nentability assumptions. In all applications of these invariants that w e have consid-\nered so far, the Z2-invariant suﬃces. Hence we omit the details of the construction\nof theG-equivariant Z-valued Seiberg-Witten invariant.\nThe following proposition illustrates one of the possible applications of theG-\nequivariant Seiberg-Witten invariants:\nProposition 3.2. IfXadmits aG-invariant metric of positive scalar curvature\nthenSWZ2\nG(X,sX,ρ) = 0, whenever it is deﬁned.\nProof.Assume that Xadmits such a metric. To show that SWZ2\nG(X,sX,ρ) = 0 it\nsuﬃces to show that its pairing with any class β∈H−d(X,sX)(BG,Z2) is zero. By\nthe solution to the Steenrod problem with Z2-coeﬃcients, there exists a compact\nsmooth manifold Bof dimension −d(X,sX) and a continuous map f:B→BG\nsuch thatf∗[B] =β. LetE=f∗(EG) be the pullback of the universal bundle\nEG→BGand letEX=E×GXbe the family associated to E. Then\n/a\\}b∇acketle{tSWZ2\nG(X,sX,ρ),β/a\\}b∇acket∇i}ht=/a\\}b∇acketle{tf∗(SWZ2\nG(X,sX),ρ),[B]/a\\}b∇acket∇i}ht=/a\\}b∇acketle{tFSWZ2(EX,sX,ρ),[B]/a\\}b∇acket∇i}ht.\nSo it suﬃces to showthat FSWZ2(EX,sX,ρ) = 0. But a G-invariantmetric gonX\nwith positive scalar curvature determines a family {gb}b∈Bof ﬁbrewise metrics on\nEXwith positive scalar curvature. Since b+(X)>dim(B)+1 =−d(X,sX)+1 (byA GLUING FORMULA FOR FAMILIES SEIBERG-WITTEN INVARIANTS 11\nassumption) we can choose a families perturbation {ηb}b∈Bwhich avoidsthe wall of\nreducibles and we can in addition take the C0norm of the perturbations {ηb}b∈Bto\nbe suﬃciently small so that there are no irreducible solutions of the S eiberg-Witten\nequations for ( gb,ηb) for every b∈B. Thus the families Seiberg-Witten moduli\nspace is empty and hence FSWZ2(EX,sX,ρ) = 0. /square\n4.Setup for the general gluing construction\nIn this section we describe the formulation of a gluing result used to c alculate\nthe families invariant. This is a generalisation of Ruberman’s argument given in\n[19]. (See also [17, 18] for the Yang-Mills version.)\nOur gluing result can be proved for families that are obtained by a fam ilies\nconnected sum. Let M,Nbe compact, smooth, oriented 4-manifolds and set X=\nM#N. We assume throughout that b1(N) = 0. Let Bbe a compact smooth\nmanifold of dimension dand suppose we have smooth ﬁbrewise oriented families\nπM:EM→B,πN:EN→Bwhose ﬁbres are M,Nrespectively. Let T(EM/B) =\nKer(πM∗),T(EN/B) =Ker(πN∗) be the vertical tangent bundles. We wish to\nformaconnectedsumfamily.

By the isomorphism φwe can identify ι∗\nN(T(EN/B)) withVbut with the\noppositeorientation. Let D(V)→Bbe the unit open discbundle of VandS(V)→\nBthe unit sphere bundle. Let UM⊂EM,UN⊂ENbe tubular neighbourhoods of\nιM,ιNequipped with diﬀeomorphisms eM:D(V)→UM,eN:D(V)→UN, where\neMis orientation preserving and eNis orientation reversing.\nLetM′denoteMwith a small open ball removed and similarly deﬁne N′.

Similarly, the boundary of EN′\nis alsoS(V)→B, except the ﬁbres of S(V)→Binherit the opposite orientation\nfrom the family EN′.\nLetˆM,ˆNbe the cylindrical end 4-manifolds obtained from M′,N′by attaching\nthe half-inﬁnite cylinders [0 ,∞)×S3toM′and (−∞,0]×S3toN′. We obtain a\nfamilyEˆM→Bof cylindrical end 4-manifolds by attaching to EM′the family of\ncylinders [0 ,∞)×S(V) and we obtain a family EˆN→Bsimilarly.\nThe ﬁxedmetricon Vdeterminesfamilies ofﬁbrewisemetricson D(V)andS(V)\nwhichin turndeﬁneﬁbrewisemetricsonthe cylinders[0 ,∞)×S(V), (−∞,0]×S(V)\nbytakingtheproductwiththestandardmetric( dt)2ontheintervals[0 ,∞),(−∞,0].\nChoose a collar neighbourhood ( −ǫ,0]×S(V) of∂EM′and on this neighbourhood\nchoose the ﬁbrewise metric ( dt)2+gS(V)and extend this to a ﬁbrewise metric on\nall ofEM′.

We can carry out this construction in families giving a family\nEˆX(r)→Bwhich depends on r.\nThefamily EˆX(r)thatwehavejustconstructeddependsonnumerouschoices(fo r\nexample, on the choice of tubular neighbourhoods UM,UN). However it is not hard\nto see that up to isomorphism of families, the only data on which EˆX(r)depends\nis the tuple ( EM,EN,ιM,ιN,φ), where two families are considered isomorphic if\nthere is a diﬀeomorphism of their total spaces covering the identity onB. We will\nusually just write the family as EX, hiding the dependence of the various choices\ninvolved in its construction.\nLetsM,sNbe Spinc-structures on M,Nand letsXbe the Spinc-structure on\nXobtained as the connected sum of sMandsN. We will assume that sM,sNare\nmonodromy invariant under the monodromy action of π1(B) on the set of Spinc-\nstructures on MandNinduces by the families EM,EN. Put another way, we\nassumesM,sNextend to give continuously varying families of Spinc-structures on\nthe ﬁbres of EM,EN. Then likewise sXextends to a continuous family of Spinc-\nstructures on the ﬁbres of EˆX(r).\nLet us ﬁrst consider the Z2-valued families Seiberg-Witten invariant. We will\nassume that\nd(M,sM) =c1(sM)2−σ(M)\n4−1−b+(M)+b1(M)\nis even and non-negative, and deﬁne m≥0 byd(M,sM) = 2m. Next, we make the\nfollowing assumptions about N. Assume that:\nc1(sN)2=σ(N)\nso that the index of the Spinc-Dirac operator on Nis zero. Assume in addition\nthat:\n0<b+(N)≤dim(B) =d.\nRecall also that we are assuming b1(N) = 0. It follows that\nd(N,sN) =c1(sN)2−σ(N)\n4−1−b+(N)+b1(N) =−1−b+(N)<0.\nLetM=M(EˆX(r),gˆX(r),ηˆX(r),sX) be the Seiberg-Witten moduli space for the\nfamilyEˆX(r)and a choice of generic perturbation ηˆX(r)(for nowηˆX(r)is an ar-\nbitrary generic perturbation.

Recall that the families invariant FSWZ2(EX,sX,θ) is\ndeﬁned in the following cases:\n(i)d(M,sM) = 2m= 0, or\n(ii)b1(M) = 0 (hence also b1(X) = 0) and sXextends to a Spinc-structure on\nT(EX/B), which we denote by ˜sX.\nThe main gluing theorem of this paper is as follows:\nTheorem 4.1 (Z2-valued gluing formula) .Suppose that either\n(i)d(M,sM) = 2m= 0, or\n(ii)b1(M) =b1(X) = 0andsXextends to a Spinc-structure on T(EX/B).\nThen we have:\n(1)For anyθ∈Hs(B,Z2), we have\nFSWZ2m(EX,sX,θ) =SW(M,sM)·/a\\}b∇acketle{tθ∪wb+(N)(H+(N)),[B]/a\\}b∇acket∇i}ht\ninZ2. HereSW(M,sM)denotes the mod 2Seiberg-Witten invariant. In\nparticular, in case (ii), FSWZ2(EX,sX,θ)does not depend on the choice\nof extension ˜sXofsXto a Spinc-structure on T(EX/B).\n(2)For any integer k>0and anyθ∈Hs+2k(B,Z2), we have\nFSWZ2\nm−k(EX,sX,θ) = 0.\nRemark 4.2.In case (ii), the fact that FSWZ2m(EX,sX,θ) does not depend on\nthe choice of ˜sXfor anyθ∈Hs(B,Z2) can also be deduced from the fact that\nFSWZ2\nm−k(EX,sX,θ) = 0 for any θ∈Hs+2k(B,Z2), wherek>0.\nWe will prove parts (1) and (2) of Theorem 4.1 separately.\nSimilarly, we canalsoget ρ-twistedversionofTheoreom4.1. Instead ofassuming\nthatsM,sNare monodromy invariant under the monodromy action of π1(B), we\nhere assume that the monodromy preserves sM,sN,sXup to a common sign ρ:\nπ1(B)→Z2. Let us keep all other assumptions supposed before the stateme nt of\nTheorem 4.1. Then we have the following:\nTheorem 4.3 (ρ-twisted gluing formula) .Assume that the monodromy preserves\nsM,sN,sXup to a common sign ρ:π1(B)→Z2. Assume also that d(M,sM) =\n2m= 0, and suppose that we are given θ∈Hs(B,Z2).

In particular, in case (ii), FSWZ(EX,sX,θ)\ndoes not depend on the choice of extension ˜sXofsXto a Spinc-structure\nonT(EX/B).\n(2)For any integer k>0and anyθ∈Hs+2k(B,Z), we have\nFSWZ\nm−k(EX,sX,θ) = 0.\nRemark 4.5.One of the diﬀerences between Ruberman’s original gluing theorem\n[17, 18, 19] and ours is that we do not assume that our families of M#Nconsist\noftrivialfamilies of Mand families of N. In [17, 18, 19], Ruberman considered\ndiﬀeomorphisms which are supported on N, strictly speaking on N′, and therefore\nthe correspondingfamilies obtained by mapping tori can be regarde das the families\nconnected sum of trivial families of Mand (typically non-trivial) families of N. On\ntheotherhand,weshallalsoconsiderdiﬀeomorphismson M#Nactingnon-trivially\nnot only on Nbut also on M. In the subsequent sections, this generalisation is\neﬀectively used when we shall give examples of 4-manifolds which admit positive\nscalar curvature metrics but do not admit Z2-invariant positive scalar curvature\nmetrics for suitable Z2-actions on them.\n5.Proof of gluing formula, first step\nWe ﬁrst concern ourselves with part (1) of Theorem 4.1. In this sec tion we will\nshow that it suﬃces to prove part (1) of Theorem 4.1 in the case tha ts= 0, that\nis, in the case dim(B) =b+(N).\nSuppose the theorem holds in the case s= 0. Now we will prove the general\ntheorem. Let θ∈Hs(B,Z2).

The\nmain diﬀerence is that the Steenrod problem can only be solved up to a multiple.\nThat is, given θ∈Hs(B,Z), there is some positive integer Nsuch that we can rep-\nresentNθasf∗[S] for somef:S→B. But if the Z-valued version of Theorem 4.1\nholds forNθ, then by cancelling out the factor of Non both sides, we get that the\ntheorem also holds for θitself.\nSo for the remainder of the proof of part (1) of Theorem 4.1 we may assume\nthat:\ndim(B) =d=b+(N).\n6.Gluing theory for the Seiberg-Witten equations\n6.1.Review of gluing theory. To proceed further with the proof of Theorem\n4.1, we need to employ a parametrised version of the gluing construc tion for the\nSeiberg-Witten equations on connected sums. Our main reference will be Nico-\nlaescu’s book [15], and we will refer to [15] as “Nicolaescu’s book” or ju st simply\n“Nicolaescu”. In this section, let us ﬁrst brieﬂy review the ordinary case of this\nconstruction, i.e. the unparametrised case.\nWe have 4-manifolds M,Nand their connected sum X=M#N. Recall that\nwe deﬁned the cylindrical end 4-manifolds ˆM,ˆNand we attached them to form\nˆX(r), whereris a positive real number. Each ˆX(r) is diﬀeomorphic to X, but\nthe length of the neck of ˆX(r) grows proportionally with r. To make the analysis\nwork well on cylindrical end manifolds, one considers weighted Sobole v spacesLk,p\nµ,\nwhereµ∈Ris the weight, and the extended Sobolev spaces Lk,p\nµ,exfollowing Atiyah-\nPatodi-Singer[1], calledthe asymptoticallycylindricalsectionsin Nicola escu’sbook\n(page 299 in Subsection 4.1.4), to deal with asymptotic values.\nHereηˆMis the self-dual 2-form perturbation, which is assumed to be suppo rted\naway from the neck and sˆMis an asymptotically cylindrical Spinc-structure on ˆM.\nIsomorphism classes of such Spinc-structures are in bijection with Spinc-structures\nonM(this follows from the fact that our 3-manifold used for gluing, deno ted by\n∂∞ˆMin Nicolaescu’s book, is just S3andH1(S3,Z) =H2(S3,Z) = 0. See Nico-\nlaescu for more details on asymptotically cylindrical Spinc-structures). Therefore\nwewillsimplyidentify sˆMwithsMwithout furthermention. Wehaveisomorphisms\nH2\nL2(ˆM)∼=H2(ˆM,[0,∞)×S3,R)∼=H2(ˆM,R)∼=H2(M,R),\nwhereH2\nL2(ˆM) is the space of L2-integrable harmonic 2-forms on ˆM. The ﬁrst\nisomorphism is shown by Atiyah-Patodi-Singer [1], the second isomorp hism is just\nthe long exact sequence for cohomology of the pair ( ˆM,[0,∞)×S3) and the third\nisomorphism can be obtained from the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. Th us theL2-\nsecond Betti number of ˆMcoincides with the ordinary second Betti number of M.\nNote also that this isomorphism depends only on the choice of metric gˆM.\nNext, observe that H2\nL2(ˆM) is equipped with a natural bilinear form, the L2-\nintersection form:\n(α,β) =/integraldisplay\nˆMα∧β.16 DAVID BARAGLIA, HOKUTO KONNO\nOn the other hand, Poincar´ e Lefschetz duality implies that the cup product de-\ntermines a non-degenerate bilinear form on the image of H2(ˆM,[0,∞)×S3,R)\ninH2(ˆM,R). In our case, the image is all of H2(ˆM,R) and under the isomor-\nphism with H2(M,R), coincides with the usual intersection form on M. The\nisomorphism given by Atiyah-Patodi-Singer between H2\nL2(ˆM) and the image of\nH2(ˆM,[0,∞)×S3,R) inH2(ˆM,R) can be shown to respect the intersection forms.\nTherefore, in our case we have an isomorphism H2\nL2(ˆM)∼=H2(M,R) such that the\nL2-intersection form on H2\nL2(ˆM) coincides with the topological intersection form\nonH2(M,R). LetH+\nL2(ˆM) denote the subspace of H2\nL2(ˆM) consisting of self-dual\nL2-harmonic 2-forms. It follows immediately that the dimension of H+\nL2(ˆM) equals\nb+(M).\nRemark 6.1.In the families setting, given the family EˆM→Band family {gˆM}\nof ﬁbrewise metrics, we have that H+\nL2(ˆM) andH2(M,R) can be thought of as\nvector bundles on B, equipped with bilinear forms. The isomorphism H+\nL2(ˆM)∼=\nH2(M,R) depends only on the choice of metric gˆMand so in the families setting,\nwe get that H+\nL2(ˆM)∼=H2(M,R) is an isomorphism of vector bundles with bilinear\nforms.\nIt is shown in Nicolaescu that if b+(M)>0, then the perturbation ηˆMcan be\nchosen so as to avoid any reducible solutions of the Seiberg-Witten e quations, and\nfor generic such ηˆM, the moduli space M(ˆM,gˆM,ηˆM,sˆM,µ) is a smooth compact\nmanifold of dimension d(M,s) (the same dimension as the Seiberg-Witten moduli\nspacefor(M,sM)). Compactnessdependscruciallyontheassumptionthat ∂∞ˆM=\nS3. More precisely, within the space of 2-form perturbations on ˆMsupported away\nfrom the neck, the ones for which a reducible solution exists form a c losed subspace\nof codimension b+(M). We will discuss this in more detail in Section 7.\nGiven a solution\nˆC= (ˆA,ˆψ)∈ M(ˆM,gˆM,ηˆM,sˆM,µ)\nof the Seiberg-Witten equations on ˆM, one can consider the deformation theory of\nˆC. One obtains a three-term deformation complex, denoted by ˆKˆCin Nicolaescu’s\nbook, which controls the deformation theory. For i= 0,1,2, letHi\nˆCdenote the\ni-th cohomology of ˆKˆC. These groups have the usual interpretations: H0\nˆCis the\nLie algebra of inﬁnitesimal automorphisms, hence H0\nˆC= 0 ifˆCis irreducible and\nH0\nˆC=RifˆCis reducible. H1\nˆCisthe virtualtangent spaceand H2\nˆCisthe obstruction\nspace. The local structure of the moduli space around ˆCis given by a Kuranishi\nmodelH1\nˆC⊇UQ−→H2\nˆC, for some obstruction map Q.\nAs in the compact case, an application of Sard-Smale shows that for generic per-\nturbationsηˆM, we haveH2\nˆC= 0 for every irreducible solution of the ηˆM-perturbed\nSeiberg-Witten equations on ˆM.\nNow we turn to gluing (see Nicolaescu’s book §4.5). The idea is roughly as fol-\nlows: let ˆCMbe a solution of the Seiberg-Witten equations on ˆMandˆCNbe a\nsolution of the Seiberg-Witten equations on ˆNwhich agree asymptotically. If ˆCM\nandˆCNwere cylindrical, then we could identify them on the necks of ˆM(r),ˆN(r)\nto obtain a genuine solution of the Seiberg-Witten equations on ˆX(r). In general,A GLUING FORMULA FOR FAMILIES SEIBERG-WITTEN INVARIANTS 17\nˆCM,ˆCNare only asymptotically cylindrical. We can still glue them together on\nˆX(r) with the aid of cutoﬀ functions to form a glued conﬁguration ˆCr=ˆCM#rˆCN\nonˆX(r). But the cutoﬀ functions introduce error terms so that ˆCris only an ap-\nproximate solution of the Seiberg-Witten equations on ˆX(r). Ifris very large, then\nthe erroris verysmall and ˆCris veryclose to being a solution. If ηˆM,ηˆNarepertur-\nbations on ˆM,ˆNsupported away from the necks, then they can be glued together\nto form a perturbation ηˆX(r)=ηˆM#rηˆNonˆX(r) (the gluing is straightforward\nbecauseηˆM,ηˆNboth vanish along the necks). Using a variant of the Kuranishi\nmodel, one obtains a local description on the moduli space of genuine solutions\nwhich are suﬃciently close to ˆCr. Since this step is of crucial importance, we will\ncarefully review the construction in the next section.\nRemark 6.2.Henceforth the notation # rmeans the gluing by a speciﬁed cutoﬀ\nfunctions according to Nicolaescu’s book. Note that in some literatu res the oper-\nation #rmay be called a pre-gluing rather than gluing. (In such a case the word\n“gluing ” is used only for a genuine solution near an approximating conﬁ guration\nobtained from # r.) However in this paper we often call the operation # rsimply a\ngluing.\n6.2.Gluing monopoles: local theory. In Section 7, we shall describe a gluing\nargument for families. Roughly speaking, our argument is to estimat e some errors\noccurring from the base space direction compared with the unpara metrised case.\nAs a preliminary of this forthcoming argument, in this section we shall recall some\nestimates in the local theory on gluing in unparameterized case. We w ill mostly\nadopt the notations of Section 4 in Nicolaescu’s book.\nChoose strongly cylindrical connections (see Nocolaescu’s book Ex ample 4.1.2)\nˆA0,M,ˆA0,Nondet(sM),det(sN) respectively which can be assumed compatible (re-\ncall that compatible means their asymptotic values agree) and set\nˆA0=ˆA0(r) =ˆA0,M#rˆA0,N.\nLetˆCµ,ex(ˆM),ˆCµ,ex(ˆN) be the conﬁguration spaces consisting of asymptotically\ncylindrical data, deﬁned on page 369 in Subsection 4.3.1 in Nicolaescu’s book. For\nˆC∈ˆCµ,ex(ˆM) orˆCµ,ex(ˆN), we will denote by ∂∞ˆCthe asymptotic value of ˆC. If\nˆCM∈ˆCµ,ex(ˆM) andˆCN∈ˆCµ,ex(ˆN) are two smooth monopoles such that\n∂∞ˆCM=∂∞ˆCN,\nthen we can form\nˆCr= (ˆψr,ˆAr) =ˆCM#rˆCN= (ˆψM#rˆψN,ˆAM#rˆAN).\nonˆX(r), where ˆX(r) is theclosed4-manifoldobtainedfrom ˆMandˆNhavinganeck\nof lengthr. Of course, the resulting conﬁguration ˆCris usually not a solution of the\nSeiberg-Witten equations since we used cutoﬀ functions to form ˆCras we explained\nin Section 6.1. We would like to show there exist genuine monopoles near ˆCr. For\nthis we consider a variant of the Kuranishi model for a non-linear Fr edholm map\nf:V→Wbetween Banach spaces. Normally one assumes f(0) = 0 and studies\nthe structure of the zero set f−1(0) near 0. In our case, we are still interested in\nthe zero set f−1(0) but we can have f(0)/\\e}atio\\slash= 0.\nLetˆCr∈ˆC(ˆX(r)) be the conﬁguration obtained by gluing two monopoles using\ncutoﬀ functions, as above. Let us denote by S+andS−the positive and negative18 DAVID BARAGLIA, HOKUTO KONNO\nspinor bundles respectively. We also use the notation ∧2\n+to indicate the self-dual\npart. As in Subsection 4.5.2 in Nicolaescu’s book, form the non-linear m ap\nN:L2,2(ˆX(r),S+⊕iT∗ˆX(r))→L1,2(ˆX(r),S−⊕i∧2\n+T∗ˆX(r)⊕iR)\ngiven by\nN(ˆC) =/hatwidestSW(ˆC+ˆCr)⊕L∗\nˆCr(ˆC).\nHere the term /hatwidestSW(ˆC+ˆCr) denotes the Seiberg-Witten equations and L∗\nˆCr(ˆC) does\nthe gauge ﬁxing condition relative to ˆCr.

The corresponding Higgs branch, which is the symplectic reduction\nN\bN\u0003= = =G=\u0016\u00001(0)= =G(seex1), is nothing but a quiver variety of a\u000ene type A. We\ndenote it by M0(\u0015;\u0016). In standard notation for a quiver variety, it is usually denoted\nbyM0(v;w). Taking a character \u001f:G!C\u0002given by the product of determinants\nof factors GL( Vi), we can consider a GIT quotient \u0016\u00001(0)= =\u001fG. Let us denote it\nbyM\u001f(\u0015;\u0016).

(Heredis the so-called degree operator.) Integrable highest weight\nrepresentations are natural analog of \fnite dimensional irreducible representationsGEOMETRIC SATAKE FOR AFFINE LIE ALGEBRAS 3\nofsl(n). They are classi\fed by dominant integral weights (i.e. highest weights), n-\ntuple of nonnegative integers in this case. For the representation in (2), the highest\nweight is given by \u0015, which was essentially (dim Wi)i2Z=nZas we mentioned above.\nLet us denote the corresponding integrable highest weight representation by V(\u0015).\nIts weight\u0016subspace is denoted by V\u0016(\u0015).\nLet us note thatL\n\u0016Htop(L\u001f(\u0015;\u0016)) has a distinguished base given by fun-\ndamental classes of irreducible components of L\u001f(\u0015;\u0016). It is known that the setF\n\u0016IrrL\u001f(\u0015;\u0016) of irreducible components has a structure of Kashiwara crystal iso-\nmorphic to one for crystal base of Uq(sl(n)a\u000b)-version for V(\u0015). See [ KS97, Sai02,\nNak01b ]. We do not give a presice explain of its meaning (which requires to recall\nthe de\fnition of Kashiwara crystal): it vaguely means that there is a recursive way\nto parametrize irreducible components of L\u001f(\u0015;\u0016) with varying \u0016starting from the\nhighest weight vector L\u001f(\u0015;0) =f0g. In fact, this recursive structure was used to\nshow that the above representation is of highest weight.\nOur goal is to relate the Coulomb branch M(\u0015;\u0016) tosl(n)a\u000b. In fact, we\nconjecture that we have a similar relation for Coulomb branches for general quiver\ngauge theories. An a\u000ene type Aquiver is special, as Coulomb branches have\ndescription as Cherkis bow varieties [ NT17 ], which can be de\fned by symplectic\nreduction of certain \fnite dimensional symplectic manifolds (products of vector\nspaces and Slodowy slices of type A). This description is crucially used in the proof\nof the main result Theorem 12.4 below, although we hide it from the statement\nin order to make the length of this article reasonable. We lack tools to establish\nvarious expected properties of Coulomb branches of general quiver gauge theories,\nsuch as \fniteness of symplectic leaves, description of leaves, etc.\nIn order to illustrate a formal similarity between two constructions, one in\nTheorem 11.1 and another in Theorem 12.4, let us brie\ry review the de\fnition of\nsl(n)a\u000brepresentation, formulated in a slightly di\u000berent manner from the original.\nWe use a presentation of sl(n)a\u000bas a Kac-Moody Lie algebra: it is generated\nby elements ei,fi,hi(i2Z=nZ),dwith certain de\fning relations which we omit.\nOperatorshi,dare given by dimensions of Vi,Wion the component Htop(L\u001f(\u0015;\u0016)),\nhence not so interesting.

Let us review the construction of tensor product\nrepresentations in [ Nak01b ], which was motivated by earlier works by Lusztig\n[Lus99 ] and Varagnolo-Vasserot [ VV02 ].\nRecall that (dim Wi)i2Z=nZgives the highest weight in Theorem 11.1. We con-\nsider a decomposition W=W1\bW2ofZ=nZ-graded vector spaces, which will be\nrelated to the tensor product of representations with highest weights \u00151,\u00152, which\ncorrespond to (dim W1\ni) and (dimW2\ni). The following construction depends on the\nordering of W1,W2, though the resulted tensor product does not.

In order to see that the representation has a correct `size', let us describe\nirreducible components of eT\u0017\u000f\n\u001f(\u0015;\u0016).

To\nshow that it is an isomorphism, one uses that M\u001f(\u0015;\u0016) is smooth and a \fne moduli\nspace. See [ Nak01b , Lemma 3.2] for detail. For a point x2eT\u0017\u000f\n\u001f(\u0015;\u0016), the limit\nlimt!0txis a\u0017\u000f-\fxed point. According to the above decomposition, we have the\ninduced decomposition\neT\u0017\u000f\n\u001f(\u0015;\u0016) =G\n\u0016=\u00161+\u00162eT\u0017\u000f\n\u001f(\u00151;\u00161;\u00152;\u00162):\nTheneT\u0017\u000f\n\u001f(\u00151;\u00161;\u00152;\u00162) is a vector bundle over L\u001f(\u00151;\u00161)\u0002L\u001f(\u00152;\u00162), where the\nprojection to the base is identi\fed with the map given by lim t!0tx.

Now irreducible\ncomponents of eT\u0017\u000f\n\u001f(\u0015;\u0016) is in bijection toF\n\u0016=\u00161+\u00162IrrL\u001f(\u00151;\u00161)\u0002IrrL\u001f(\u00152;\u00162):\nLet us give an example. Let V=LVi,Vi=C(1\u0014i\u0014n\u00001),V0= 0,\nW=LWi,Wi=C(i= 1;n\u00001),Wi= 0 (i= 0 or 1< i < n\u00001). (We\nunderstand W1=C2,W0= 0 whenn= 2.) The corresponding quiver variety\nM0(\u0015;\u0016) isC2=(Z=nZ), i.e. the simple singularity of type An\u00001, and M\u001f(\u0015;\u0016)\nis its minimal resolution. The lagrangian subvariety L\u001f(\u0015;\u0016) consists of a chain\nofn\u00001 complex projective lines. We take a decomposition W=W1\bW2with\ndimW1= dimW2= 1. The \fxed point set M\u001f(\u0015;\u0016)\u0017\u000fconsists ofnisolated points,\nwhich are south and north poles of projective lines. There are ( n\u00002) intersection\npoints among them, and the remaining two are extremal points of the chain. Thus\nwe have one additional irreducible component in eT\u0017\u000f\n\u001f(\u0015;\u0016). Depending on a choice\nof the decomposition W=W1\bW2, we choose an either of lines through two\nextremal points. See Figure 1. The additional irreducible component is drawn by\na dotted line.\nIn representation theoretic term this corresponds to the tensor product repre-\nsentation Cn\u0002(Cn)\u0003ofsl(n), where Cnis the vector representation and ( Cn)\u0003is its\ndual. It decomposes into the sum of sl(n) (adjoint representation) and Cid (trivial\nrepresentation). The additional irreducible component gives the trivial representa-\ntion summand.\nFigure 1.eT\u0017\u000f\n\u001f(\u0015;\u0016)6 H. NAKAJIMA\nRemark 11.4. Combining Theorem 11.1 with Theorem 11.3, we see that there is\nan isomorphism\n(11.5) Htop(eT\u0017\u000f\n\u001f(\u0015;\u0016))\u0018=M\n\u0016=\u00161+\u00162Htop(L\u001f(\u00151;\u00161))\nHtop(L\u001f(\u00152;\u00162)):\nBut the above argument only gives an existence of an isomorphism, and does not\ngive a particular isomorphism. Since the tensor product V(\u00151)\nV(\u00152) is not\nirreducible in general, such an isomorphism is not unique. For quiver varieties of\n\fnite type, this ambiguity was \fxed by regarding one of tensor factors as a lowest\nweight module. See [ Nak01b , Th. 5.9]. The stable envelope introduced by Maulik-\nOkounkov [ MO12 ] gives a canonical isomorphism in a geometric way for quiver\nvarieties of general types.\nRemark 11.6. The construction can be easily generalized to the case when we\ndecompose Winto more factors, say W=W1\bW2\bW3. It corresponds to the\ntriple tensor product V(\u00151)\nV(\u00152)\nV(\u00153).\nFor quiver varieties of a\u000ene type A(and more generally when the underly-\ning Dynkin diagram contains a loop) there is another type of one parameter sub-\ngroup acting on M0(\u0015;\u0016),M\u001f(\u0015;\u0016): we consider the dilatation action on the factor\nHom(Vn\u00001;V0) and the induced action on M0(\u0015;\u0016),M\u001f(\u0015;\u0016). The \fxed point set\ninM\u001f(\u0015;\u0016) with respect to this action is union of quiver varieties of type A1, i.e.\nthose de\fned by replacing Z=nZ-grading above by Z-grading. The embedding is\ngiving by regarding Z-grading modulo n.\nThe corresponding attracting set realizes a representation which is induced by\nthe homomorphism sl(n)a\u000b!bgl(1), where the latter is the central extension of\nthe Lie algebra of matrices ( aij)i;j2Zwithaij= 0 forji\u0000jj\u001d0. (See [ KRR13 ].)\n11(iii). Sheaf theoretic formulation. In order to make analogy between\nTheorem 11.1 and Theorem 12.4 closer, we further reformulate the above de\fnition\nusing perverse sheaves. A reader who is unfamiliar with sheaf theoretical formula-\ntion of convolution products should skip this and next subsections.\nIt is known [ Nak98 , Cor. 10.11] that \u0019:M\u001f(\u0015;\u0016)!M0(\u0015;\u0016) is semismall\n(when we replace the target by the image of \u0019). Therefore the direct image\n\u0019!(CM\u001f(\u0015;\u0016)) over M\u001f(\u0015;\u0016) is a semisimple perverse sheaf. Here CXdenote the\nconstant sheaf shifted by dim X, i.e.CX[dimX]. The point 0 is a stratum and we\nhave\nHtop(L\u001f(\u0015;\u0016))\u0018=Hom(C0;\u0019!(CM\u001f(\u0015;\u0016)));\nwhere the Hom in the right hand side is taken in the abelian category of perverse\nsheaves on M0(\u0015;\u0016) (locally constant along a certain natural strati\fcation).\nAs we remarked above, \u0019factors through M\u001fi(\u0015;\u0016). Let us denote maps by \u00190,\n\u001900so that\u0019=\u00190\u000e\u001900. Then\u001900is also semismall, and \u001900\n!(CM\u001f(\u0015;\u0016)) is a semisimple\nperverse sheaf on M\u001fi(\u0015;\u0016). It decomposes a direct sum of intersection cohomology\ncomplexes of various strata. (One can show that no intersection cohomology com-\nplexes associated with nontrivial local system appear. cf. [ Nak01a , Prop. 15.3.2].)\nLet us write the decomposition as\n\u001900\n!(CM\u001f(\u0015;\u0016))\u0018=M\n\u000bL\u000b\nIC(M\u000b\n\u001fi);\nwhere M\u000b\n\u001fiare relevant strata, and L\u000bis the top degree homology of the \fber over a\npoint in a stratum M\u000b\n\u001fi. It is also known that a stratum is of a form Ms\n\u001fi(\u0015;\u0016+k\u000bi)GEOMETRIC SATAKE FOR AFFINE LIE ALGEBRAS 7\nwith a nonnegative integer k. Here the superscript `s' means the locus of stable\npoints. See [ Nak09 , Prop. 2.25].\nSince\u0019=\u00190\u000e\u001900, we have\nHtop(L\u001f(\u0015;\u0016))\u0018=M\n\u000bL\u000b\nHom(C0;\u00190\n!IC(M\u000b\n\u001fi)):\nThe strati\fcation M\u001fi(\u0015;\u0016) =FM\u000b\n\u001fiis compatible with the closed embedding\nM\u001fi(\u0015;\u0016),!M\u001fi(\u0015;\u0016\u0000\u000bi), hence we may write also\nHtop(L\u001f(\u0015;\u0016\u0000\u000bi))\u0018=M\n\u000bL0\n\u000b\nHom(C0;\u00190\n!IC(M\u000b\n\u001fi))\nby settingL\u000b= 0 if M\u000b\n\u001fiis a new stratum appearing in M\u001fi(\u0015;\u0016\u0000\u000bi).\nBy the de\fnition of ei,fiabove, they respect the decomposition, i.e. they are\ntensor products of operators L\u000b\u001cL0\n\u000band the identity operator of Hom( C0;\u00190\n!IC(M\u000b\n\u001fi)):\nBy a local description of a quiver variety (see [ Nak01a ,x3]), the \fber over\na point a stratum M\u000b\n\u001fiis isomorphic to the central \fber L\u001fof another quiver\nvariety, which is of \fnite type A1in the present case. The construction of ei,fiis\ncompatible with this description, namely operators L\u000b\u001cL0\n\u000bare given by applying\nthe construction in the previous subsection for quiver varieties of \fnite type A1.\nQuiver varieties of \fnite type A1are cotangent bundles of Grassmanian [ Nak94 ,\nx7], and the construction coincides with one done earlier by Ginzburg [ Gin91 ] in\nthis case.\nFrom this explanation it is clear that dimension of Hom( C0;\u00190\n!IC(M\u000b\n\u001fi)) is equal\nto the multiplicity of an irreducible representation in the restriction\nV(\u0015)#sl(n)aff\nli\nwhere liis the Levi factor corresponding to i. See [ Nak09 ]. In the current situation\nliis the direct sum of sl2and an abelian Lie algebra. The index \u000bcorresponds to\nthe highest weight of an irreducible representation of li. The nonemptyness of\nMs\n\u001fi(V0;W) implies that dim Wi+ dimVi\u00001+ dimVi+1\u00152 dimVi, hence it is\ndominant for li.\n11(iv). Sheaf theoretic formulation for tensor products. Let us con-\ntinue sheaf theoretic formulation of results above. We turn to Theorem 11.3. We\nreview [ Nak13 ].\nWe consider the diagram\nM0(\u0015;\u0016)\u0017\u000fp \u0000T\u0017\u000f\n0(\u0015;\u0016)j\u0000 !M0(\u0015;\u0016);\nwherejis the inclusion and pis given by lim t!0\u0017\u000f(t)\u0001. We de\fne the hyperbolic\nrestriction functor \b by p\u0003j!. Its fundamental properties are discussed in [ Bra03,\nDG14 ]. In particular, \b sends \u0019!(CM\u001f(\u0015;\u0016)) to a direct sum of simple perverse\nsheaves with shifts.\nMoreover, in the current situation, \b \u0019!(CM\u001f(\u0015;\u0016)) is a semisimple perverse sheaf,\ni.e. no shifts are necessary. This is because \b is hyperbolic semi-small in the sense\nof [BFN16c ]. This is, in turn, a consequence of Theorem 11.3(1). Now the top\ndegree homology and the hyperbolic restriction are related by\nHtop(eT\u0017\u000f\n\u001f(\u0015;\u0016))\u0018=Hom(C0;\b\u0019!(CM\u001f(\u0015;\u0016))):\nSee [Nak13 , the paragraph after Lemma 4].8 H. NAKAJIMA\nThe statement (2) in Theorem 11.3 could be regarded as a computation of the\nhyperbolic restriction \b \u0019!(CM\u001f(\u0015;\u0016)). Let\n\u001b:G\n\u0016=\u00161+\u00162M0(\u00151;\u00161)\u0002M0(\u00152;\u00162)!M0(\u0015;\u0016)\u0017\u000f\ndenote a morphism given by sum, which is \fnite and surjective [ Nak13 , Lemma\n1].\nLemma 11.7 ([Nak13 , Lemma 3]) .We have an isomorphism\n\u001b!M\n\u0016=\u00161+\u00162(\u0019\u0002\u0019)!CM\u001f(\u00151;\u00161)\u0002M\u001f(\u00152;\u00162)\u0018=\b\u0019!(CM\u001f(\u0015;\u0016)):\nThis is a consequence of description of eT\u0017\u000f\n\u001f(\u0015;\u0016) inx11(ii).\nTaking a \fber at 0, we obtain the isomorphism (11.5). As we mentioned in\nRemark 11.4, (11.5) is not unique. The same is true in the above situation. We can\nalso show that the stable envelope gives a canonical isomorphism also in above. It\nis a consequence of [ Nak13 , Lemma 4].\n12. Coulomb branches and a\u000ene Lie algebras\n12(i). Integrable highest weight representations. We return back to the\nCoulomb branchM(\u0015;\u0016) of a quiver gauge theory of a\u000ene type A. As we explained\ninx3, the Coulomb branch has a quantization, and hence a Poisson bracket. It is\nshown that it gives a symplectic form on the smooth locus as a statement for\ngeneral Coulomb branches. In our case M(\u0015;\u0016), a \fner statement is known: The\ndecomposition into symplectic leaves are given by\n(12.1) M(\u0015;\u0016) =G\n\u0014;kMs(\u0014;\u0016)\u0002Sk(C2nf0g=(Z=nZ));\nwherek= [k1;k2;:::] is a partition, and \u0014is a dominant weight with \u0015\u0000jkj\u000e\u0015\n\u0014\u0015\u0016. AndMs(\u0014;\u0016) is the regular locus of M(\u0014;\u0016) if dimW6= 1 or\u0014=\u0016and;\notherwise. See [ NT17 , Th. 7.26].\nRecall that we have chosen a character \u001f:G!C\u0002given by the product of\ndeterminants. We consider the induced homomorphism \u00191(\u001f):\u00191(G)!\u00191(C\u0002)\nand its Pontryagin dual \u00191(\u001f)^:\u00191(C\u0002)^!\u00191(G)^. Byx6(iii)\u00191(G)^acts on\nM(\u0015;\u0016). In our case we have \u00191(G)^= (C\u0002)n. (We assume Vi6= 0 for all ifor\nbrevity.) Via \u00191(C\u0002)^=C\u0002, we consider \u00191(\u001f)^as a one parameter subgroup in\n\u00191(G)^= (C\u0002)n. Let us write \u00191(\u001f)^by\u001ffor brevity.\nThe following was proved in [ NT17 , Prop. 7.30] (see also [ Nak18b , Prop. 4.1]):\nLemma 12.2. The \fxed point set M(\u0015;\u0016)\u001fis either empty or a single point.\nIn analogy with (11.2) we introduce the attracting set\nA\u001f(\u0015;\u0016)def:=n\nx2M (\u0015;\u0016)\f\f\flim\nt!0\u001f(t)xexistso\n:\nNote that a tilde version is same by the above lemma.\nRemark 12.3.

Our de\fnition of Coulomb branches is given so that\nthis is established rigorously.\nNow we state the main result\nTheorem 12.4 ([Nak18b ]).(1)Every intersection with A\u001f(\u0015;\u0016)and a symplectic\nleaf ofM(\u0015;\u0016)is either empty or a lagrangian subvariety in the leaf.\n(2)The direct sumM\n\u0016Htop(A\u001f(\u0015;\u0016))\nof top degree homology groups of A\u001f(\u0015;\u0016)over\u0016has a structure of an integrable\nhighest weight representation V(\u0015)of an a\u000ene Lie algebra sl(n)a\u000bwith highest\nweight\u0015.\nAs we already mentioned, the construction in Theorem 12.4 is formally sim-\nilar to one in Theorem 11.1. We de\fne operators dandei,fi,hi(i2Z=nZ).\nThe operators dandhiare determined by dimension vectors, namely they are\nde\fned so that Htop(A\u001f(\u0015;\u0016)) is identi\fed with V\u0016(\u0015). Operators ei,fiare de-\n\fned via study of varieties associated with another character \u001fi. Namely we\nconsider the \u001fi-\fxed point setM(\u0015;\u0016)\u001fiand the attracting set A\u001fi(\u0015;\u0016)def:=\nfx2M (\u0015;\u0016)jlimt!0\u001fi(t)xexistsg:We also consider the \u001fi-\fxed point set A\u001f(\u0015;\u0016)\u001fi\nin the attracting set A\u001f(\u0015;\u0016). Then the original attracting set is the \fber product:\n(12.5) A\u001f(\u0015;\u0016) =A\u001f(\u0015;\u0016)\u001fi\u0002M(\u0015;\u0016)\u001fiA\u001fi(\u0015;\u0016);\nwhere the morphism A\u001fi(\u0015;\u0016)!M (\u0015;\u0016)\u001fiis given by lim t!0\u001f(t)\u0001.\nWe then show that M(\u0015;\u0016)\u001fis either empty or isomorphic to the Coulomb\nbranchMA1(\u00150;\u00160) of typeA1quiver gauge theory with some \u00150,\u00160. Thus A\u001f(\u0015;\u0016)\u001fi\nis the attracting set in the Coulomb branch of type A1quiver gauge theory.\nThis picture enables us to de\fne operators ei,fiby a reduction to the sl(2)\ncase. This is formally similar to the method used in Theorem 11.1.

It can be shown that\nthe setFIrrA\u001f(\u0015;\u0016) of irreducible components has a structure of Kashiwara crystal\nisomorphic to one for crystal base of Uq(sl(n)a\u000b)-version of V(\u0015).

NAKAJIMA\nRecallM(\u0015;\u0016)\u001fis either empty or a single point by Lemma 12.2. And in\nview of Theorem 12.4, it is a single point if and only if V\u0016(\u0015)6= 0. Therefore the\nabove lemma says that M\u0017\u000f;C(\u0015;\u0016)\u001fis nonempty if and only if \u0016is a weight of\nV(\u00151)\nV(\u00152).

We understand \b = 0 when\nM(\u0015;\u0016)\u001f=;. Then \b(IC(M(\u0015;\u0016)), if it is nonzero, is a semisimple perverse sheaf\nover a pointM(\u0015;\u0016)\u001fas inx11(iv). We have\nHtop(A\u001f(\u0015;\u0016))\u0018=\b(IC(M(\u0015;\u0016))):\nLet us consider \u001fias inx12(i).

The \fber product\nproperty (12.5) implies \b = \bi\u000e\bi. Thus \b(IC(M(\u0015;\u0016))) = \bi(\bi(IC(M(\u0015;\u0016)))):\nRecall thatM(\u0015;\u0016)\u001fiisMA1(\u00150;\u00160).

The morphisms\np,jare compatible with strata, hence we only get perverse sheaves which are locally\nconstant along strata. By a little more argument one can show that no nonconstant\nlocal systems appear. Hence\n\bi(IC(M(\u0015;\u0016)))\u0018=M\n\u00140M\u0015;\u0016\n\u00140;\u00160\nIC(MA1(\u00140;\u00160))\nfor vector spaces M\u0015;\u0016\n\u00140;\u00160.\nFor\u0016\u0000\u000bi, we have\n\bi(IC(M(\u0015;\u0016\u0000\u000bi)))\u0018=M\n\u00140M\u0015;\u0016\u0000\u000bi\n\u00140;\u00160\u00002\nIC(MA1(\u00140;\u00160\u00002)):\nWe then show that there is a natural isomorphism M\u0015;\u0016\n\u00140;\u00160\u0018=M\u0015;\u0016\u0000\u000bi\n\u00140;\u00160\u00002.
