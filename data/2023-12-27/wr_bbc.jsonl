They also now include six shelters hosting about 61,000 displaced people, mostly from the north.\nThe residents have been told to move immediately to shelters in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah, which is already struggling to cope with several hundred thousand displaced people.\nThe UN human rights office said on Tuesday that it was gravely concerned about the continued bombardment of the Middle Area and its densely populated camps, citing a report from Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) that Deir al-Balah's al-Aqsa hospital had admitted 131 dead following Israeli strikes on Maghazi and Bureij on Sunday.\nIt also warned of a \"deepening and already catastrophic humanitarian situation\", saying that all roads connecting the three camps had been destroyed and that any shelters and hospitals still operating were critically overcrowded and under-resourced.\nA Palestinian woman living in the UK, Alaa, told the BBC that her family had been in Maghazi during Sunday's strikes and were \"having to live with... constant loss, constant fear\".\n\"Pulling people from under the rubble and losing friends, losing family members, being displaced, losing homes,\" she said. \"My four-year-old nephew, he had to evacuate with my family the other day and he was crying, asking for his dad who was killed a month ago.\"\nThe IDF's chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, warned that the fighting with Hamas was taking place in \"a complex area\" and would therefore \"continue for many more months\".\n\"There are no magic solutions or shortcuts in the fundamental dismantling of a terrorist organisation, except persistent and determined fighting, and we are very, very determined,\" he added.\n\"We will also get to the Hamas leadership, whether it takes a week or months.\"\nHe was speaking amid new signs of rising regional tensions with incidents linked to Iran-backed groups in the Red Sea, on the Lebanese border and in Iraq.\nIn his first interview since the start of the war, the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas - a political rival of Hamas who is based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank - said it was unprecedented in Palestinian history.\n\"What's happening in the Palestinian territories is far beyond a disaster and far more than a genocide. The Palestinians have never seen anything like this,\" he told Egypt's ON TV.\n\"Even during the Nakba catastrophe in 1948. What's happening today is far worse,\" he added, referring to the Middle East war that followed Israel's declaration of independence in 1948, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes.\nMr Abbas also warned that the West Bank could implode at any time.\nOn Wednesday, six Palestinians, including a 17-year-old boy, were killed in a drone strike during an Israeli raid on a refugee camp near the western West Bank town of Tulkarm, according to the Palestinian health ministry.\nThe IDF said six \"armed terrorists\" were killed in an air strike after they threw explosive devices at troops carrying out an operation to arrest wanted people."}

They believe Lee took his own life, Yonhap news agency reports.\nPolice said earlier they had received a report that he had left his home after writing a note.\nHe had been under investigation for alleged illegal drug use since October.\nLee's body was taken to Seoul National University Hospital after police located his car near Waryong Park. Reports say his family have refused an autopsy and he will be buried on Friday.\nPolice have begun an investigation to establish the details around his death, including when he arrived at the scene where his body was found, and the time of his death.\nIn Parasite, Lee played the patriarch of the wealthy Park family which is infiltrated by members of a poor family posing as unrelated individuals. The vicious social satire won four Oscars, including best picture.\nYonhap reported that he was suspected of taking drugs such as marijuana and ketamine with a hostess at a bar in Seoul. He had said that though he took what she gave him, he had not known that they were illicit drugs.\nThe hostess had reportedly told the police that he used drugs at her home multiple times - something he denied. He had earlier requested through his lawyer to take a lie detector test.\nHis drug tests had returned negative or inconclusive results, the report added.\nPolice said they regretted that Lee had died in the midst of investigations, but that the inquiry had been \"conducted with [his] consent\", News1 Korea reported. Lee underwent three rounds of questioning, with one session last Saturday lasting 19 hours, according to Yonhap.\nLee's agency, HODU&U Entertainment, said in a statement: \"There is no way to contain the sorrow and despair. We respectfully ask that you refrain from spreading false facts based on speculation... so that [Lee's] final journey will not be unfair.\"\nNews of his death sparked strong reactions online.\n\"I can't imagine how difficult it must have been for him.

According to reports, some businesses were seen taking down posters and advertisements featuring Lee from their stores.\nDrug offences, including those involving usage of marijuana, are considered serious crimes in South Korea. Consumption of marijuana carries prison sentences of up to five years.\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has vowed a crackdown on drugs. This year, the country's authorities expanded its drug crimes department and the national police chief promised \"a total war\" on drug crimes.\nLee is not the only South Korean celebrity who had been investigated for drug use recently. Earlier this month, K-pop star G-Dragon was cleared of drug allegations after weeks of investigations.\nActor Yoo Ah-in is currently standing trial for drug use.\nAdditional reporting by Fan Wang\nIf you're affected by any of the issues in this article you can find details of organisations who can help via the BBC Action Line.\nIn the UK you can call for free, at any time, to hear recorded information on 0800 066 066.

He was its longest-serving MP, winning 14 constituency elections.\nIn a speech to the European Parliament four years ago, Wolfgang Schäuble said that without European unification, east and west, there would have been no German reunification, and he warned that the \"rules-based international order was under pressure\".\nHe withdrew from frontline politics only last year."}

Some have been taken down, while some were still live on Tuesday.\nAmong calls for peaceful protests and political action, there were also explicit calls for violence.\nOne user wrote: \"If you live in Colorado, do what the founding fathers ACTUALLY would want. Grab your rifles and some rope.\"\nIn a statement, Denver Police said it would \"thoroughly investigate any reports of threats or harassment\" but declined to provide further details, citing privacy concerns and the ongoing inquiries.\nDaniel J Jones, Advance Democracy's president, warned that he has observed \"significant violent language and threats being made against the Colorado justices and others perceived to be behind Colorado's Supreme Court ruling\".\n\"The normalisation of this type of violent rhetoric is cause for significant concern and it's appropriate for law enforcement to respond with protective actions,\" he added.\nAlongside threats and warnings of violence and \"civil war\", there were also unevidenced allegations that the extreme rhetoric was a \"trap\" or \"false flag\" designed to goad law-abiding Trump supporters into committing violence.\nOne user wrote \"I know it's all a trap,\" but said they would still \"cheer\" if the justices were victims of targeted violence.\nThe Colorado case was brought by a liberal watchdog group and a collection of anti-Trump Republican and independent voters.\nMr Trump has until 4 January to appeal the Colorado ruling, and legal experts say that it will have a tough time withstanding the scrutiny of the conservative-leaning US Supreme Court.\nMr Trump's Republican challengers have rallied around him on the issue, and Democrats are concerned that the court ruling will further fuel the former president's insistence he is being unfairly targeted by the judicial system.\nTrump himself posted dozens of times on Truth Social over the holiday weekend, criticising the Colorado decision and the many other legal cases against him."}

It should then be chopped into egg-shaped chunks, he said.\n\"Just crush it on the sourdough toast yourself, and always serve with citrus - lemon or lime - and good sea salt, and coriander for freshness,\" he told the Australian Financial Review.\nGranger is survived by his wife and business partner, Natalie Elliott, and his three daughters, Edie, Inès and Bunny."}

I explained that it was an attack of rage, that I hadn't been able to control myself,\" she recalls.\n\"He [Canserbero] collapsed on the sofa asleep and I stabbed him twice in the side. In desperation, I then called my brother Guillermo to help me resolve the situation.\"\nAméstica says that her brother arrived with three officers from Venezuela's intelligence agency, Sebin. \n\"They finished arranging the scene in a way to make it look like a murder-suicide, meaning that they stabbed Carlos a few more times, my brother Guillermo stabbed him four times. The rest, the Sebin officials did,\" she explains.\nAméstica describes how her brother beat Tyrone's face to make it look like he was involved in a fight.\n\"Then we were told how to throw him out of the window to complete the murder-suicide scene,\" she says.\nHer brother Guillermo backs up her account of the evening in a video statement which has also been released by the attorney-general's office.\n\"We lifted the body between the two of us and threw it,\" he says of the moment he and his sister made it look like the rapper had jumped from a window.\nHe alleges that forensic detectives quickly remarked on the fact that the crime scene appeared \"manipulated\".\n\"They told me: 'If you want us to collaborate, it'll cost you $10,000 (£7,850).'\" \n\"Given the circumstances, I agreed,\" he says, describing how the officials from forensic service helped him and his sister tamper with the crime scene.\nVenezuela's Attorney-General Tarek William Saab said that arrest warrants had been issued for several of the Sebin officers who were at the scene, as well as for a forensic pathologist and two investigators with the prosecutor's office involved in the subsequent investigation.\nHe added that six people were already in custody, with more being sought."}

It's a depressingly familiar headline, but legal experts and gender rights activists say the law is still not equipped to deal with such heinous crimes against women.\nWarning: This article contains details some readers may find distressing.\nIt was sometime after 1am on 11 December when more than a dozen people barged into Sasikala's [not her real name] house. \nThe 42-year-old was dragged out, stripped and paraded naked around the village, tied to an electricity pole and beaten for hours.\nA resident of Hosa Vantamuri village in Belagavi district in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, she was being punished because her 24-year-old son had eloped with his 18-year-old girlfriend.\nThe young woman had been betrothed by her family to another man and was to get married the next day. Her furious family wanted to know where the couple were. \nThe police reached the village around 4am after they received a tip-off and rescued Sasikala and took her to hospital. She's reported to be suffering from severe trauma. Her husband later told a visiting state minister that \"my wife and I didn't even know about the relationship\".\nMore than a dozen people have been arrested and a local police officer has been suspended for \"dereliction of duty\".\nThe incident made national headlines and authorities took notice. Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah called it an \"inhuman act\" and promised justice to her.\nThe government also gave her some agricultural land and money, although authorities have acknowledged there could be no compensation for the humiliation she endured.\nKarnataka high court Chief Justice Prasanna Varale and Justice MGS Kamal, who summoned the police and initiated a hearing on their own, said they were \"shocked\" that such an incident could take place in modern India.\nBut the incident in Belagavi is not really rare and several similar incidents have made headlines in India in recent years. \nOne such story that sparked global outrage came from the north-eastern state of Manipur in July. A viral video showed two women being dragged and groped by a mob of men before one of them was allegedly gang-raped. \nThe horrific attack had a political angle - Manipur was gripped by violent ethnic clashes involving the Kuki and Meitei communities.\nBut reports from other states show such incidents are often rooted in caste or familial conflicts, with women's bodies routinely becoming the battleground.\nIn August, a 20-year-old pregnant woman was paraded naked in Rajasthan by her husband and in-laws after she reportedly left him for another man. A 23-year-old tribal woman in Gujarat was punished in a similar manner for eloping with another man in July 2021.\nIn May 2015, five Dalit women were paraded naked and caned by members of a higher caste in Uttar Pradesh after one of their girls eloped with a Dalit boy. In 2014, a 45-year-old woman in Rajasthan was paraded naked on a donkey after being accused of killing her nephew.\nThese are just some cases that made headlines, but there's a general lack of data on such incidents. Some cases get politicised, with opposition parties raising them to embarrass a state government. But activists say women often do not report these crimes because of fear of insensitive questioning by the police and in courts. \n\"Cases involving assault of women are always under-reported because of shame. Families don't come forward because it's a matter of honour and the system does not support the survivors or give them a safe space to report these crimes,\" says lawyer and rights activist Sukriti Chauhan.\nIn the National Crime Records Bureau database, disrobing is recorded under a broad description called \"assault with intent to outrage [a woman's] modesty\", which clubs the crime with cases of street harassment, sexual gestures, voyeurism and stalking. Last year, 83,344 such cases were recorded with 85,300 affected women. \nSuch cases are dealt with under article 354 of the Indian Penal Code and are punishable by a mere three to seven years in jail - which, Ms Chauhan says, is \"grossly inadequate\".\n\"It's a mockery of justice. Law works only when it deters. Right now this law is not a deterrent and that undermines women. It needs to be amended to enhance the punishment,\" she says.\nIn the Karnataka high court, the justices also noted that the assault in Belagavi was watched by \"a crowd of 50-60 villagers\", adding that \"only one man tried to intervene and he was also beaten up\".\nHighlighting the need for \"collective responsibility\" to stop such atrocities, the judges cited a case from the 1830s - when India was governed by the British - pointing out that an entire village was made to pay for a crime.\n\"All village people should be made responsible... Somebody could have tried to stop that,\" they said. \nChief Justice Varale also invoked Draupadi from the epic Mahabharat, who's saved by Hindu god Krishna when she's being disrobed, to advise women \"to pick up arms as no god will come to protect you\".\nThat advice, Ms Chauhan believes, is not practical. \n\"We are not Draupadis and there are no weapons to be picked up. Also, the onus cannot be on women. The law has to talk to the wrongdoer, but it's still telling women that they have to find a way to stay safe,\" she says. \n\"The message we need to get across is stop fighting your ethnic, caste and family battles on our bodies, they are not your battlefield,\" she adds.\nMaumil Mehraj, a research analyst who works with young people on gender equity, says the reason a woman's body is treated as a battlefield is because it's connected to her - and by extension her family, caste and community's - honour. \n\"It's always why women disproportionately have to bear the brunt during conflicts,\" she says. \nSuch incidents, she says, also have an element of voyeurism because they are seen, photographed and filmed.\nIn Belagavi, she says, one of those arrested is a minor, indicating that such crimes have been normalised to such an extent that even the next generation has grown up with entrenched gender ideas. \n\"So will a law be enough to deal with such cases? I think the only solution is bringing up better boys. It's necessary to teach them that connecting a woman's body to her honour is problematic,\" she says. \n\"It's a Herculean task, but has to start early. Otherwise this vicious violence against women will continue.\"\nBBC News India is now on YouTube. Click here to subscribe and watch our documentaries, explainers and features."}

The turmoil and bag, in which he had crammed his passport, two pairs of jeans, five shirts and a car key, is depicted in his painting Man With a Heavy Heart.\nHe first created the work as a mural in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, which he reached after a harrowing journey in June.\nHaving now found temporary refuge in Kenya, he has recreated it on canvas - a striking image of a man with a hand over his heart, surrounded by large circular red dots resembling gunshot wounds.\nA moon shines behind his head and lying on the ground is the backpack - symbolising all that Sudanese people have lost in the eight-month conflict. He had initially packed his car key thinking he would be back home soon.\n\"I paint my pain,\" he tells me in his home-cum-studio in Kenya's capital, Nairobi.\nAs an artist, he says his mission is to turn his personal experience into a collective visual narrative, offering a powerful glimpse into the \"many people lost\" in Sudan and the heavy toil of a \"useless war\".\nThe conflict began in April when two generals in the ruling junta fell out - pitting the army against the formidable paramilitary group known as the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The fighting has since forced around seven million people from their homes, the UN says.\nYousif heard the first signs of war while working late towards the end of Ramadan in his studio near the presidential palace in Sudan's capital.\nIn the early hours of 15 April, he noticed troops massing nearby. Sensing something was about to happen, he decided to drive back to his family's home in the north of Khartoum - reaching there just before dawn after which the fighting started.\n\"Chaotic days\" followed, he says, as there was no water, electricity and little food - and he struggled to care for his elderly aunt and uncle and other relatives.\nEvery night he heard the sounds of planes and gunfire and could see large plumes of smoke descending over the city - prompting him to take the decision to leave.\nHe hoped it was a temporary move - managing to get bus tickets for all the family to head to their ancestral home in the city of Rufa'ah - around 150km (93 miles) south-east of Khartoum.\nAs the situation deteriorated and with his relatives too frail to travel further, Yousif realised that as a well-established artist he could do more to support them if he headed to Nairobi. So he set off with his backpack on public transport to Metemma, a town on the border with Ethiopia where thousands of people were heading.\nA month later he managed to get a flight from Addis Ababa to Nairobi where he has found a community of other Sudanese artists who had also fled the once-thriving art scene in Khartoum.\nAccording to Khartoum art curator Rahiem Shadad, around 35 of these artists are now in the Kenyan capital, including other big names like Bakri Moaz, Yasir Algari and Hani Khalil Jawdat. Others have settled in Cairo.\nMr Shadad, who owns Khartoum's Downtown Gallery, representing many esteemed contemporary artists, tells the BBC his art space now lies in ruins.\nA vast amount of artwork, including at least 165 framed paintings and 300 other pieces belonging to 60 artists, has also been lost, he says.\nIn recent months, the curator, who is also in Nairobi, has spearheaded numerous exhibitions of Sudanese art in the city. \nHe recently set up The Rest, a space for those in exile to live and work, with support from Nairobi's GoDown Arts Centre. \nDespite this warm welcome by Kenya's art community, life is difficult for the Sudanese artists because of issues around asylum, lack of documents and their lack of substantial incomes.\n\"Some of these artists came with just $100 [£80] in their pockets,\" Mr Shadad says.\nMany of them are also deeply traumatised by their experience and losing their entire catalogue.\n\"Emotionally and spiritually, I am not OK,\" artist Tibian Bahari tells me about not being able to return to Sudan where her father and sister still live.\nHer aim is to keep Sudan - a \"sacred and magical land\" - alive through her work, which currently centres around depicting the country's topography.\nThis determination comes down to her clothing.\n\"I always wear my jalabiya every morning,\" she says, referring to the ankle-length, loose-fitting robe with wide long sleeves worn by both men and women in Sudan. \nShe feels a deep sense of \"responsibility\" to share \"truthfully\" her journey and map out the art of displacement and especially keep a space for Sudan's women artists. \nMany artists were part of the civilian protest movement that prompted the overthrow of Sudan's long-time leader Omar al-Bashir in 2019. Afterwards, the army initially entered into a power-sharing arrangement with civilian groups, before seizing power and the decent into war.\nThese artists feel their dreams have been crushed by the conflict - and that the world has forgotten them in the wake of the conflict in Gaza.\nIn the last week, fighting has escalated. Yousif's family has been under attack by the RSF in Rufa'ah.\nBefore the phone lines went down, he heard that his family, including his aunt, uncle and some of his siblings, had been forced out of their home by the RSF. They had managed to seek shelter at his grandmother's house in city centre.\n\"For the second time, my family has lost our home, first in Khartoum and now in Rufa'ah,\" he says, describing a city under siege.\n\"Nobody can go out,\" he says, adding that they are virtually prisoners unable to move around or flee.\nLike his painting, Yousif feels his heart continues to bleed."}

A little mini army and they were engaged in some sort of argument about land and money.\"\nThe abbey was about to start a big building programme and needed cash: \"this man is not someone spending all of his time with his prayer book. He is a man of business.\"\nMalmesbury Abbey as it is today is partly a product of this moment in history - the top bit was rebuilt at this point, while the bottom was already in place.\nThe building there now is a small, but grand, a reminder of the whole abbey, as this section stayed as a church after the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1500s.\nThen in the 1320s, the abbey became embroiled in a feud involving £10,000, which, by today's standards, would have been millions.\nThe monasteries at the time had political allegiances and at Malmesbury they supported a local noble family called the Despensers. \nThe family left a large amount of cash with the abbey for safekeeping. \nHowever, when the tide turned against them, the head of the family was executed and the monastery decided to keep quiet about the money they had stored. \nThey even had a royal visit while they had the cash stashed there, likely in their living area, the only part of which remains in the basement of Abbey House in the town.\n\"The monks must have been terrified that they had this dark secret,\" Mr McAleavy said.\n\"They kept quiet about it, and then ten years later it came to light. Somebody obviously ratted on them.\" \nAs the right-hand man of the Abbot at the time, John was hauled in front of royalty once again and placed in custody.\nIn the end though, the monks of Malmesbury were pardoned: \"Extraordinarily, the King took the 10,000 and let him off. Basically, they all got away with it.\"\nMr McAleavy explained that despite being elected as the Abbey's Abbot in 1340,  John of Tintern was up to much worse.\n\"He operated as a gangster and a gangster who was prepared to kill or have his enemies killed.\" \nTo add to his unseemly behaviour as a monk, he was also living openly with a woman - Margaret of Lea, in a village next to Malmesbury.\nHe was accused of being the person to burn down the manor house her and her husband had been living in and abducting her.\nIt appeared to be a well-known story in the town, as local people came forward to report his crimes when the Justices travelled to Malmesbury from London.\nHowever, it was not only arson and abduction he was accused of - John of Tintern had ordered four murders. \nThose killed were from the local gentry, some were tenants of abbey land and \"it seems that John wanted to get rid of them, so that he could give the land, give tenancies to his cronies.\"\nTo make everything more corrupt, his ally was the Sheriff of Wiltshire himself, Gilbert of Berwick, who was supposed to be in charge of the county's law and order.\nWhen the murders took place though, John was absent, getting a man from nearby Badminton to do the dirty work of beating and killing.\nAn arrest warrant was issued and they - Margaret included - went on the run.\nMr McAleavy explained that is not quite clear what happened, but they were found and put on trial in London.\nIt seems like this should have been the end of John of Tintern's escapades.\n\"He literally got away with murder,\" Mr McAleavy said.\n\"The court accepted his guilt. They pardoned him in return for a massive fine so, basically he was fined for committing murder.\"\nIt was a fine of £500, the equivalent hundreds of thousands today. \nMr McAleavy believes that money played a big part in all of this, with the Abbey undergoing lots of building work at the time and hiring one of the top architects.\nThere is evidence in the Vatican archives that John of Tintern did feel some guilt though.\nHe applied to the Pope for something called an \"indulgence\".\nMr McAleavy explained this meant \"approval from the Pope that at the moment of his death all his sins would be forgiven.\n\"That was just a standard transaction at the time in return for money.\n \"I think maybe he had something of a guilty conscience.\"\nIn 1349, John of Tintern died. It is not certain how, but the Black Death was ripping through the country.\nIt was a long research journey for Tony McAleavy who said: \"You have to pinch yourself when you look at these documents. \n\"How can this possibly be true? How can this man of religion have behaved so incredibly badly?\"\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram. Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk "}

Carmela's international love letter did not make it to its destination in Morocco. \nInstead, it ended up hidden deep in the Spanish archives, in an unexpected stash of hundreds of amorous messages between Spanish women and Moroccan men. \nSeized between the 1930s and the 1950s, they chronicle forbidden intimate relationships. \nFor decades, colonial authorities of the Spanish protectorate in Morocco systematically seized this mail.\nThe boxes are full of words of passion: \"I am crazy for you… I am like a goat for you,\" writes one woman from Valencia. \nSome contain photographs. Inserted in letter after letter, there are dozens of portraits of women with immaculate hairdos posing to remind their distant lovers what they looked like. One sent a picture of herself riding a bicycle, a carefree snapshot of everyday life.\nAll were neatly filed away in envelopes by conscientious bureaucrats, and then forgotten amid routine administrative documents. \nThey accumulated dust until they were found and published by academics Josep LluísMateo Dieste and Nieves Muriel García.\nEach letter contains a tantalising glimpse into an entire relationship, but each one also tells us about the repression that these relationships faced. \nSpanish officials tried everything they could to make these relationships impossible. \nAs one directive stated in 1937: \"As a general rule, marriages between Moroccan soldiers with Spanish women must be prevented.\"\nSince 1912, Spain had claimed sovereignty over part of Morocco as a protectorate, dividing the country into two zones, along with France. \nFighters form the Berber community resisted this, most notoriously in the long and bloody Rif War between 1921 and 1926, which saw the Spanish army decimated by forces led by Abdelkrim al-Khattabi. \nTo overcome this challenge, the Spanish government increased the number of its troops in Morocco and recruited thousands of Moroccans to serve in its army. \nBy the 1930s a long strip along the north of the country, from the Atlantic coast in Asilah almost up to the border with Algeria in the east, was effectively administered by Spain with its capital in Tetouan. \nIt was from the military bases in this territory that in 1936, Gen Francisco Franco launched a coup against the Republican government, starting the Spanish Civil War. \nAs the war raged on, suddenly thousands of Moroccan men conscripted into the Spanish military were sent across the sea to Spain to fight alongside Franco's forces. \nBeyond the military, students, traders and other workers also joined them and ended up living around the country, in cities as well as more remote rural locations. \nAfter all, unlike many European colonial possessions, this one lay just a stone's throw away from Spain itself - at its narrowest in the Strait of Gibraltar, the Moroccan coast is only 14km (8.5 miles) away from the southern tip of the Iberian peninsula. \nWherever they went, Moroccan men met Spanish women. \nIn Salamanca, a woman named Concha met Nasar, a Moroccan soldier stationed nearby. \nMadly in love, she wrote to his superiors for permission to marry him in 1938. But for Spanish colonial authorities, such contact absolutely had to be banned. \nThey expressed disgust at Concha, who they disparaged as old, \"ugly, fat like a hippo and with a slight limp\".  \nThey suspected that Nasar had only shown interest because Concha happened to own a house, which is what awakened his \"volcanic love\".\nOfficial orders were to place \"as many difficulties as possible\" to prevent these relationships \"without openly banning them\", as one order put it in 1937. \nIndeed, as the Franco regime relied on the loyalty of Moroccan soldiers, they did not make such relationships explicitly illegal. Instead, they developed a whole series of means to make them impossible in practice. \nFor example, if a woman was found to be writing to a Moroccan man, they would ban her from entering Morocco. \nOften, they would also ban the Moroccan man from entering Spain, rendering their relationship impossible. \nIn 1948, a letter was intercepted between Carmen from Zaragoza to her lover Abdeselam in Morocco. The authorities in Tetouan immediately banned both from crossing to the opposite side. \nIn the letter, Carmen gave news of their daughter, who would now grow up without ever seeing her father. The officials did not take the child into consideration.\nWhy did they regard these relationships with such contempt? \nPart of the answer lies in the dictatorship's reactionary ideology. \nFranco's government was aggressively misogynistic, rigidly controlling the mobility of women and restricting their access to employment. \nIt also saw itself as a defender of Catholicism, and for religious reasons, women who married Muslim men were seen as \"lost to the faith\". \nBut the biggest single reason was what officials called \"prestigio de raza\", \"the prestige of the race\". \nFor colonial rule to continue, Spain had to be seen as superior to Morocco. \nAs the government understood marriage to be the subordination of a woman by a man, any marriage across the colonial divide would make a Spanish woman subservient to a Moroccan man. \nIf this came to be known, it would undermine the very basis of colonial domination. \nBy contrast, relationships between Spanish men and Moroccan women, which were plentiful in the protectorate, did not attract such extensive scrutiny and censorship as they reproduced the larger power structure of society on an intimate scale without threatening it.\nThis was not specific to Spain: the fear of European women entering into relationships with colonised men was common across all European colonial administrations. \nIn the neighbouring French zone, officials expressed similar disapproval for the political consequences of these relationships. \nThe Dutch in the East Indies and the British in India saw relationships between European women and colonised men as much more threatening than the reverse, and policed them accordingly. \nWhile the range of measures to discourage these relationships went from disapproval to outright bans, the underlying rule was the same: such relationships were a threat. \nThese letters, however, reveal that beneath the surface of colonial society, encounters were common and led to a whole range of relationships: friendships, courtships, sexual encounters and marriages. \nOpening them is thrilling - a window into lives that official documents rarely tell us about. But it is also unsettling - most letters never made it to their destination. It feels like an invasion of privacy, as these people never chose to be included in this archive.\nWhen Morocco became independent in 1956, the protectorate government in Tetouan shut down and its archives were mostly forgotten. \nThey ended up mostly near Madrid, in the central archives of the administration in the university town of Alcalá de Henares where - like most of Spain's colonial history in Africa - they were forgotten. \nBut despite the recent publication of some of these letters, their stories remain poorly known, and this long-forgotten archive has not yet revealed all of its secrets. \nDr Arthur Asseraf is a historian of modern France, North Africa and the Mediterranean.\nPhoto illustrations by Matt Thomas; source photographs from Getty Images.\nYou may also be interested in:"}

Later in the year, she co-captained India to their first-ever Asian Games gold medal in cricket alongside Smriti Mandhana.\nWider recognition followed as Wisden named her one of its five cricketers of the year, a first for an Indian woman; BBC's 100 influential women of the year line-up featured her, as did TIME magazine on its 100 Next list.\nThe burgeoning bouquet of accolades is a reflection of Kaur's peak influence in her field. It also coincides with a time the women's game continues to break new ground in cricket-obsessed India and beyond.\n\"She's an unbelievably talented cricketer and has showcased that for an extended period of time,\" Australia captain Alyssa Healy said. The two sides recently met for a test match in the financial city of Mumbai, which India won by eight wickets.\n\"But what she has done in leading this Indian side, and almost this new generation of Indian women cricket into the modern game, has been really amazing to watch.\"\nOne of the small-town success stories of Indian cricket, Kaur hails from Moga, long dubbed the \"drug capital\" of Punjab. The oldest of three siblings, she was born into a Sikh family of meagre economic means and first played cricket with a hockey stick, with boys at a ground in her neighbourhood.\nIt was only after a teenaged Kaur first met her mentor, Kamaldheesh Singh Sodhi - a regular visitor at the ground - between 2006 and 2007, that her life was set on the cricketing track in earnest.\n\"She was a natural athlete whose potential found direction under my father,\" Sodhi's son, Yadwinder, also Kaur's first coach, told the BBC. \"Her fearless temper and genuine love for cricket has underpinned her appetite for getting better at the game, learning to hit those big sixes…and look how far it has brought her.\"\nA pivotal force in the surging popularity of women's cricket in India, Kaur, alongside her vice-captain Mandhana, continues to elevate her status as a trailblazer in the country's women's sports.\n\"Every era has two or three such figures, and Harman has been in the driver's seat for a few years now, especially since getting the captaincy in T20s [in 2016],\" said former India captain Anjum Chopra.\n\"Stepping into full-time leadership across formats after the retirement of the legendary Mithali Raj last year has significantly elevated her standing.\"\nWith over 6,500 runs in 290 international appearances, Kaur has led India to uncharted territories both at home and abroad.\nIn 2020, she guided them to their first T20 World Cup final, secured their inaugural ODI series win in England in almost 23 years during last summer's multi-format tour, and won silver at the Commonwealth Games' inaugural women's cricket competition just weeks before.\n\"The most important thing that I remember about working with Harman was the way she was always looking to do things for the team,\" former India head coach WV Raman said. \"Her personal form wasn't the best, and the harder she tried, the worse it got. But she was calm, receptive and quick to implement any feedback about her batting for the sake of the team.\"\nKaur's limited-overs prowess remains the cornerstone of her cricketing clout. But in December, she made good on a rare Test-playing opportunity, too.\nOn Test captaincy debut, she deployed refreshingly attacking ploys from the start and scored 49 and 44 not-out in India's record 347-run victory against England in Navi Mumbai, the highest margin in women's cricket ever. Over the weekend, she made history as the first captain to lead India Women to a Test victory against Australia in Mumbai.\nAhead of the England Test, India's first women's Test on home soil in nearly a decade and Kaur's fifth overall in the longest format, she made her view on personal milestones clear.\n\"I want this team to grow in a way that everyone says that this is the best team,\" she said. \"For me winning a World Cup is a dream … I don't count my personal achievements to any level because I'm playing a team sport. If the team is doing well I'm happy.\n\"At the same time, when you're not feeling great, you see people telling you, 'You've done this and that,' to make you feel good.\"\nOne of the most belligerent batters in modern cricket, paradox underlines Kaur's playing style as it does her personality. Poise and power define her batting, affable reticence her private demeanour, and the occasional inability to read the room her chequered time at office.\nIssues concerning on-field conduct have dotted her career. In June, the latest incident, where Kaur smashed her stumps and criticised umpires during an ODI against hosts Bangladesh, resulted in a two-match ban imposed by the International Cricket Council (ICC).\n\"You can be angry if you don't feel a decision was right, but you can't have an outburst in front of the world,\" Chopra said. \"That said, as an athlete, if you trade the natural instincts that make you human and genuine for a picture-perfect, plastic personality, you cease to be relatable.\"\nBoth Chopra and Raman believe the next three years or so might be Kaur's best, and most consistent, yet.\n\"That's because she's gradually understanding herself better and is also aware of her cricket a lot more,\" Raman said. \"Plus, she knows that she's got a bunch of cricketers who relate to the fact that she's all for the development of the team and the individuals.\"\nThe ingredients are in place for Kaur to leave an unrivalled legacy. If the stars align, it could be marked by India's first senior women's World Cup win, in the T20 edition in Bangladesh next year, at home in the ODI edition in 2025, or both.\nBBC News India is now on YouTube.

The turmoil and bag, in which he had crammed his passport, two pairs of jeans, five shirts and a car key, is depicted in his painting Man With a Heavy Heart.\nHe first created the work as a mural in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, which he reached after a harrowing journey in June.\nHaving now found temporary refuge in Kenya, he has recreated it on canvas - a striking image of a man with a hand over his heart, surrounded by large circular red dots resembling gunshot wounds.\nA moon shines behind his head and lying on the ground is the backpack - symbolising all that Sudanese people have lost in the eight-month conflict. He had initially packed his car key thinking he would be back home soon.\n\"I paint my pain,\" he tells me in his home-cum-studio in Kenya's capital, Nairobi.\nAs an artist, he says his mission is to turn his personal experience into a collective visual narrative, offering a powerful glimpse into the \"many people lost\" in Sudan and the heavy toil of a \"useless war\".\nThe conflict began in April when two generals in the ruling junta fell out - pitting the army against the formidable paramilitary group known as the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The fighting has since forced around seven million people from their homes, the UN says.\nYousif heard the first signs of war while working late towards the end of Ramadan in his studio near the presidential palace in Sudan's capital.\nIn the early hours of 15 April, he noticed troops massing nearby. Sensing something was about to happen, he decided to drive back to his family's home in the north of Khartoum - reaching there just before dawn after which the fighting started.\n\"Chaotic days\" followed, he says, as there was no water, electricity and little food - and he struggled to care for his elderly aunt and uncle and other relatives.\nEvery night he heard the sounds of planes and gunfire and could see large plumes of smoke descending over the city - prompting him to take the decision to leave.\nHe hoped it was a temporary move - managing to get bus tickets for all the family to head to their ancestral home in the city of Rufa'ah - around 150km (93 miles) south-east of Khartoum.\nAs the situation deteriorated and with his relatives too frail to travel further, Yousif realised that as a well-established artist he could do more to support them if he headed to Nairobi. So he set off with his backpack on public transport to Metemma, a town on the border with Ethiopia where thousands of people were heading.\nA month later he managed to get a flight from Addis Ababa to Nairobi where he has found a community of other Sudanese artists who had also fled the once-thriving art scene in Khartoum.\nAccording to Khartoum art curator Rahiem Shadad, around 35 of these artists are now in the Kenyan capital, including other big names like Bakri Moaz, Yasir Algari and Hani Khalil Jawdat. Others have settled in Cairo.\nMr Shadad, who owns Khartoum's Downtown Gallery, representing many esteemed contemporary artists, tells the BBC his art space now lies in ruins.\nA vast amount of artwork, including at least 165 framed paintings and 300 other pieces belonging to 60 artists, has also been lost, he says.\nIn recent months, the curator, who is also in Nairobi, has spearheaded numerous exhibitions of Sudanese art in the city. \nHe recently set up The Rest, a space for those in exile to live and work, with support from Nairobi's GoDown Arts Centre. \nDespite this warm welcome by Kenya's art community, life is difficult for the Sudanese artists because of issues around asylum, lack of documents and their lack of substantial incomes.\n\"Some of these artists came with just $100 [£80] in their pockets,\" Mr Shadad says.\nMany of them are also deeply traumatised by their experience and losing their entire catalogue.\n\"Emotionally and spiritually, I am not OK,\" artist Tibian Bahari tells me about not being able to return to Sudan where her father and sister still live.\nHer aim is to keep Sudan - a \"sacred and magical land\" - alive through her work, which currently centres around depicting the country's topography.\nThis determination comes down to her clothing.\n\"I always wear my jalabiya every morning,\" she says, referring to the ankle-length, loose-fitting robe with wide long sleeves worn by both men and women in Sudan. \nShe feels a deep sense of \"responsibility\" to share \"truthfully\" her journey and map out the art of displacement and especially keep a space for Sudan's women artists. \nMany artists were part of the civilian protest movement that prompted the overthrow of Sudan's long-time leader Omar al-Bashir in 2019. Afterwards, the army initially entered into a power-sharing arrangement with civilian groups, before seizing power and the decent into war.\nThese artists feel their dreams have been crushed by the conflict - and that the world has forgotten them in the wake of the conflict in Gaza.\nIn the last week, fighting has escalated. Yousif's family has been under attack by the RSF in Rufa'ah.\nBefore the phone lines went down, he heard that his family, including his aunt, uncle and some of his siblings, had been forced out of their home by the RSF. They had managed to seek shelter at his grandmother's house in city centre.\n\"For the second time, my family has lost our home, first in Khartoum and now in Rufa'ah,\" he says, describing a city under siege.\n\"Nobody can go out,\" he says, adding that they are virtually prisoners unable to move around or flee.\nLike his painting, Yousif feels his heart continues to bleed."}

And she did get there,\" her mother Gillian says, proudly.\nGrowing up in Wickford in Essex, Grace was a livewire who made friends wherever she went.\n\"She was my best friend, we would always disappear to the pub for a quick drink and we would go away on holiday together,\" Gillian says.\nFive years ago, after graduating from the University of Lincoln, Grace set out on a year-long solo backpacking adventure across the world.\nAfter a six-week tour of Peru, she arrived in New Zealand. Less than a fortnight later, on the eve of her 22nd birthday, she was strangled to death by a man she met on a dating app.\nGrace was constantly in touch with her family but had not responded to their birthday messages on 2 December, so they reported her missing to the police.\nGillian was recovering from surgery for breast cancer and not able to join the search. Her husband, Grace's father David, flew out to New Zealand but a week later, their daughter's body was found in bushland on the outskirts of Auckland.\nDuring a three-week trial, the family had to sit through her killer's attempts to pass the murder off as \"rough sex\" gone wrong and his claims that Grace asked to be strangled.\n\"I felt like Grace was on trial and she couldn't defend herself. As a parent, I didn't want to listen to that. It was horrendous.\n\"You can't ask for your own death. It is ludicrous this can be used as a defence.\"\nA jury unanimously convicted him of murder and he was sentenced to life in prison.\nThe family decided never to mention his name again. \"We never say it. It's a waste of energy. I don't care about him, I don't think about him,\" Gillian says.\nGillian has since campaigned against the rough sex defence, with the charity We Can't Consent To This, and has helped to change the law in England and Wales.\nTwo years after Grace's murder, Gillian's husband David died from cancer, which left her in a \"really dark place\".\nGillian credits her family and friends, long walks and \"lots of counselling\" for her still being here today.\n\"I did contemplate suicide. That is a horrid place to be. But I couldn't bring any more sadness to the family. Grace had such a bright future and it was taken away from her and us.\n\"I will never see Grace in a wedding dress or see her grandchildren. This is a life sentence I've got. This is me until the day I die. But there is a light and I found it. You have to find that inner strength.\"\nDavid died during Covid and they could not be together as a family but Gillian later threw a memorial party and it became a turning point.\n\"A friend dragged me up to dance. I wasn't sure if it was the right thing to do but I laughed and I looked around the room and everyone was smiling.\n\"My toes stay in the darkness but the rest of me is facing the sun a bit. Sometimes it goes up to my waist and I do go into that black hole but I have people behind me who support me.\"\nChristmas is a very difficult time for Gillian, so last year she decided to spend it climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, which was \"incredibly emotional\".\n\"I went from not wanting to leave the house to climbing a mountain on the other side of the world.\n\"I had to train and be focused. I didn't realise the power it was giving me and how much it was helping me.\n\"Everything was aching but I knew Grace and David would be pushing me up there. They wanted to still be here, they didn't want to go, so I thought 'right get up there'.\"\nGillian left a stone for Grace and David at the top, in tribute to them.\n\"Whenever I go somewhere special, I put the stones there, so they are travelling. If someone picks a stone up and moves it, they go somewhere else.\"\nHer efforts raised £33,000 for the White Ribbon charity, which aims to end male violence against women. Gillian received a thank you card from the charity, saying the money had been used to fund education programmes in 65 schools in the Hull area.\n\"I just want to raise awareness and get that message out there about violence against women so that no other family has to live this life I live,\" Gillian says.\nFour years ago, with her niece Hannah, Gillian started the charity initiative Love Grace. They collect donated handbags and fill them with toiletries for domestic abuse victims.\nSo far, they have filled 15,600 bags for women in the UK and across the world and they received an award from the prime minister.\nGrace loved handbags, Gillian says, and each bag has a tag on it with her handwriting.\n\"It's a simple idea but it has really taken off,\" Gillian says. \"We were just doing it for our grief so that Grace would never just be a number.\n\"They get this bag, they are not expecting it and they have gone through hell. We get hundreds of letters from people who have received the bags, it's heartbreaking.\"\nNext year, Gillian is applying for Love Grace to become an official charity and she will be training for a trek to Everest basecamp in September, with a plan to place two more stones there.\nOne day she hopes to travel to New Zealand, a country which Gillian says has really taken Grace to their hearts.\n\"I still get loads of messages of support from there. It wasn't New Zealand or travelling that killed Grace, or anything she did. It was that individual.\"\nFive years on from her daughter's death, living without Grace has not got any easier. But Gillian is still trying hard to face the sun.\n\"I should never have buried my child and certainly she should never have died the way she did. People keep saying I'm really strong but I don't think so, I'm just a mum.\"\nShe adds: \"I am more resilient than I ever thought I was. I do think David and Grace would be proud. I think Grace would laugh and say these treks are a mid-life crisis.\n\"I will never get over it but I just know I've got to make the world a better place. I want to change things so that no other family has to go through what we go through. That has got to be a good thing.\"\nIf you, or someone you know, is feeling emotionally distressed, BBC Action Line has put together a list of organisations which can help.\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

He was not known to have many friends or associates in the province, apart from the journalist, Mary Holland.\nWhere Dr Mowlam was seen as too close to nationalism, Lord Mandelson was expected to appear more neutral.\nAs a staunch Blairite, he was considered to \"be a strong supporter of the Good Friday Agreement\", though not being one of its architects, he would possibly \"be willing to look at it in a more flexible way\".\nBy early 2000 the Irish government was dissatisfied with the extent of Lord Mandelson's neutrality and flexibility. In particular, they were concerned that his equivocation on the name of the new police service and his initial refusal to commit to an entirely neutral new badge for the force constituted unacceptable deviations from Patten's recommendations.\nLord Mandelson resigned as secretary of state in January 2001, two months after the enactment of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act which established the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), replacing the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC).\nOne of the last high-profile security incidents policed by the RUC before its replacement in November 2001 was the loyalist protest at Holy Cross girls' primary school in Ardoyne, north Belfast.\nThe archives contain detailed daily reports of the situation which began on 19 June, noting \"conflicting reports about the cause\".\nLoyalists complained that a woman from their community had been prevented from accessing shops by some men, while nationalists claimed a Catholic man who had been collecting his child from school was assaulted by loyalists who were erecting paramilitary flags in the area.\nThe parish priest of Ardoyne, Fr Aidan Troy, identified demographic change as another contributory factor - citing a recent increase in the Catholic population of the area.\nThe role of loyalist paramilitaries was also significant.\nLoyalists expelled from the Shankill Road during the previous year's feud had re-settled in the Glenbryn estate in Ardoyne and were \"intent on stirring things up\".\nFr Troy did not see the dispute as entirely one-sided and had personal experience of the intimidation complained of by loyalists living in the area.\nThe papers said: \"He himself had been stoned by young children while out jogging because they mistook his t-shirt for a Glasgow Rangers jersey.\"\nEarly on the morning of 3 September 2001, as the school was reopening for the new school year, Fr Troy sought conciliatory talks with the local Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) MLA Billy Hutchinson.\nFr Troy was met with Mr Hutchinson's refusal to talk \"to scum like you\".\nThe priest attributed the vehemence of Mr Hutchinson's language to Fr Troy's role \"[a]s a priest\" but declined to specify other comments uttered to him in the \"tongue-lashing\" he received from Mr Hutchinson.\n\"What he called me was unrepeatable,\" said Fr Troy.\nThe protests were eventually suspended in November 2001 following intervention by the Northern Ireland Executive with a cross-community support package providing additional resources for schools, traffic-calming, community transport, policing and a community forum.\nBut a brief recurrence of violence when the school re-opened in January 2002 after the Christmas holidays showed how volatile the situation remained.\nThe school principal Anne Tanney \"bemoaned the fact that the name Holy Cross had become synonymous with bigotry and sectarian hatred, appearing alongside Drumcree in articles as a by-word for all that was wrong in their society\".\nProfessor Marie Coleman is Professor of Twentieth Century Irish History at Queen's University Belfast"}

A little mini army and they were engaged in some sort of argument about land and money.\"\nThe abbey was about to start a big building programme and needed cash: \"this man is not someone spending all of his time with his prayer book. He is a man of business.\"\nMalmesbury Abbey as it is today is partly a product of this moment in history - the top bit was rebuilt at this point, while the bottom was already in place.\nThe building there now is a small, but grand, a reminder of the whole abbey, as this section stayed as a church after the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1500s.\nThen in the 1320s, the abbey became embroiled in a feud involving £10,000, which, by today's standards, would have been millions.\nThe monasteries at the time had political allegiances and at Malmesbury they supported a local noble family called the Despensers. \nThe family left a large amount of cash with the abbey for safekeeping. \nHowever, when the tide turned against them, the head of the family was executed and the monastery decided to keep quiet about the money they had stored. \nThey even had a royal visit while they had the cash stashed there, likely in their living area, the only part of which remains in the basement of Abbey House in the town.\n\"The monks must have been terrified that they had this dark secret,\" Mr McAleavy said.\n\"They kept quiet about it, and then ten years later it came to light. Somebody obviously ratted on them.\" \nAs the right-hand man of the Abbot at the time, John was hauled in front of royalty once again and placed in custody.\nIn the end though, the monks of Malmesbury were pardoned: \"Extraordinarily, the King took the 10,000 and let him off. Basically, they all got away with it.\"\nMr McAleavy explained that despite being elected as the Abbey's Abbot in 1340,  John of Tintern was up to much worse.\n\"He operated as a gangster and a gangster who was prepared to kill or have his enemies killed.\" \nTo add to his unseemly behaviour as a monk, he was also living openly with a woman - Margaret of Lea, in a village next to Malmesbury.\nHe was accused of being the person to burn down the manor house her and her husband had been living in and abducting her.\nIt appeared to be a well-known story in the town, as local people came forward to report his crimes when the Justices travelled to Malmesbury from London.\nHowever, it was not only arson and abduction he was accused of - John of Tintern had ordered four murders. \nThose killed were from the local gentry, some were tenants of abbey land and \"it seems that John wanted to get rid of them, so that he could give the land, give tenancies to his cronies.\"\nTo make everything more corrupt, his ally was the Sheriff of Wiltshire himself, Gilbert of Berwick, who was supposed to be in charge of the county's law and order.\nWhen the murders took place though, John was absent, getting a man from nearby Badminton to do the dirty work of beating and killing.\nAn arrest warrant was issued and they - Margaret included - went on the run.\nMr McAleavy explained that is not quite clear what happened, but they were found and put on trial in London.\nIt seems like this should have been the end of John of Tintern's escapades.\n\"He literally got away with murder,\" Mr McAleavy said.\n\"The court accepted his guilt. They pardoned him in return for a massive fine so, basically he was fined for committing murder.\"\nIt was a fine of £500, the equivalent hundreds of thousands today. \nMr McAleavy believes that money played a big part in all of this, with the Abbey undergoing lots of building work at the time and hiring one of the top architects.\nThere is evidence in the Vatican archives that John of Tintern did feel some guilt though.\nHe applied to the Pope for something called an \"indulgence\".\nMr McAleavy explained this meant \"approval from the Pope that at the moment of his death all his sins would be forgiven.\n\"That was just a standard transaction at the time in return for money.\n \"I think maybe he had something of a guilty conscience.\"\nIn 1349, John of Tintern died. It is not certain how, but the Black Death was ripping through the country.\nIt was a long research journey for Tony McAleavy who said: \"You have to pinch yourself when you look at these documents. \n\"How can this possibly be true? How can this man of religion have behaved so incredibly badly?\"\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram. Send your story ideas to: bristol@bbc.co.uk "}

Every piece. But when, on this narrow piece, enemy shells start to dig this place together with stones, with earth, with our soldiers, the lives of our soldiers are more important to us,\" he said.\nGen Zaluzhnyi noted that Mariinka had been held for almost two years, but it was destroyed \"street by street, house by house.\"\n\"Mariinka is no more,\" he added.\nThe town has been used by Ukraine as a defensive barrier since 2014, when Russia-backed fighters seized large swathes of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions.\nPresident Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nIn recent weeks, Russian forces have intensified their attacks in several key areas of a more than 1,200km-long (745 miles) battlefront.\nAlongside Mariinka, they have been trying to encircle Avdiivka - another key town near Donetsk.\nUkrainian forces are seeking to extend their bridgehead on the left (eastern) bank of the Dnipro river in southern Ukraine.\nLast week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the country's military were planning to mobilise up to 500,000 extra people - although Gen Zaluzhnyi denied on Tuesday that the military had issued a request for any specific number of troops.\nPresident Zelensky's comments come as Ukraine is facing an ammunition shortage amid aid setbacks from its key allies in the US and the EU.\nKyiv's counter-offensive ground to a halt at the start of winter and there are fears that the Russians could simply outgun Ukraine.\nBut there was some good news for Ukraine on Tuesday, as Russia's defence ministry confirmed that one of its warships was damaged in a Ukrainian attack on the port of Feodosiya in occupied Crimea. One person was killed, officials said.\nThe head of the Ukrainian Air Force said warplanes had destroyed the landing ship Novocherkassk, used for moving troops and heavy equipment, in the early hours of Tuesday.\nMr Shoigu gave details on Tuesday of the damage to the ship to President Vladimir Putin, before declaring that Russian forces had brought Ukraine's counter-offensive to a halt and were now pushing forward on all fronts.\nRussian state TV had earlier shown him telling Mr Putin: \"The assault detachments of the South group today completely liberated the settlement of Mariinka, which is five kilometres [three miles] south-west of Donetsk."}

They believe Lee took his own life, Yonhap news agency reports.\nPolice said earlier they had received a report that he had left his home after writing a note.\nHe had been under investigation for alleged illegal drug use since October.\nLee's body was taken to Seoul National University Hospital after police located his car near Waryong Park. Reports say his family have refused an autopsy and he will be buried on Friday.\nPolice have begun an investigation to establish the details around his death, including when he arrived at the scene where his body was found, and the time of his death.\nIn Parasite, Lee played the patriarch of the wealthy Park family which is infiltrated by members of a poor family posing as unrelated individuals. The vicious social satire won four Oscars, including best picture.\nYonhap reported that he was suspected of taking drugs such as marijuana and ketamine with a hostess at a bar in Seoul. He had said that though he took what she gave him, he had not known that they were illicit drugs.\nThe hostess had reportedly told the police that he used drugs at her home multiple times - something he denied. He had earlier requested through his lawyer to take a lie detector test.\nHis drug tests had returned negative or inconclusive results, the report added.\nPolice said they regretted that Lee had died in the midst of investigations, but that the inquiry had been \"conducted with [his] consent\", News1 Korea reported. Lee underwent three rounds of questioning, with one session last Saturday lasting 19 hours, according to Yonhap.\nLee's agency, HODU&U Entertainment, said in a statement: \"There is no way to contain the sorrow and despair. We respectfully ask that you refrain from spreading false facts based on speculation... so that [Lee's] final journey will not be unfair.\"\nNews of his death sparked strong reactions online.\n\"I can't imagine how difficult it must have been for him.

According to reports, some businesses were seen taking down posters and advertisements featuring Lee from their stores.\nDrug offences, including those involving usage of marijuana, are considered serious crimes in South Korea. Consumption of marijuana carries prison sentences of up to five years.\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has vowed a crackdown on drugs. This year, the country's authorities expanded its drug crimes department and the national police chief promised \"a total war\" on drug crimes.\nLee is not the only South Korean celebrity who had been investigated for drug use recently.

They also now include six shelters hosting about 61,000 displaced people, mostly from the north.\nThe residents have been told to move immediately to shelters in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah, which is already struggling to cope with several hundred thousand displaced people.\nThe UN human rights office said on Tuesday that it was gravely concerned about the continued bombardment of the Middle Area and its densely populated camps, citing a report from Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) that Deir al-Balah's al-Aqsa hospital had admitted 131 dead following Israeli strikes on Maghazi and Bureij on Sunday.\nIt also warned of a \"deepening and already catastrophic humanitarian situation\", saying that all roads connecting the three camps had been destroyed and that any shelters and hospitals still operating were critically overcrowded and under-resourced.\nA Palestinian woman living in the UK, Alaa, told the BBC that her family had been in Maghazi during Sunday's strikes and were \"having to live with... constant loss, constant fear\".\n\"Pulling people from under the rubble and losing friends, losing family members, being displaced, losing homes,\" she said. \"My four-year-old nephew, he had to evacuate with my family the other day and he was crying, asking for his dad who was killed a month ago.\"\nThe IDF's chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, warned that the fighting with Hamas was taking place in \"a complex area\" and would therefore \"continue for many more months\".\n\"There are no magic solutions or shortcuts in the fundamental dismantling of a terrorist organisation, except persistent and determined fighting, and we are very, very determined,\" he added.\n\"We will also get to the Hamas leadership, whether it takes a week or months.\"\nHe was speaking amid new signs of rising regional tensions with incidents linked to Iran-backed groups in the Red Sea, on the Lebanese border and in Iraq.\nIn his first interview since the start of the war, the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas - a political rival of Hamas who is based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank - said it was unprecedented in Palestinian history.\n\"What's happening in the Palestinian territories is far beyond a disaster and far more than a genocide. The Palestinians have never seen anything like this,\" he told Egypt's ON TV.\n\"Even during the Nakba catastrophe in 1948. What's happening today is far worse,\" he added, referring to the Middle East war that followed Israel's declaration of independence in 1948, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes.\nMr Abbas also warned that the West Bank could implode at any time.\nOn Wednesday, six Palestinians, including a 17-year-old boy, were killed in a drone strike during an Israeli raid on a refugee camp near the western West Bank town of Tulkarm, according to the Palestinian health ministry.\nThe IDF said six \"armed terrorists\" were killed in an air strike after they threw explosive devices at troops carrying out an operation to arrest wanted people."}

Former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis said history would \"judge him harshly\".\nWolfgang Schäuble joined the conservative CDU party in 1965 and entered the Bundestag seven years later when he was 30. \nAs interior minister of West Germany, he co-signed the treaty in East Berlin that unified the country in August 1990.

He was its longest-serving MP, winning 14 constituency elections.\nIn a speech to the European Parliament four years ago, Wolfgang Schäuble said that without European unification, east and west, there would have been no German reunification, and he warned that the \"rules-based international order was under pressure\".\nHe withdrew from frontline politics only last year."}
