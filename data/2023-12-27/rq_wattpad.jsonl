Slowly an image began to come to my mind. It was blurry at first, but with each moment I could see more and more of the figure. When I saw almost everything, it turned out that I was lying on the bench and Carolina and Alex were standing above me.- What happened ? - I said and wanted to get up, not really knowing what was happening. Alex held me in a sitting position so that I wouldn't get up.- You fainted - Alex said calmly- Give me the phone - I said with tears in my eyes, because only now I realized what had just happened.- What for ? - Carolina asked now.- Give me the phone! - I said in a raised voice. Carolina handed me the phone and I dialed my mother's number.-Is that true? - I asked into the phone when my mother answered. I could barely hold back my tears. It was always obvious that my parents loved each other very much, although my father was not always nice to me, but he was almost always nice to my mother. I couldn't imagine life without one parent. - Is what dad told me true? - I asked my mother again- Yes, honey - said mother and before hanging up she added - Sleep at someone's place, father has had a drink. Don't come homeAlex and Carolina sat down next to me. I noticed a crowd starting to gather around us. Emily came to us, when she saw what was happening, she turned off the music and started talking into the microphone:  - Party's over, everyone go home - and added when she saw that Ethan started to get up - Ethan, you're staying - everyone started get ready - What happened? - asked Carolina. - I'll tell you later - I said through tears - Someone take him home - I added, pointing to Ethan- Lucas and I will go to pick him up and we'll come back to you later - said Carolina and approached Ethan, next to whom a blond-haired boy was standing. It had to be her Lucas, her new boyfriend. When they left, there was no one there. Alex hugged me and I put my head on his shoulder and started crying louder  - Will you tell me what it is? - he asked me-No! - I screamed and jumped up. ......Why can't guys just sit quietly and console? They always have to know everything.He stood up too. - Rosie?, what's going on - he asked - Shit! - I screamed and ran to the car. I got into it and drove off, I don't know where yet. Ahead I didn't know what was happening to me, why did I shout at Alex? I guess I just wanted someone to hug me and not say anything. But that doesn't explain it to me. What the fuck is happening to me? What I am doing ?I stopped near the house and called Maya. Maya was my older sister who lived in Boston with her boyfriend and had already graduated from college 2 years ago. - Hello? - she said, answering after just two rings.- Hello Maya, I have a question - I said, my voice a little broken after crying and I felt like crying again. I hated the fact that I always felt like crying so quickly - You already know? - she asked- Mhm - I murmured - Sure, come, it's best to pack for a week, I'll get you leave from school and buy a train ticket - she said, guessing what I meant. That's why I loved her so much, I didn't have to say almost anything, and she always knew what I meant.- Thank you - I said quietly and said goodbye to her.Such a sister is a treasure...I threw my phone on the seat next to me and headed home. I parked the car in front of the house and left. It would be inappropriate of me to disobey my mother and enter the house normally. So I walked around the house and approached my balcony, opposite which there was a large tree. Sometimes I climbed it to sneak out of the house for a while. I was planning to do it this time too. I remembered that I had left the balcony closed, so I didn't have to worry about it. While climbing the tree, my dress tore in one place, but I didn't care much about it.Once I was in my room, I locked the door from the inside while I packed. I changed the dress into jeans and a sweatshirt with a \"Gucci\" print because I couldn't find a better one for this occasion, I took a rather large suitcase for someone who goes away for a week and packed everything I would need during that time. I admit I was surprised, but it all took up my entire large suitcase. I took my phone, wallet, house keys, and lip gloss into my purse, unlocked the door to the room and sent a short text message to my mother.Somehow I managed to get over the balcony with this huge suitcase and 20 minutes later I was sitting on the train and looking at the dark sky and stars outside the window."}

They watched the once-imposing wooden mansion crumble to the ground, they felt a sense of satisfaction and relief wash over them. They had faced their fears and emerged triumphant, and nothing could stop them now.With the danger behind them, the trio walked away from the ruins of the mansion, their hearts filled with a sense of accomplishment and a newfound appreciation for their resilience and strength.The spirit world is a realm where humanly bound emotions like hunger are absent. It is a place where the trio can survive despite the dangers lurking around every corner. Every moment they spent there felt like a precarious balance between the real world and the cursed realm. They knew that a single misstep could lead to their separation from everything they knew and loved, leaving them trapped there forever. But they persevered, navigating the treacherous landscape and holding on to their hope of one day returning to the world of the living.The trio was brimming with confidence after their recent victory and decided to up their game by honing their skills even further. Cynthia, the sharpshooter of the group, chose a tree as her target practice and sometimes even challenged her precision by aiming at the passing spirits. Meanwhile, Ezra and Asher stumbled upon a group of malevolent spirits and quickly called Cynthia to help them defeat the fiends. Ezra and Asher, leveraging their unique abilities, weakened the spirits, and Cynthia delivered the final blow with precision and finesse, sending the evil spirits back to where they came from. The friends were thrilled to see their collective strength and teamwork in action, and they knew that they were ready for whatever challenges lay ahead.As Asher and Ezra ventured deeper into the mysterious spirit world, a sudden thought struck Ezra. He pondered aloud, \"If something can pull us down from the spirit world, then maybe we can use the same force to pull something up from the physical world.\" Intrigued by his friend's theory, Asher decided to test it out. He pushed his hand deep into the soil and felt something hard and cold beneath his fingertips. To his shock, he realized that it was a pair of human legs! With all his might, he pulled on them, but then he heard a faint voice calling out his name. It was Ezra's voice, but it was coming from outside the spirit world. Confused and terrified, Asher told Ezra what had happened. Together, they came to a horrifying realization that they had stumbled upon something far more sinister than they could have ever imagined.As Ezra gradually came to their senses, they realized with a jolt that they had descended from the ethereal realm and that they had pulled themselves into the spirit realm. Since time flowed differently in that otherworldly space, Ezra's sudden return to reality seemed understandable. However, what followed was anything but expected. A sickening feeling crept up on Ezra, as if they were being yanked back into the real world but something was not letting them. The prospect of being bound to that otherworldly realm sent shivers down their spine."}

Alam mo ba na si Finnegan Nicholson, ang Feng Shui master, ay espesyal na nagdisenyo ng bakuran na ito?\" Ngumisi si Rachel.Si Finnegan Nicholson ay isang mahusay na Feng Shui master noong fifties. Ang buong Carter Mansion, kasama ang pond, ay partikular niyang idinisenyo.Gayunpaman, binanggit ni Darryl na hindi maganda ang Feng Shui ng pond? Anong kalokohan yan?Natawa si Darryl at sinabing, “Oo, tama ka. Ayon sa Feng Shui, ang pond ay nasa magandang lugar.\"Siya ay patuloy na mahinahon na nagpapaliwanag, \"Gayunpaman, ang pond ay itinuturing na isang Yin-Yang pond. Ang hilagang bahagi ng lawa ay tumatanggap ng maraming sikat ng araw; kaya ito ay itinuturing na bahagi ng Yang, samantalang ang timog ay palaging nasa ilalim ng isang lilim, na ginagawa itong bahagi ng Yin. Noong idinisenyo ni Finnegan Nicholson ang lawa, ito ay sinadya upang balansehin ang Yin at Yang—ito ay isang Feng Shui pond, upang ilagay ito nang tumpak. Kaya, hindi ito para sa paglalaro, lalo na sa timog na bahagi. Ang enerhiya ng Yin ay masyadong malakas. Dapat lumabas kayong dalawa agad.\"Bulalas ni Sara sa paghanga habang pinapalakpak ang kanyang mga kamay, “Darryl, alam mo ang Feng Shui? Iyan ay napakahusay! ”Malamig na sagot ni Rachel, “Kalokohan ang sinasabi niya.Tignan mo siyang puro kawawa! Maglalaro tayo. Huwag mo siyang pakialaman.\"Aalis na sana si Darryl dahil hindi nila pinakinggan ang payo niya. Biglang sumigaw ang isa sa kanila sa lawa, \"Tulong!\"Sinubukan ni Rachel na panatilihing nakalutang ang sarili habang siya ay nalunod. Nagulat ang ilang maid, pati si Sara ay natulala.Agad na tumalon si Darryl. Mabilis niyang sinagip si Rachel at inilabas sa pond habang hinahangaan ang napakarilag nitong katawan. Siya ay nagkaroon ng magandang katawan.Nanginginig sa takot si Rachel.

Darkness took me once they heaved me onto the stretcher. It was a strange sleep - listless and heavy. At some points I was aware of what was happening around me and at other times, the darkness was so deep that I could have laid there forever. In that darkness, I saw things. The first Vidalin Rider cradling a small egg in his arms.  Jamie's voice whispering in the dark, pleading for me to come back. Forests burning – huts nestled in the wild torn apart. Places were shadows touched, flooding my mind.  The edge of a cliff, with a forest burning beneath me. A dragon with breath like ice, a great hunk of metal protruding from her chest. Twisting, turning in rage. Falling.  Her roar of rage lost in fire.I jerked awake. Above me, there was a mosaic ceiling that curved in the tubular room. The colourful tiles depicted stories of mer-people in different places. The long willowy mer-people who cut through warm crystalline waters. The mer-people who swam under glaciers and hunted in the pitch-black, with weight packed on to insulate them from the bitter cold.  A whole culture of people that I had never even considered, their species so vast that they spanned an entire world. Cotton itched my bare legs. I was bound by blankets, but worming myself free was easier than I expected. One arm was bound tight to my body, but I was able to prop myself up haphazardly and take stock of the room. It seemed to be a bedroom, with walls of periwinkle blue. I was swathed on a massive poster bed. On the locker beside me, a glass of cold water was left. Water droplets gleamed on the glass. At the far end of the room, an arched window with a frame made of gleaming white metal, overlooking a garden of eelgrass. A single statue, crafted from grey stone and gleaming pearls that glimmered like tiny moons, stood at the centre. A mer-woman, with cascading hair, a hand stretched up to the surface. Her tail was long and sweeping. It took me a second to realise that fins that lined the length of her tail were warped. Clipped. The great gossamer fins that ended her tail were bent, broken. I looked to her face again.  To the sadness etched on her immortalised face.\"Dragons are not the only ones who can be clipped.\" I muttered. There was a strong aftertaste of Tar in my mouth, lingering on my tongue like a film. My limbs shook as I swung my legs over the edge, a dull ache reverberating from my torso. I reached for the glass of water, only to see a sliver of shadow coiling around my wrist affectionately. \"Oh,\" I cooed, my voice rough. \"Welcome back.\" More shadow twined around my arms, rising like slithering snakes to kiss coolly against my cheeks. With tension easing around my shoulders, I stood. None of my weapons had been left in the room and my Rider's suit had been taken. All that I was left with was a nightgown that hung just above my knees, made of soft cotton. Fresh underwear too. Cleaned nails. Someone had washed my face too. The little rounded mirror over a small dresser showed only tired eyes and pink cheeks. My hair had been washed too, twisted away from my face, and bound with little bobbins with colourful ceramic fish on them. It was surprisingly sweet. The doorknob twisted and I reached for the white-bone comb, turning to face the incomer. Shadow hissed in my ear, roused by my alarm. A woman stepped inside, empty handed. Her skin was ochre dark, her hair pulled into twists that hung between her shoulders. Strength lined powerful shoulders and thick thighs. She stopped as she spotted me, her expression cool. \"Welcome back, Rider Lynch.\" She said. \"I am glad to see that you are awake now.\" That voice was familiar. Memories, broken by pain, came to me. \"Cryaeni?\" She pursed her bowed lips. \"You remember.\" \"I don't tend to forget the people I've kissed.\" \"I wouldn't flatter yourself, Rider Lynch,\" Her eyes gleamed with mirth. She stepped further into the room, scanning quickly before approaching. \"You've been asleep for some time.\" \"How long?\" \"Fifty-six seconds, two minutes, three hours and eleven days.\" I arched a brow. \"That was quick.\"\"The Lady tasked me with caring for you in Derralann. I take my assigned tasks seriously.\" Cryaeni explained. \"You have been given a private room in the visitors' quarters of Derralann, the only place within our home here that nonaquatic people can stay. A pity really. The rest of Derralann is steeped in history and splendour.\" Warmth flooded my mind. Like the kiss of a sea-breeze on a warm day, the gentle looming quiet of night. My attention diverted, a smile appearing. \"Nethore.\" \"Human,\" his mind melded with mine, warm and soft. \"You are awake.\" \"I am.\" \"Good. I missed you, human.\" \"Your dragon remains on the shore of Derralann lake. We have no means of housing him down in Derralann,\" Cryaeni blinked, \"Because of the barbs, the talons, and the fire we were afraid he would shatter the walls and all nonaquatic folk would drown. We have kept a rotation of guards on the shore to look over him as he mends. He even allowed one of our numbers to scrub his scales clean.\" Nethore hummed. \"They did good.\" \"You have taken care of us,\" I kept Cryaeni in focus as she moved through the room, a shadow on the door just in case.Cryaeni stared out into the garden with the sad, clipped mer-woman. Her face was reflected in the glass, staring back at me. \"You made a great sacrifice for the people of Ithrall, Rider Lynch.\" In my fresh clothes and bare feet, I felt vulnerable. \"Does it not bother people that they are surrounded by glass all the time. I mean, anyone can look in?\" \"No,\" She tapped the glass, \"It's one way.\" \"Oh,\" Instinctively, I reached for my waist, remembering too late that I didn't have my weapons belt. \"Where are my things?\" \"Being cleaned.\" A half-beat of panic. \"My blades are precious to me. They were a gift, and I don't want them damaged.\" \"We may not ride dragons high into the sky, Rider Lynch, but we know how to clean a blade.\"I pursed my lips, changing conversation again. \"I feel surprisingly good for someone who was close to death.\" \"We worked hard on you.\" \"And now? Am I hopped up on drugs?\" Lynch, Vidalin Rider and soon to be junkie.  My list of faults was creeping ever longer. Cryaeni bit down a puzzled smile as she turned around to me. \"The Lady would like to see you as soon as you are well and good.\" I rattled my brain for the Lady's name. Dem would have known that, along with probably her whole family tree. I wasn't so blessed to remember small details.  I barely kept my head above water in Valaxian schools, even before Acheron kidnapped me, stole my blood, tormented me, and locked me in darkness for months on end. Just a small life diversion.  \"I can meet the Lady now.\" \"Lady Nimaine will not mind waiting until your strength has returned further.\" \"Respectfully, Cryaeni, there isn't time for rest. Acheron has wiped out Ithrall and my fellow Riders are lost to the wind with the evacuees. I need to get to them as soon as I can.\" \"You will wear yourself thin, Rider Lynch.\" \"Impossible,\" I denied. And yet, I am a single strand of hair. She sighed. \"There are some fresh clothes in the wardrobe for you. They should be about your size.\"With that, she left. I was quick to change into a simple billowing pair of black trousers that swamped me and a cosy shirt. Without the use of my second hand, shadow helped me clip my bra into place. The girl now in the mirror looked years younger, wearing her sister's clothes. Which made me think of Jenna, which made me think of the others who would now think I was dead. Or were waiting for me to return.  And already eleven days had passed on top of those lost days in Ithrall.  Cryaeni met me outside. We walked along a long corridor made of glass, with water pressing down all around us. A shoal of fish lingered overhead. Occasionally, a long figure would streak past, impossibly fast.  \"There are many people here who would like to speak to you. Survivors of Ithrall.\"\"What?\" My head whipped to her.\"Those who ran from the fire, ran to the water. They began to swim, desperate to escape. Some drowned, but we managed to save many.\" Darkness shuttered her expression. \"We are still finding bodies floating in the dark. Derralann lake is far vaster than land-dwellers realise. People dive often, wondering if they can spot our city between the water but we are nearly six hundreds metres down, nestled in the pitch black and the cold water strikes most before they realise that it is a problem.\" \"I didn't realise the lake was so deep?\" \"Around the edges it is not. Some believe that the centre was hollowed and burrowed into by an ancient water Wyrm thousands of centuries ago.\" \"A worm?\" \"We call it that for ease of conversation. To me, it is a Coinchenn.  An ancient monstrous creature, hatched in the deepest parts of the ocean. They can traverse from the deep to the lighter waters, living centuries and growing to abominable sizes. They are rarer than they once were.\"  \"I have never even heard of it.\" Cryaeni pulled a blade from her waist. It was a dagger, made of bone. The edge was wicked sharp, enough to slice open skin at the slightest pressure. \"This is the bone of one. Impossibly strong. I have beat it against rocks, against armour and scale and it did not dull or shatter.\" \"I still don't really know what they are?\" \"They are a vile stain on this world. Imagine a merge of fish, whale and octopus. It has a great mouth of teeth that crush ships like they are nuts. Great tentacles in fully grown Coinchenn can be several miles long. They can sleep for years, burrowing deep into the ocean bed and using the rocks to sustain them until they are ready to go again.  In their nesting, they have wiped out thousands of unsuspecting humans as their waves wash over land.\"  Cryaeni sheathed the blade. \"At least once a generation, there is a massacre. A Coinchenn will emerge from the dark depths and grip a Mer-city with its tentacles, descending downwards with its circular, churning typhoon mouth. The current is near impossible to escape, and the feed can send them into a slumber for centuries.\" \"They sound terrifying.\" I eyed the sheathed blade. \"Then how did you get a bone from the Coinchenn?\" \"I killed it.\" Cryaeni stated. She touched the hilt absently. Around us the walls of glass turned to white stone, and it became clear quickly that we were walking inside a cave system. It broadened quickly until it bloomed out into a colossal size- at least ten kilometres tall and wide. Our footsteps echoed.\"I wasn't born here in Valaxia.  I grew up in one of the many towns in the Atlantic Ocean. The ocean is not just water, fish, and rock. There are great cities built deep below, safe from the exploration of humans. Our people in the governments of the world aim to stir interest away from deep-sea exploration.\" Her voice grew distant. Wistful.\"My home, OniOnu, was just a small town of several thousand. I cannot remember and there are no records left to confirm either.\" Her smile was bitter. \"I was a young mer-woman, eager to experience life beyond the water. It was customary for mer-people to spend a year or two on land to strengthen their land-legs. If you wanted to be a warrior, then you would spend longer. I turned fourteen and a small group of us were taken to land to train. We went to great cities, then vast forests where the air was so thick with moisture that my gills would rise to taste it. I trained to fight, to act as they did so there would never be any suspicion that I was anything other than human. Three years I spent away from home, cut off from OniOnu completely.  My friends and I returned to find nothing of the town. Just a great shelf of rock, the surface grinded by great teeth. The marks of powerful suckers surrounded the walls of the shelf that the town perched on.\" Oh mo Dhia. \"A Coinchenn had eaten it. The entire town.\" Her voice twisted, tightening. \"There were twenty of us who remained, everyone of us having spent the last few years on land. The water had never seemed so lonely and vast to me until then. A great cold darkness that was so quiet.\" \"Cryaeni,\" Horror clogged my throat. \"I am sorry.\" She shook her head. \"The attack had been recent. We had missed it by a week, maybe less. We just...made a collective decision to hunt it down. After a feast like that, it would go into hibernation again. Perhaps my great great great grandchildren would be around to see it wake.  By then, it's devastation would be dulled. The town would be rebuilt somewhere else. Life would have moved on, ripe for another Coinchenn massacre.  I couldn't let that be. We hunted it and killed it. A Coinchenn is weakest right before their slumber, dulled by the feed and drowsy.  Of the twenty who hunted it, only three survived the fight and subsequent wounds. We rebuilt OniOnu using its bones and I hear now that the town is on the precipice of becoming a city, the regrowth has been so quick.\" \"You did not stay?\" \"It has the same name as my childhood home, but it isn't.\" She shrugged her shoulders. \"But it is safe from most predators now. Even young Coinchenn would not go near a place forged from Coinchenn bones.\" \"So, you moved to Valaxia?\" \"I did. The High - Queen of the Atlantic contacted Lady Nimaine and I travelled here and presented her a matching blade to mine.  She took me into her service immediately and I have been here ever since.\" Cryaeni snorted, casting me a look. \"So, my people are sensitive to cities being wiped out, to people fleeing from devouring monsters. We helped who we could. Nearly a thousand now reside in our caves here, families in the one room and our resources are stretched thin. But we will make it work.\" \"You all are doing great things here.\" She had no reply for that, and we walked in silence before turning a corner. At the end of the hall, a set of double doors that stretched three stories high loomed. The handles, as thick as my torso and gleaming like shined pearls. The door itself seemed to be made with two panes of thick glass. There two panes were separated by dark water.  Fish, long and colourful shot through the gap in the doors, pausing at the door handles before shooting away once more. It swung open noiselessly. Light spilled into our hallway and the splendour of this hidden haven beneath the water, continued to rattle me. It was a cavernous room that rose, up up into a ceiling crafted of thick glass. The lake sat above us. The cavernous room could have easily housed several hundred.  At most, there were two hundred here at the minute. They were spread throughout the great room, squashed together on armchairs, lying on their stomachs, and playing dog-eared board-games. Some sat reading in quieter spots. Several young children lay on their backs, watching the water against the glass above. Nestled amongst them was a baby, no more than a few months old, dribble on her chin as she stared above her. When a light from the room hit the glass, it sent it back dancing across the floor. The baby kicked her chubby legs, her gummy smile followed by a pitch of giggles.Someone noticed us. Then another. Like a hush following like a blanket of snow, the room was silent. I could feel the weight of it, a solemness that I knew was meant for me.  There was no hiding who I was. I had been plastered enough times across papers to be unable to hide, even without the shock of hair, the Mark, or the shadows that whispered across my skin. I stayed still, watching them. Uncowed not, unlike before, there was no room for shame now. The whispering began and that I was familiar with. The whispering. How shameless they were to whisper now, when I was weak. The water was heavier than the dark.  The whispering broke into a cacophony of noise, too sudden for me to mask my surprise. There was joy in that noise, frequent cries of 'she's alive!' ringing out. People came forward, brave people, to reach out for my good hand. They were not buffered by my recoil, or the switch in my stance. They kept a step back, continuing to stare. Only a few days ago, these people would have hated me.  That was enough to keep me rankled – their fickleness could turn so quickly. How did I know that tomorrow, I wouldn't be a villain again in their eyes? Well, the main man orchestrating my bad image was now dead in Ithrall. Hatred, putrid and rotten, curled in my gut at the thought of Malachi Basset. I didn't fear him. Not like I feared Acheron, or how I had been afraid of Amon. He had been a worm wearing a lion's gleaming mane. More people pressed forward to look. Many had been burned horrifically, the injuries so evident in the raw, red skin and the smell. It lingered in my nose, so heavy and thick that I could almost taste it.  Bandages around faces, arms, and legs. A small boy with mossy brown eyes staring at me, a jagged cut healing across his soft cheeks. A claw of some kind. The crowd parted for Cryaeni as she motioned for them to move, taking one look at my uncomfortable expression. I began to make my way through the crowd, trying to ignore their whispers.  A girl stepped out in front of us, deftly dodging her father's grasping hand. He made to step out into the pathway for her, balking back as I neared.  Paling, he began to apologise, \"Rider Lynch, I – she is quick for her age.\" She was a tiny thing. Bold and brass, she stared up at him unabashedly. Clutched in her hands was a ragged teddy bear, with ash and grime clinging to its fur.  \"The big Rider saved me. Is he your friend?\" \"The big Rider?\" The father rushed to explain, \"We were at a checkup in the hospital when the demons came. If the Rider on the Yesan had not come, we would have been killed as many others were.\" \"Peter Whyte,\" I gave her what smile I could, \"You were saved by Peter Whyte. A brilliant and brave Rider and his equally brave and brilliant dragon, Beau. What is your name?\" \"I am Emilia,\" She jerked her teddy-bear out, \"And this is Gus.\" \"Oh? Well, hello Gus. Nice to meet you. I hope Emilia has been taking care of you?\"She giggled at me, \"Bears don't talk, silly.\" Silly. The whispering stopped. The girl's father looked as if he was going to drop dead. \"I am silly, aren't I?\" I said softly, \"I think I'm a little tired.\" She pursed her lips, thinking. \"Then you need to go to sleep. Papae makes me sleep when I get grumpy.\"The matter-of-factness to her voice only made me laugh. A soft, quiet sound. Enough to break some of the growing tension. \"And do you sleep when your father tells you too?\" Emilia, a daring soul, stepped closer and gave a deft nod. She had to be no older than five, with massive round brown eyes and a curtain of brown-gold hair that had been neatly scraped back into a ponytail. \"Always.\" \"Are you telling me the truth?\" \"I swear!\" She said solemnly. \"Gus says so too.\" \"I thought bears don't talk?\" I arched a brow. \"He talks to me.\" \"Ah.\" She pointed to my hand, cradled tight to my chest. \"Does that hurt?\" \"Not now.\" \"Did it?\"\"Emilia,\" Her father said warningly. She didn't spare him a glance, sensing that she had only a short amount of time to get all the answers she wished. \"Is your big friend here?\" \"My dragon?\" \"Yes.\" \"He's above the water.\" \"Why?\" \"Emilia!\" \"He can't fit down here.\" She giggled again. \"He's too fat!\" \"I am not fat!\" \"He's a little chunky,\" I put my fingers to my lips. \"But don't tell him that.\" \"I promise!\" She whispered it, so serious in that vow. I wished for as long as possible, her biggest challenge would be keeping a small secret to protect the feelings of a vain, irate dragon. \"Emilia!\" Her father motioned at her furiously. \"Come back to me.\" Unbothered, she gave me a little wave with Gus' paw. \"I will see you later, Rider.\" My smile was soft and slight. \"I hope so.\" Cryaeni moved forward again. People continued to stare. If I had known that all I had to do, to get people to like me, was to drop an island on myself – well, I might have tried that months ago. \"Don't be like that,\" Nethore scolded. \"You also would have needed an invading army, a betrayal by a trusted Councilmember outed by you and the other Riders' aid. That is all.\" \"It is so comforting to know that I am really unlikeable.\" \"It is alright human. You have me.\" \"Ah. Stepping on a girl when she is down.\" \"Down where?\"  Nethore questioned. \"And I cannot step on you human. You are underneath water. If I wished and you were not so deep, I would dive and catch your body between my jaws and shake until your spine snapped. I would not do that though.\" We passed through the cavernous room and the doors shut fast behind us. Cryaeni took a breath. \"Come. We have kept the Lady of the Lake waiting long enough.\" "}

Isha, I think I love him!\"  \"You what.\" Ruqaiya had been talking about Yunus for the past few minutes, and now she's admitting she's in love with him?!I really hope whatever Daniyal was saying about that Daneen girl and Yunus was just harmless teasing, and not the truth. Ruqaiya cleared her throat. \"Listen Qai, I don't know if it's true but just yesterday\" I was going to tell her about what Daniyal had said but she cut me off. \"Enough about me! Aren't you excited? It's finally the day of your engagement!\" She said. Ah, Yes. It was the day of my engagement. The day I had been anticipating for the past week. I wondered if Harun was just as nervous but nonetheless excited as I was. After today, I would have a fiancé! And Harun.. He's literally the kind of guy I hoped I would get when I was 13 and found my love for reading romance books. \"I am excited Qai, but also worried.\" She made a face. \"What do you have to be worried  about?\" I was worried about her, not that I could tell her that.\"It's nothing, just some nerves I guess.\" \"Ruqaiya beta, can you call Yunus from Daniyal's room down the hall?\" Auntie called out. We decided that since my parents had booked the biggest room, we ladies would get ready there, so here we were, although we came earlier to chill before having to get ready. \"Alright, auntie!\" Ruqaiya said excitedly at the mention of Yunus. \"Isha, I'll be right back!\" With that she literally sped off. Just as she left, the rest of the girls came  in with my lehenga that I was supposed to wear and their own outfits. \"Ishu, you're going to look stunning..\" Amara said, her voice sounding a little shaky. \"Oh Amara, it's not like I'll leave forever after my wedding!\" I said trying to comfort her, although even my own voice came out in a shaky tone. We were all getting so emotional and it was only my engagement, who's know what'll happen when I get married. I looked over at Aai and Esh to see that even their eyes had a glossy hue. \"Group hug?\" I asked. \"Group hug.\" They replied collectively.                            RUQAIYA'S P.O.VAs I was reached Daniyal's room, I saw that the door was open. I was about to knock but I heard Yunus's voice. He was talking to Daniyal, but that wasn't my business, so I brought my hand up to knock, but ended hearing my name, which made me stop. I swore I was just going to see what they were saying about me and then proceed to do what I actually came here for. Daniyal continued-\"You know that Ruqaiya likes you, Right? You seem to like her too.\" He said, and my heart stopped, but I was also excited to know what Yunus thought of this.\"Huh? I think you've got it wrong. And you know that I like Daneen, anyways.\"  He liked... Daneen? It felt as if my heart was breaking. Just today, I had admitted to Isha that I loved him, only to find out he doesn't even like me. I used to think people were being dramatic when they would describe heartbreak online, but right now, I felt the exact same way they had said. I could feel my eyes filling up with tears, which I tried to fight, but I couldn't help it. First, one fell out, then two, and then four.\"Wait what, I was just joking yesterday. You actually like that girl?!\" Daniyal said in an astound tone.\"Obviously!\" Yunus said. I deep a deep breath, wiped my tears and composed myself. I could only hope that I could manage to stay this way until I went back to my girls. I finally knocked.\"Door's open, come in!\" Yunus called out, I really hope my voice doesn't crack while I speak. Once I went in, Daniyal looked at me and did a once over. \"You okay? You look like you've cried.\" He said looking concerned, and once he said that, Yunus looked over at me and raised a brow.\"No no, I'm fine. Uhm.. I just came to inform Yunus that auntie was calling him.\" Thank god I managed to speak with a normal voice. Yunus gave me a smile \"Alright, thanks Q.\" That nickname.. He started calling me that when we were kids.  \"Yeah, no problem. Anyways, I'll go back to the girls.\" With that I rushed off before he could join me. As soon as I went over to them, they immediately caught on and asked me what was wrong. I don't know why, but Isha had a kind of a knowing look on her face. I explained what had happened and they all were trying to comfort me, they knew for just how long I had been crushing on Yunus Amir. I finally managed to actually compose myself. I wasn't going to worry Isha, especially on her engagement day. \"I'll be fine, girls, really.\" I said giving them a genuine smile. \"If you say so, Qai. Isha, the makeup artist texted me, she'll be here soon.\" Eshal said. \"I'm done steaming your lehenga!\" Aaira informed Isha cheerily. \"Isha, Why don't you eat something right now? You might not get to eat for a while.\" Amara suggested.                             HARUN'S P.O.V  Today was the day of my engagement, and I felt quite happy, well really happy. After today, Isha would be unavailable to anybody, and in 2 months she'd be mine, officially. Isha's the only person that can get me excited like a school boy, although I was also feeling really stressed. The stocks of one of our family businesses was failing. I had really hoped that nothing bad would happen before my engagement or wedding but here I was. I don't want this stress to grow, or I fear I might end up flashing on someone when they didn't have anything to do with it. I especially feared flashing out on Isha. \"Bhaia! Come one, it's time to leave for your engagement!\"Alisha called out. My father had booked out an area for the engagement to take place. \"I'm done Alisha, I'll be right there.\" I went out of my room to see everyone waiting for. \"Let's go! My big brother's getting engaged!!\" Daniyal yelled out sso excitedly that probably the entire wing heard him, but I didn't mind, this was the happiest I'd seen him in a while. \"Bhaia, hurry up, bhabi's probably already waiting there!\" Yusuf said. Look at him, I haven't even married her yet, and he's already favouring his Bhabi more. \"Yea, what he said. Hurry up Bhaia.\" Yunus said. Oh wow. Seems both my twin brothers favour Isha more. I scoffed, \"I haven't even married her yet, and the two of you already favour her more.\" The two of them smirked and replied \"I thought we all knew that\" Yusuf said and Yunus joined \" hashtag team Bhabi.\" \"Whatever, let's go.\" And with that we left.                               ISHA'S POV Just as I came into the venue my engagement was taking place in and sat down on the stage where the seats for Harun & I had been placed, I saw him enter the hall.As he came up in the stage, he smiled at me \"After I put this ring back on you, you'll be off the market.\" He said. \"The same goes for you, Mr. Amir.\" I replied fighting a smile. My ring had been taken back so that Harun could put it on my finger in the hall, and his ring, which his fathers, had only been given to him yesterday, thought even that one was with Amara. She had both our rings.Soon enough, the venue starting filling up with guests who came up to the stage with gifts to greet Harun & I. Amara was sitting on the sofa right of the couch Harun and I were sitting on.Obviously, Ruqaiya, Aaira & Eshal's families were invited too, though they'd arrive a little later. We'd do the ceremony once they arrived.I could see Daniyal ogling Amara from where he sat in the sofa besides Harun. My eyes  searched for Ruqaiya from up here on the stage, but found Yunus. Talking to Daneen. I forgot that her family had been invited after all. It's not like Daneen was a bad person or anything, in fact from what I know, she was really nice, apparently. But, they that a friend to all is a friend to none.\"Ish, you okay?\" I looked over at Harun who looked concerned. \"Perfect.\" I smiled. \"Jiju, Isha, it's time for the ceremony! Qai, Eshal & Aai's families are here!\" Amara said excitedly, while getting the rings from the basket she had kept besides her. Both Harun and I stood up, with our families on the stage and the guests watching.\"Okay, jiju you'll be putting the ring on Isha first!\" Amara said giving us the rings.Harun took my left hand, and just before putting the ring onto my finger, he stopped looked at me and said-\"There's still time for you to escape, Isha.\" He said smiling. \"Because after this ring is on your finger, you're mine, and then officially after 2 months.\" He continued. I smiled at Haru the brightest I could in the moment.\"There's no one I'd rather have, Mr. Amir.\"  His eyes looked just a little glossy, mine did too, I'm sure.\"Alright then, soon-to-be Mrs. Amir.\" He said as he finally slid on my ring on. Our family broke out in cheers and came to hug the two of us. Daddy came first and I couldn't help but get emotional.\"You're becoming such a wonderful young woman, meri rani.\" He said, his eyes looking watery. \"You make us proud each day, Ishu.\" My mother said as she joined the hug. They greeted Harun too, not without daddy threatening him, obviously. After they stood at the side, the rest of our families came to greet us.After everyone had finally gotten done with the greetings and we finally sat down. Maybe now, Harun and I could have a proper conversation.\"Isha you look absolutely gorgeous.\" Harun complimented me. \"You don't look bad yourself, especially your sherwani. Who picked it? I wonder.\" \"Oh well, you know. She's just someone very special to me.\" I could help the gigantic grin threatening to break out. \"Is she, now?\" I asked teasingly. \"Very much so. She's not only special, but she's kind, beautiful, generous, smart and everything wonderful.\"  \"Hmm.. I dunno, man. Seems likes you have a crush on her.\" My grin wouldn't leave my face.\"That term compares not to what I feel for you. It's far too small, too simple to be what called what I feel for you.\" Okay, now my cheeks hurt from smiling. He, too had the biggest smile on his face. Ugh, I was starting to feel hungry, I should have listened to Mara earlier and eaten something. \"Amara, can you get me something to eat?\"  \"Sure, just give me a minute.\" With that she went off in the direction of the buffet. My girls looked so pretty, gold was the best choice to go with. \"Did you not eat anything earlier?\" Harun asked looking concerned. \"Nope\" I replied. \"Staying hungry isn't good for you, Ish.\" I have to admit, I love it when he's concerned about me. \"I won't do it again.\" I said \"I would hope not.\" He replied and Amara came back with a few starters. \"Here you go!\" She said, and just as I was about to take the player from her, she pulled it back. \"How are you going to eat with everyone watching you? Jiju why don't you feed her?\" She said. Oh some guts she had doing this. \"What difference does it make!\" I asked. \"It's okay, I don't mind.\" Harun said smiling as he took the plate from her hands. I turned over to glare at Amara, only to see her giggling and getting off the stage. \"Here, open your mouth.\" Harun said with a fork of some starter.

Word count:1.2kShadeOkay so the thing is... to be real with you I left some things out. Robbers did attack and rain did yell but the way it ended was real different, the one I told about was just well less violent so I went with that. But the guilt is killing me so I'll explain what really happened at the end.When Rain finally calmed down they still looked like they wanted to murder me. It was well... fun.... I guess. \"What do you mean love of your life?\" Millow asked just as confused as Yasi was. I hoped my Brian could work or my memories at least because I had a small memory of someone telling me something. I just forgot. UGHHH why did I have to have memory loss. Was this how Percy felt when he found out his memory was well gone? Probably felt worse than this.\"You need to practice\" Yah no thanks creepy voice. \"I told you my name is Crystal! Man you were way easier when you were a kid\" whoa thanks. Millow started talking asking questions than Yasi. The voice joined in the fray not literally because well only I could hear than rain started talking. My head was spinning and it was just way. To. Fucking. MUCH! \"EVERYONE JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!\" I shouted. Wait... I shouted that? Oh..Everyone just stared at me. \"Your eyes\" Yasi said. I saw the fear like the first time we met. I turned towards Millow. \"This time black\" she said simply. I looked towards rain which was a really horrible idea. They rushed towards me with a murderous look on their face. The next thing I knew was I was being held in the air while being choked by a person with a murderous look. \"Rain no stop!\" I heard Millow cry. I was fine. Sort of. Just my vision was fading and my lungs were burning. Just normal let me tell ya that. \"No this is a killer\" rain gritted through her teeth. My vision was fading very fast and before I knew it I blacked out. But.. um... why was everything black and white? I looked around until I saw 3 people. Instantly somehow I knew it was the rest of my friends. 1 girl (ish) and 2 non binary peeps. The girl had a rope tied around her throat. The middle person had 6 stab wounds and the last one had limbs in all the wrong places. It made me want to vomit. \"You did this to us\" they said in unison their voices warping in and out. I turned not wanting to look at them but I couldn't move. The faces of the 3 people started to contort. Warping into one than many. It was killing me. \"No no stop!\" It was crushing me I could barely breath. My legs collapsed my lungs burning. It felt like I was drowning but I couldn't there was no water in sight. It felt like I was being pulled in multiple directions and stabbed. It felt like my limbs were trying to twist into places they weren't supposed to go. \"This is how we felt, you killed us\" I whimpered but it came out raspy. I knew it this was the end. \"Please... please I'm sorry\" I couldn't take it. \"Please whatever I did I'm so sorry I'll-\" I couldn't finish that sentence. At that moment I blacked out for the second time. And this time I was in the woods. Police lights flashed off the trees sirens broke the silence of the night. I saw myself. I was standing over something. I wanted to get up and look but I couldn't move. I was stuck. \"Another memory\" Crystal explained, and this time I saw them. Or her? Crystal looked like me or more of had my skin color. She had black hair that went past her shoulders than stopped, she had a hand over her eyes. For some reason. She wore simple black cargo pants and a black top. A necklace with a weird symbol hung around her neck. On top of her head was that a halo? And horns? I looked down and saw she had a tail? This was weird. \"You were weird as a kid\" she explained, \"you loved fantasy so you made me like that now I can't change it the web has been spun to many times for it to unravel\" great more stupid physiology. \"Physiology isn't stupid you are\" she said I think she was rolling her eyes but she had a band over her eyes so who knows. \"Why why am I here?\" I asked. \"Your brain is reprocessing, you'll be here awhile\" what does that mean?! \"Your memories are stirring, your mind is realizing that there are memories missing so it's going through each one to figure out what is and how to fix it, and since you blacked out you're going on the trip to help\" oh boy! That sounds fun! I was being sarcastic it isn't. \"Okay look I don't want to be here, this is to much I just got tortured and well I just don't wanna be here\" I said, \"I want to leave go\" \"Hmm... to bad\" whoa this person was mean. \"Hey officers I think there's another body\" I heard someone say. \"Wait... hold up that's not supposed to happen\"\"Oh really? There isn't supposed to be more bodies?!\" I asked sarcasm still dripping on each word. \"Just shut up\" she snapped. \"Okay fine then\" I muttered. I saw an officer step closer, but before they could see me they fell unconscious. \"Your brain is messing your memories up, shit! This isn't good\" Crystal said raking a hand through her hair. \"Oh really?\" I asked. \"Didn't I tell you to shut the fuck up?\" She snapped. Yah but I don't care. She paced around. \"What about the officer?\" I asked trying to point to the officer on the floor. This time I could. I tried getting up and turns out I can. Crystal looked in my direction shocked.\"You can move?\" She asked. I nodded.\"I guess so\" I mumbled. \"This means either your brain is letting you or your powerful I choose the first one\" whoa this person was so kind... She seemed in deep thought. \"Why do you wear a band? On your eyes?\" I asked, \"is it a fashion choice?\" I added. \"No.. it's to protect others\" she said.\"Why, do you have laser eyes?\" I asked excitedly. \"No. Anyone who looks into my eyes dies\" that killed the mood. If we had any. \"You need to go this trip isn't going well, if you interfere it could alter everything it could change the outcome and it wouldn't be good\" she said. \"But that's good! I could change this I could make sure everyone survives!\" I urged. \"No... they are already dead you can't change that\" this was horrible. I could change and Crystal wouldn't let me. \"I'm not not letting I'm just telling you it's a bad idea\" she said and sighed.This time I got really angry. \"No you're stopping me from letting me change anything\" I said coldly. She sighed than turned. No. I wasn't gonna let her turn and leave like that. I ran up to her and grabbed the first thing in reach. Which was the band over her eyes. And I pulled. She yelled and looked shocked. I looked up to her eyes than stopped dead. Her eyes... they werePurple....Oh no! The mystery just got worse! Yikes! Have a nice day and take care of yourself! Bye lovelies! -Dumb idiot 🤌🏾"}

I was moving towards Avanti's room when I passed Maa Papa's room where I saw Papa holding Maa's saree and asking her to let him go outside.I just giggled looking at them and how they were looking so adorable and I moved towards my room to check whether my cute husband was asleep or not.I entered my room the only thing I could find was darkness I was about to shout when a hand covered my mouth and sensing the touch I relaxed as I knew it was Vinni.He whispered in my ears \" Jaan! Don't open your eyes please\" and I did what he said and I could hear some footsteps going away from me.I felt him holding my hands and he said \"Now open your eyes\" and I opened my eyes just to be left awestruck seeing the beautiful scene unfolding in front of me.I saw him holding a big sorry card while he was sitting on his knees and the whole room was filled with sorry cards and a bouquet everywhere. This just melted my heart immediately and he stood up coming near me.I was having happy tears in my eyes while he stood in front of me holding his ears and making a pout. He said \" Biwi please maaf kardo na galti ho gayi haan hum ladke hi bahar ghumte hain ab maaf kardo bas hogaya na jane do hume bhi bahar please \"(Wifey! Please forgive me. I accept that we boys always go out. Now please forgive me Please let me go out  )He was looking so cute at the moment I wish I could just sit and watch him like this for hours but it struck me that we were having a challenge and it brought a smirk to my face.I elegantly took steps towards bed and took a tulip lying on the bed and said \" Aur agar hum aapko maaf karna hi nahi cahate toh...\"(And what if I don't want to forgive you)His face sulked more and I couldn't control my laugh but just kept giggling and he saw this and glared at me but it did nothing but make me laugh more and more.Suddenly I was hovered over by him and the next moment he tickled me so much that I was about to die due to laughter.We just looked at each other and we kept looking at each other with I don't know what but It was an unknown feeling taking place in my heart and I was feeling so happy about this feeling being there but with this feeling, a fear was growing.I just slept in his arms while shrugging away those thoughts and leaving in MY PEACE, MY HOME.-------------Author's POVThe huge hooting voice was coming from the hall of Shekhawat's mansion. It was of the men of the house when their wives forgave them for going out every time and now they were happy as they were allowed to go out.Everyone was gone for their work when the duo -Yashashvini and Avanti were chilling in their room. Suddenly a head popped out in the room \" Bhabhi May I come in ?\" Aditya said mimicking the average fourth-class student.Seeing him Avanti rolled her eyes and this didn't go unnoticed by Yashashvini, she just said \"Of course, Aditya come in\" he came in and sat with us.Yashashvini excused herself from them saying she was bringing some snacks and moved out of the room. She moved out and stood behind the door peeking inside just like a detective.In the room, Aditya said \" Waise Avanti ji aapka shaadi wagerah ka kya plan hai \" ( Miss Avanti!What are your plans for marriage?)This was enough for Avanti to snap at him and she said \" Dekho mujhe sab pata hai tum do din see ye jo mujhe aankh maar rahe ho, line maar rahe ho bohot ho gaya tumhara mujhe koi interest nahi hain tum mein bas kardo \"(See I know everything, the way you are winking at me, the way you are flirting with me. this is enough of you. I have no interest in you so just please, It's enough )This all was seen by Yashashvini who was seeing all this and was dancing because her brother-in-law liked her best friend and the amount of happiness she was feeling was unbelievable.She entered the room dancing with a constant smile on her face and both of them awkwardly looked at her and seeing their looks she stopped dancing.She looked at them and stopped smiling and then they asked her \" Snacks kahan hai ?\"(Where are the Snacks?)She facepalmed at her stupidity and went back to bring the snacks by the time she came into the room she saw an angry Avanti and a scared Aditya.She calmed down Avanti and asked Aditya what happened while he said \"Are bhabhi kuch nahi mere aankh mein kachra gaya that to bas mein to palak jhapka raha that inhe laga ki mein inhe aankh maar raha hum aur ye devi hum par gussa karne lagi \"(Sister-in-law, It just something got into my eyes and I was blinking them to get the dust away and she thought that I was winking at her and got angry with me)-------------Another chapter!

I came back from London yesterday to attend Radhi's sister's wedding . She is my bestfriend.It's the wedding day and Isha my other bestfriend joined us today . She was shocked to see us . We all changed a lot in this ten years . The room is filled with laughter and chaos . This happens when you meet your bestfriends after ten freaking years . I missed us so much . Our families are close too, really close.Me and Isha are childhood best friends , Radhi joined us in our high school days . Since then we all became bestfriends . We all went to different countries cause of an incident and moreover for higher studies and establishing our careers . \"You all look so different\" Radhi exclaimed.\"Girl we all had a glowup\" I added . Then we had some chat about our old days . Later,I had a meeting to attend , Isha was tired too and Radhi had to look after the arrangements afterall it was her sister's wedding ,so we all left for our respective rooms.My meeting got over . I checked the time by my watch , it showed 1:00pm . I thought of taking a nap as I was tired or else I won't be able to enjoy the wedding tonight. I set the alarm at 3:00pm . I woke up and I was really late , It was 4:00 . My alarm as usual I didn't hear it , what can you expect from a heavy sleeper like me . Isha gave me 30missed calls. I freaked out .I jumped from bed and went to the washroom to freshen up . I called Isha and Radhi and asked them to come to my room. We all got ready in my room . I wore a golden lehenga where as Isha wore a red saree which complimented her curves , Radhi wore her royal blue sharara which was accentuating her regal charm adding touch to her beauty .\" DAMNN GURLSS YOU GUYS LOOK SO DAMN HOT & PRETTY !!!\" I yelled. \"Says who ? \" added Isha .\"Wait Pari, you are wearing traditional ?? Are you our Pari ??\" Radhi said in her dramatic tone, she is always the drama queen of our group.Before I didn't like wearing traditional clothes much so their reaction is quite valid here. Then we all went to the terrace. We all were hooting as the groom made his grand entry . As soon as groom's men heard us hooting , they looked up at us and my brown orbs met his hazel blue orbs . My face pale, not only mine but Radhi's and Isha's too. As both Heyansh and Nil were there too. Isha rushed out from there and me and Radhi followed her .\"Are you okay Isha ?\" I asked concerned.Radhi asked the same . \"I am fine girls, I just need some time\" said Isha gloomily .I angrily said \"Ignore him Isha\" .Man I hate my cousin for hurting Isha , as much as I love him , I hate him now for doing that to her . Radhi added \"Let's avoid them girls\" . We agreed with Radhi and went to attend the the rest of the functions. It was all so fun pulling Rishab jiju's legs and asking money . Rishab jiju said teasingly that we are his beautiful Salis (sister in laws ). I could see the boys giving death glares to Rishab jiju, which was actually very funny. After that we all went our separate ways . I was exploring the backside of the hotel which was the garden area, a bit far from the main event area. It was too noisy out there, I wanted fresh air. Well fresh air and peace is all I thought I do be having . But God seem to have some other plans for me. I noticed that the flowers in one of the pillar were falling off , there were no workers here to fix it , so I thought of doing it by myself . I took the ladder and climbed on it . I was done fixing the flowers. While getting off the ladder , I lost my balance and was going to touch the ground. I closed my eyes.After few minutes I realized I didn't fall . Someone's muscular arms were holding me . I opened my eyes and it was him. Our eyes locked. He looked at me so intently that I felt he is looking through my soul. He had wonderful hazel blue eyes , not the one which drowns you in but the one which makes you a little more alive. The ones which looks cold but deep inside it gives warmth and emotions which he is hiding. His face shone in the moonlight . GOD HE STILL HAS AN AFFECT ON ME . He averted his eyes and placed me down gently . I muttered a small \"Thank You \" and he walked pass without saying a thing, rude jerk .After a while I reached the main event area to check whats going on there . Isha informed me that she stole the shoes. We high fived . While talking with Rishab jiju ..the boys were smirking and Heyansh was missing . I informed Isha to check if the shoes were safe. Isha came running and informed that the shoes are missing . Radhi and I excused ourselves from the guest . We all went separate ways to find the shoes , but we didn't get them . Radhi said with anger, \" Humlog unko jitney nahi de sakte yaar , kisi bhi tarah jute dhundne honge. \" (we can't let them win , we have to find the shoes anyhow).Isha said she has a plan to get the shoes. We went to Rishab jiju and asked for money pretending the fact that we have the shoes. Soon we heard Heyansh shouting and Prisha with the shoes in her hand running. Heyansh followed Isha and they were fighting ,Heyansh was holding one end of the cloth whereas Isha the other . Isha left the side of the rope to which Heyansh stumbled back finding it as a cue she ran . Heyansh composed himself and ran after her. I saw Ayan following them . No way I am letting this doctor get this shoes so I followed suit . I reached near the pool side and I saw Heyansh pinning Isha to the wall and the shoes were floating,just then Ayan came and took the shoes which were floating in the pool . I tried taking it from him but he ran .I ran behind him to terrace and there he was. He was looking hot, Damn Pari, not a time to think this all your main focus is to get the shoes . I noticed him checking me out , I smirked and said something to which I know he would be shocked and taking that as a cue I stole the shoes from him and ran to my girls. I said smirking to the groom's men, \" Aye the bade humse joota churane\" (huh? Came to steal shoes from us ) . Radhi and the other bridesmaid started laughing towards them . The boys were so done . Rishab jiju had to give us money and later we returned his shoes .Soon I saw Radhi dancing with the other bridesmaid on the song and she dragged me too . I realized that Prisha and Heyansh were nowhere to be seen, God knows where they are ,I hope she is fine . After a few mins I saw Isha coming towards us with a done look, I am damn sure they had a fight .Rishab jiju said in his playful tone, \"Girls stop ! don't think this is a win , we got another challenge for you, right boys? \" , the groom's men hooted in a yes .Isha confidently asked \" What's that , whatever it is we will surely win that too , right girls\" and this time we hooted yes. It was a dance challenge, we scoffed and said \" So it's a challenge then get ready to lose again \" . \"Boys show them the thumka , Dikha do ki sher ha kon \" Rishab jiju hooted Radhi went to stage from the brides side and we all hooted for her ,. She was dancing on \" Laal ghagra \" . Her moves set the stage on fire and I could see the boys specially my cousin Nil's eyes fixed on her. Well, as soon as Nil found other boys checking my best friend he clenched his jaws and started glaring at them. The thought of him being still so whipped for our Radhi made me chuckle.Regression to mean maybe?It was time for the groom side to perform. It was Ayan and Heyansh performing on \"Sauda khara\" and \"Desi boys\". I was so shocked seeing Ayan dancing ,though he was the best dancer in our high school days but seeing the grumpy doctor dancing was not on my bucket list for sure. Heyansh was dancing well too, after all whose cousin.I could hear Rishab jiju hooting \"That's my boys\" . I saw Prisha looking at Heyansh, her eyes were reflecting pain and maybe hurt too, and all the time Heyansh kept his eyes on her just like he used to. Soon, their performance got over .As soon as their performance got over, Isha and I were called on stage. We performed on \"Jhalla wallah \" and \"Desi girls\". All the time during the performance, I could see Ayan stealing glances at me. Ayan and Heyansh both were pretending like they didn't care, but Prisha and I both knew the effect we had on them so we winked at each other before walking to the boys. Hah, time for a show.\"Music change, please.\" I said to the DJ artist who at once changed it.\"Play, 'Perfect' of Ed Sheeran.\" Prisha ordered in her commanding yet sweet voice.The song started playing and we pulled the two boys with us in the stage. Prisha and I might be emotional fools sometimes but not always. Taking the lead, we put their hands on our waist while our hands were behind their necks. Ayan had a very funny look on his face, the one of when you wake up in the wrong side of the bed. Looking at him almost made me crack up. We moved in harmony, and synchronising steps. Our eyes were locked and soon he took the lead as if showing he was still the one holding power.My eyes swept at my best friend. Prisha and Heyansh's movement were a mesmerizing blend of elegance and passion. As they twirled, I could feel the palpable chemistry between them. I was so lost in his embrace I didn't realise when the song was over. Claps and hootings of the spectators brought me out from my pool of imaginations. We pulled apart from each other and walked away.After our performance, from the groom's side Nil came on stage as much as I know my cousin , he is not a dance type person . He gave us all a surprise by playing the guitar and the song , he was singing \"Tum se hi \". I knew him to be a good singer but seeing him play guitar like a professional caught me off guard.Every lyric becomes a whispered confession, each note a token of devotion. Nil's voice carried the warmth of love as he poured his emotions into the song, creating a moment of intimacy amid the sea of listeners present in the hall. The song became a shared serenade, who was ready to bing him and Radhika.Radhika was shocked too , she came to me and asked \" Tune kabhi nahi bola tha ki tere bhaiya ko guitar bajana bhi aata ha. \"( You didn't say that your brother knows how to play guitar )I shrugged and replied \" mujhe bhi aaj pata chala \" ( Even I got to know just now). Once Nil was done with his performance, Radhika said \" It's not done , it is a dance battle. \"Nil said in his confident tone \"Alright, as you say , be ready to lose then. \"Radhika rolled her eyes and Walked to us. \"Isha, Pari suna nah uss gadhe ne kya kaha?\" (You guys heard what the donkey said?)\"Relax darling, let's show them how to lose.\" I winked at her.This time we three went together to perform on \" Chamak challo , kala chashma and tareefan \". All the while, the three boys kept smirking and I could sense something was terribly wrong. My gut feeling came true when all of a sudden the stage broke and we three fell down.Nah! We didn't actually fall down, the three boys caught us. Their was a smug on their face as they scoffed and said, \"So, who is loosing now?\"\"This is cheating.\" I heard Prisha whinning. \"Do you have any proof bandarni?\" Heyansh retorted.\"Just put us down.\" I said this time out of anger.The three of them put us down at once and high fived.\"They are only two ways of winning ladies.\" Nil said.\"Number one, Either you win yourself.\" Ayan followed.\"Number two, or eliminate the opponent.\" Heyansh said.We three girls stood there dumb founded but none of us stood back from glaring.Soon we heard the elder's calling for the vows so we all went to the mandap (booth).𝗦𝗽𝗼𝗶𝗹𝗲𝗿 : \"You emotionless robot \" Radhika said anger visible on her face.Only if she knew what an emotional fool my brother was.Chapter Aesthetic'sGroom's menBride's maidsParidhi & AyanPrisha & HeyanshParidhi and PrishaRadhika's danceNil playing guitarHeyansh and AyanThe girl's danceAuthor's note:Please follow, vote and comment as it motivates us to write better."}

I shall escort her\" She smiled, while arjun took a back step. Malini grabbing keys from pocket she left with gouri escorted by security. A smile drawn on omkara's lips while he saw arjun stood silent. Turning the computer off, he took out a candy from his pocket. Throwing it in his mouth. He leaned leisurely in chair. ____________________________A home where room wasn't so bright. The sounds of woman moaning sounds could heard. Naked on the sofa with a girl on bottom, a man savouring her like an animal not caring his surroundings. The room has two more men, who dressed in black kurta and pant guarding the man on sofa with guns hanging around their shoulder. After like one hour, he fell in sleep. The very next room, 4 members in white kurta and long beard playing carrom. \"Here is my shot\" One of them said while striking striker on white coin that directly went in hole.. He proceeded to strike another. One of them, casually leaned down \" Seems fazeer was done with her, you people play I will go \"the man who about strike, held his hand stopping him to go. \" Mansoor, whoever strike pink coin into hole they can have her now. \" Hinayat gave a smirk. \"Taking a chair, let's go\" Mansoor said in hurry. Hinayat passed the striker, first your turn. 'Mansoor in one strike he pushed the pink in hole. Hinayat shocked, he thought he can't strike. Mansoor started to desperately Unbuttoning his kurta turning to go into that room. But before he could move bullet shot in his head. It doesn't take a second to mansoor fell on ground while hinayat stood there with gunbin hand still pointing while the other two members moved back in sudden shock. Hinayat started taking off his kurta while moving into that room where his brother fazeer f#*ked a girl. His well built body could be seen with dark spots of previous wounds. He casually went in the room. Pulling the girl from under his brother who fell in unconscious. Grabbed her naked frame in his hands. While the other two gun men has blank look asif it is everyday doing. There is no surprise in their eyes. His brother fazeer didn't wake up with the high of alcohol so is he.

Finally, a quiet morning, no alarms or lectures. I got out of bed and pulled the curtains, letting the sunlight brighten my room. I picked up my phone and immediately saw it was 11 o'clock. Naomi would be here in about an hour. As I was going through my notifications, I noticed a missed call from Lisa. I smiled slightly - he probably wanted to talk. I went out on the terrace and sat down on one of the wooden chairs. My decision to contact her again was full of hesitation, but I just couldn't help but do it. I dialed her number and after a short time she answered.\"Hello?\" I heard her voice, which I missed very much.\"Hey...\", I smiled even though I knew he couldn't see me. I always felt good when we were together, even if it was just on the phone. \"You called me, but I was in the shower and didn't hear. What's going on? Is everything okay?\", Lisa spoke with such calmness and care that I couldn't even believe it. Despite everything, she was still interested in me. At first I thought she was just a fun girl who liked games, but as time went on I realized she was much more than that.\"Yes, everything is fine... Well, except... us. I just wanted to talk, I don't know why it seemed like a good idea. I don't want to lose you and I know what I did was wrong and hard to forgive, but I'm really sorry and I miss you a lot and I can't be mad at you, I don't like being mad at me. I'll find out if you need more time... or do you just want to end it all, but I don't want to just not talk and not know what's going on, what you think about all this.\"\"You think I'm mad at you for sleeping with Michael?\" she asked, her voice sounding completely different from the one I knew. \"What?!\"\"Don't you?\"\"I was angry, but in the end I can't really tell you anything because... we are not together.\"\"Then what's the problem?\" I asked, my heart pounding like crazy.\"That I want you and you want time. That we are jealous, we tease each other on purpose, every time we are together we can't refrain from... a kiss , we tell each other how much we love each other and we're almost together... but we're not. I just don't know how to be around you anymore, I can't pretend nothing is happening, it's been over 4 months,\"\"I know... i feel the same way,\" I said with hope in my voice. \"I just don't want to spoil everything. I'm not ready for everyone to know about us, I'm scared of people's reaction. I don't want us to be just another sensation .\"\"Then call me when you stop caring about the others, otherwise it's absolutely stupid to keep doing whatever it is.\"\"Are you going to give up that easily? I thought we were friends first and foremost, and for as long as I can remember you didn't mind giving me all the time I needed.\"\"And that's exactly what I'm going to do, give you time. Maybe I need that too,\" Lisa said, cutting the connection.Shit! Why was I so impatient? I had a feeling the conversation wasn't going to go well, but I wasn't prepared for what I heard. Now I have spoiled my mood again. I tried to hold back my tears and not give in to despair. Maybe it really wouldn't have worked out between us. It was... difficult.\"Honey?\" came my mother's voice and I immediately turned around. She stood on the terrace with a smile on her face.\"Yeah,\" I smiled weakly.\"Did something happen?\" he asked, approaching me.  I could never hide my emotions, especially in front of my mother.\"I talked to Lisa... and it didn't go very well.\"\"Are you still mad or did you get into another fight?\" she asked, looking at me with sympathy written all over her face.\"Don't be angry... and we didn't fight... we just have different opinions about our relationship, she wants us to be together... me too, but I'm scared of all the publicity our relationship will be subjected to, I don't know if I can handle it. She's used to it by now and it's not that big a problem for her.\"\"Do you love her?\"\"Yes,\" I said quietly. \"An awful lot.\"\"I know it's not an easy decision, but sweetheart, love requires sacrifice, think if you would make that sacrifice for her. If you really love her and think she is really the right person for you nothing else should matter. And know that whatever you choose will support you as long as it makes you happy, but it's all up to you. That's it with the girl talk, because it's time to spend some time with your best friend, who is currently waiting for you in the living room!\" the last part was said with great enthusiasm.\"Naomi's here?!\"I got up from my seat, and Mom just nodded. I smiled broadly and jogged inside. I ran downstairs, and Naomi came out of the living room.\"Jesus!\" I cried when I saw her. Naomi smiled widely and we hugged harder than ever.\"I can't believe I'm finally seeing you!\" she said happily.\"It's been forever!\", I replied and we laughed together. We sat like that for a little while and finally backed away.Lunch is in 10 minutes, girls,\" Mom said, coming down from upstairs. \"Vi, why don't you go change? You missed breakfast, at least you'll catch lunch,\" Mom joked.\"I'm going,\" I replied with a smile and then Naomi and I walked up to my room. I couldn't wait to spend the next two weeks with her. The only thing that bothers me is keeping Lisa a secret. It will definitely be a topic I won't be able to avoid. I just knew I wasn't ready to tell her. For now, I have to give it my all so I don't let myself down in front of her and have any gaffes like the one that Mel found out about."}

In a confused state, his mind felt numb and fuzzy, so he got up to investigate his surroundings.Ronan found himself standing in the midst of a vibrant and fantastical world.Confused and disoriented, he took in his surroundings. The sky above was a surreal blend of colours he'd never seen, and the ground beneath his feet felt springy, like walking on clouds. But what caught his attention were the inhabitants of this peculiar realm—anthropomorphic animals, or, as he soon discovered, furries.The furry creatures were bustling about, going about their day in a bustling marketplace filled with stalls selling fruits, colourful trinkets, and whimsical gadgets. They greeted each other with cheerful chirps, wagging tails, and vibrant fur of every imaginable hue.\"Uh, where am I?\" Ronan muttered to himself, still trying to make sense of the situation. He felt a tap on his shoulder and turned to find a friendly-looking fox with a top hat and monocle.\"Ah, you must be the newcomer! Welcome to Furrington! I'm , Jack Wise, your guide to this fantastical realm,\" the fox said, extending a paw for a handshake.Ronan hesitated but shook the paw. \"Furrington? Seriously?\"Jack Wise chuckled, \"Well, that's what the locals call it. Now, come along! We've got a lot to show you, and you might want to get a tail or some vibrant fur. It's the latest trend here!\"As Ronan followed Jack Wise through the lively streets of Furrington, he couldn't help but marvel at the eccentricity of this newfound world. Little did he know that his mundane Tuesday had taken an unexpected twist into an adventure filled with furry friends and fantastical wonders."}
