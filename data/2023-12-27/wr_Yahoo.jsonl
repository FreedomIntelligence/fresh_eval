That's why the Department of Energy (DOE) was jumping for joy when it discovered what is believed to be the world's largest supply of lithium beneath California's Salton Sea. The estimated 18 million-ton motherlode could be worth up to $540 billion and meet America's demand for decades to come.In the 1990s, lithium was perhaps most famous for being the title of a hit song by the band Nirvana. Fast forward 30 years, and Lithium has become famous as an indispensable element in the multibillion-dollar renewable energy industry. Lithium is a key component of the rechargeable batteries that power things like electric cars. Production of other important consumer products like cellular phones and solar energy panels also requires large amounts of lithium.Don't Miss:The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare?Airbnb was worth $47 billion at IPO. This startup is automating the trillion-dollar hospitality market.Without enough Lithium to power those batteries and other innovations, the world's effort to fight climate change through renewable energy will be hampered. In a recent report, high-ranking DOE official Jeff Marootian said, \"Lithium is vital to decarbonizing the economy and meeting President Biden's goals of 50% electric vehicle adoption by 2030.\" The problem with that is China currently dominates the global production of lithium.A global rival such as China controlling the world's supply of lithium runs counter to America's strategic and economic interests. That's why the DOE has been funding the exploration of lithium sources inside the United States. As part of that effort, it gave a $14.9 million grant to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Energy to study the area surrounding the Salton Sea, which straddles Riverside and Imperial counties in the California desert.California Gov. Gavin Newsome was touring the Salton Sea with President Joe Biden to tout America's renewable energy industry when he referred to the area as \"t \"the Saudi Arabia of lithium.\" If that sounds like an exaggeration, consider that the DOE estimates there is enough lithium beneath the Salton Sea to provide batteries for more than 375 million electric vehicles (EVs).Trending: The vodka market is set to soar at 5.6% CAGR to $40 billion by 2030. Join Lit Vodka’s journey for a piece of the premium spirits pie.The estimated 18 million tons of lithium would put America firmly in the lead in terms of supplying the global market. It could turbocharge EV and solar production and has the potential to give the United States an unprecedented level of energy independence.If the lithium beneath the Salton Sea can be harvested and brought to market, America would no longer have to rely on nations like Saudi Arabia and China for its energy or automaking needs. America would also be much richer because lithium is worth an estimated $29,000 per ton. That would make the Salton Sea's estimated 18 million gallons worth $540 billion.A partnership between the U.S. government and Buffett has the potential to increase America's production of lithium and profitability for the industry. That's why Berkshire Hathaway Energy is hard at work. The company operates 10 of the Salton Sea's geothermal power plants.It is not alone. EnergySource and Controlled Thermal Resources are also operating in the area. If America becomes the global leader in lithium production, it could lead to a boom of lithium-based businesses that could add billions or trillions of dollars per year to the U.S. economy.Read Next: What decision made this 20-year-old a millionaire in 1 year?Invest alongside Dwyane Wade and other sports icons.

The convergence of inflation, high interest rates and an unpredictable stock market has significantly impacted retirement plans. Despite a decrease in inflation, concerns about income keeping pace with rising costs persist. Questions about the adequacy of Social Security benefits add to the uncertainty.Social Security, often considered the bedrock of retirement income, offers limited relief. In 2023, the average Social Security retirement benefit was $1,827, which translates to $21,924 per year or $423 per week. This amount, though consistent, falls short of ensuring a comfortable retirement, especially when considering medical expenses.Don't Miss:The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare?Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you.It’s also important to consider that the amount of Social Security benefits you receive may vary. Benefits could be lower for those with less than 35 years of employment history, lower lifetime earnings or who opt for early benefits at age 62 instead of waiting for full retirement age or later for increased benefits.In 2022, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that the median annual income for Americans aged 65 and older, including sources like retirement accounts and Social Security, was $50,290. This amount falls short of the $74,580 median household income. The data also reveals a slight decline in senior income compared to 2020, highlighting an expanding financial disparity.The Bureau of Labor Statistics reveals that Americans aged 65 and older had an average annual expenditure of $57,818 in 2022, exceeding their median income. This discrepancy indicates a potential need for additional income sources or a return to the workforce, as evidenced by a Paychex study suggesting that about one-sixth of retired Americans consider resuming work.Financial advisers emphasize the importance of retirement planning beyond Social Security. They suggest exploring ways to optimize existing assets, reduce expenses or reenter the workforce. Despite financial challenges, many seniors find creative ways to enjoy fulfilling retirements on modest incomes.Retirement planning in the U.S. demands a comprehensive strategy, taking into account individual needs and lifestyle preferences.To ensure adequate savings for retirement, consider these steps:Calculate monthly needs: Estimate your monthly expenses in retirement, accounting for housing, healthcare, utilities, food and leisure activities. This will give you a clearer picture of the income required to maintain your desired lifestyle.Factor in inflation: Remember that the cost of living will likely increase over time because of inflation. Ensure your retirement plan accounts for this.Consider healthcare costs: Healthcare can be a significant expense in retirement. Plan for both regular medical costs and potential long-term care needs.Diversify income sources: Besides Social Security, consider other income sources like pensions, retirement accounts like 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and investments. Diversification can provide more stability and flexibility.Plan for longevity: People are living longer, so plan your finances to last for potentially 20 to 30 years or more post-retirement.Regular review and adjustments: Regularly review your retirement plan to ensure it stays aligned with your changing needs and economic conditions.Seek professional advice: A financial adviser can help tailor a retirement plan to your specific circumstances, considering factors like risk tolerance, investment preferences and retirement goals.\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?APPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis ReportTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis ReportThis article Average Retirement Income In America Revealed — Will You Make Enough Each Month? originally appeared on Benzinga.com© 2023 Benzinga.com.

{"date": "2023-12-27-22-29", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/tesla-makes-money-selling-electric-104500179.html", "text_blocks": "Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) sells more passenger electric vehicles (EVs) than any other car maker, and they account for 84% of the company's revenue today.However, seasoned technology investor Cathie Wood thinks Tesla stock is the biggest artificial intelligence (AI) opportunity in the world. The company is using AI to develop its industry-leading autonomous self-driving vehicle software.Wood's investment firm, Ark Investment Management, released a set of financial models that suggest electric vehicle sales won't be the primary source of Tesla's financial success for much longer. With the help of AI, 67% of the company's earnings will come from something else entirely by 2027! Here's what investors need to know.Tesla is on track to produce 1.8 million EVs in 2023, a number that CEO Elon Musk hopes will grow by 50% per year for the foreseeable future. The company operates six gigafactories located in California, Texas, Nevada, New York, Berlin (Germany), and Shanghai (China), with another in the planning stages in Nuevo Leon (Mexico).But Tesla will have to expand its footprint if it wants to maintain Musk's desired growth rate over the long term. He estimates the company will be operating up to 12 gigafactories around the world by 2030, with a production capacity of 20 million EVs per year.Reaching that point won't be easy, because competition is growing fast from start-ups and legacy automakers entering the EV space. Tesla has a significant head start, and it enjoys economies of scale -- its gross profit margin is higher than that of any other car maker in the industry, which affords the company pricing power to help fend off competitive threats.In fact, Tesla slashed the prices of its EVs by an average of 20% between August 2022 and August 2023. Car giants like General Motors and Ford have already announced plans to postpone billions of dollars in investments into their own EV businesses, as they realize they will have to sustain heavy losses to compete with Tesla in the near term. Right now, Ford loses about $36,000 on every EV it produces!But Tesla's price war is a huge drag on its own financials. While the company is on track to sell a record number of cars, its 2023 revenue is projected to grow by just 19% year over year -- the slowest annual pace in its history. The EV giant's earnings per share (profit) is set to shrink by 22%.Tesla has been developing its full self-driving (FSD) software for over 10 years. It's currently the most advanced in the industry; Musk says Tesla customers have driven over 300 million miles using the beta version so far, and data is king when developing any AI-based technology.Ark Invest also estimates Tesla has 2.7 million customer cars on the road testing FSD, which is 10 times more than its nearest competitor.Musk has told investors Tesla plans to launch a fully autonomous robotaxi -- with no pedals or steering wheel -- by 2024, which can seamlessly transport passengers with no human assistance. However, once FSD rolls out to all customers, any Tesla vehicle could become a robotaxi.Musk says the average passenger vehicle is only driven for 12 hours per week, so customers could lend their Tesla EVs to the company's ride-hailing network when they're not in use. That would allow the owner to earn income, which would be split with Tesla.Given the robotaxi hasn't launched yet, it's hard to say exactly what the business model will look like. However, we know Tesla will earn recurring subscription revenue from customers who install FSD software, and we also know Musk is considering licensing it to other car makers.Of course, sales of the robotaxi itself will drive revenue, and any customer-owned Tesla serving as a robotaxi in the company's ride-hailing network will also contribute revenue.By 2027, Ark Invest believes Tesla will be generating over $1 trillion in annual revenue, with 44% coming from the robotaxi business. That will translate into $354 billion in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), of which 64% will come from robotaxis and a further 3% from human-driven ride-hailing within Tesla's network.Assuming Ark is correct, that means 67% of Tesla's 2027 EBITDA will come from segments that don't even exist today.Tesla's revenue is on track to come in at $97 billion in 2023, so it would have to grow by 80% per year between now and 2027 to meet Ark's $1 trillion forecast by 2027. Keep in mind, Musk himself is only aiming for 50% EV production growth going forward.The big unknown is how quickly Tesla can scale its robotaxi and ride-hailing businesses. Uber Technologies has 142 million monthly customers on its ride-hailing platform, and that company is on track to generate just $37 billion in revenue this year. Plus, Uber recently launched a fully autonomous service in Arizona in partnership with Alphabet's Waymo, so Tesla already faces competition.I wouldn't place a sizable bet on Tesla stock based solely on Ark's financial models. They might prove accurate over time, but 2027 is an incredibly ambitious target.Nevertheless, if and when Ark's predictions come true, Tesla could amass a valuation of over $6 trillion! That implies a 770% upside in its stock from where it trades today.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

{"date": "2023-12-27-22-29", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/missed-nvidia-buy-magnificent-artificial-115247796.html", "text_blocks": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the hottest stocks on the market in 2023, with eye-popping gains of 235%. That impressive surge is justified thanks to the astronomic acceleration in the chipmaker's top and bottom lines on the back of booming demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips.However, the big pop in Nvidia stock this year inflated its valuation. It is now trading at 27 times sales, which is higher than its five-year average price-to-sales ratio of 20. The trailing earnings multiple stands at 65.While Nvidia seems capable of justifying that valuation thanks to its dominant position in the market for AI chips, which is likely to translate into terrific growth in 2024, investors may be looking for a cheaper alternative to capitalize on the proliferation of AI.Enter Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU). Shares of the memory specialist have shot up 74% this year, and its latest earnings report tells us that more upside is in the cards in 2024 thanks to AI. What's more, Micron stock is trading at a very attractive valuation despite its rally. Let's look at the reasons why buying this chipmaker is a no-brainer right now.Micron Technology released its fiscal 2024 first-quarter results (for the three months ended Nov. 30) on Dec. 20. The company's revenue jumped 16% year over year to $4.7 billion, exceeding its guidance of $4.4 billion and Wall Street's expectation of $4.58 billion.Micron reported a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) loss of $0.95 per share for the quarter. While that was higher than the year-ago period's loss of $0.04 per share, the figure was smaller than Micron's guidance of a loss of $1.07 per share. Analysts were expecting Micron to report a loss of $1.01 per share. However, the improving conditions in the memory market helped the chipmaker outperform expectations.The memory market was in dire straits earlier thanks to oversupply. Demand for memory chips fell as sales of smartphones and personal computers (PCs) dropped off a cliff, leaving memory manufacturers with excess supply that weighed on pricing. The good news is that Micron is now witnessing an \"improved supply demand environment in the current calendar quarter [that] gives us additional confidence in the trajectory of our business.\"CEO Sanjay Mehrotra added on the latest earnings conference call, \"We have driven a strong inflection in industry pricing this calendar quarter, which will allow us to benefit from higher prices earlier in our fiscal year compared to prior plans.\"Micron expects memory prices to grow at a faster pace than it was anticipating earlier. One of the reasons why that's the case is because the adoption of generative AI is driving stronger memory demand. Mehrotra says that Micron is \"in the very early stages of a multiyear growth phase catalyzed and driven by generative AI,\" and the company is \"already seeing strong demand driven by early deployment of AI solutions, which will only accelerate over time.\"Micron sees AI creating the demand for more memory, not only in servers but also due to the deployment of this technology in smartphones and PCs. That's not surprising, as PC manufacturers are already betting on AI to be the next big growth driver for this market, while tech giants are reportedly working to bring generative AI to smartphones.All this explains why Micron is anticipating its key business segments to grow in the current fiscal year. In the data center business, for instance, Micron is forecasting server shipments to increase in the mid-single digits in 2024 following a double-digit decline in 2023. More importantly, the company's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips are in the final stages of qualification for deployment in Nvidia's H200 and Grace Hopper GH200 chip platforms, which are set to hit the market in 2024.As a result, Micron management is confident of generating several hundred million in HBM revenue in fiscal 2024, followed by another year of growth in 2025. With the demand for HBM set to grow rapidly in the long run, Micron could win big by supplying its chips to Nvidia, considering that the latter is looking to substantially increase its production in 2024 thanks to the arrival of its new AI chip platforms.Similarly, Micron is forecasting growth in both the PC and the smartphone markets in 2024 following sharp declines last year. Management also points out that the ramp-up of AI-enabled PCs in the second half of 2024 is likely to increase its addressable market to the tune of 4GB (gigabytes) to 8GB of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) per unit. Counterpoint Research estimates that shipments of AI-powered PCs could increase at an annual rate of 50% through 2030, and this should further contribute to strong memory demand in the long run.So it's not surprising to see why the memory market's revenue is expected to jump a healthy 45% in 2024 to $130 billion, according to market research firm IDC. This robust end-market growth is the reason why Micron's financial performance is anticipated to improve sharply next year.Micron's guidance for the current quarter suggests that its growth is set to accelerate. The company is forecasting $5.3 billion in revenue in the current quarter, which would translate into a year-over-year jump of 43%. Additionally, the chipmaker expects its adjusted net loss to drop to $0.28 per share from $1.91 per share in the prior-year period.Though Micron hasn't issued a full-year revenue forecast, analysts are expecting its top line to jump nearly 48% in fiscal 2024 to $23 billion, followed by another year of robust growth in fiscal 2025.Assuming the company does hit $23 billion in revenue in the ongoing fiscal year, which it seems capable of doing, its market cap could jump to $138 billion based on its current sales multiple of 6. That would represent a 45% upside from current levels. And Micron's price-to-sales ratio is much lower than Nvidia's, so it won't be surprising to see the market reward it with a higher multiple thanks to its AI-fueled growth.That could lead to a stronger jump in Micron's shares, which is why investors looking to buy a fast-growing AI stock at an affordable valuation should consider buying it hand over fist right now.Should you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Micron Technology wasn't one of them.

In a recent TikTok video, Cardone revealed his strategy of “going broke” twice a year to reduce taxable income.“Two times a year I go broke because you don’t want a bunch of this sitting around (showing a stack of cash) because it gets taxed,” said Cardone, who has reported net worth of $600 million.He told viewers he purchased two helicopters, each costing between $10 and $12 million, as a way to manage large sums of money and reduce taxes.“The tax bill is the No. 1 greatest expense, any family has,\" he said. \"It is the I the R and the S.”His statement highlights the burden that taxes can impose, particularly on families trying to manage their finances effectively in the current economy.Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here are 3 high-yield investments to add significant income to your portfolio.Cardone’s success is rooted in his strategic investments in real estate, particularly in multifamily complexes, and in establishing diverse income streams through businesses like Cardone Capital and Cardone Training Technologies. His background in sales has been pivotal in securing lucrative opportunities and partnerships. Cardone is known for his strong networking skills and continuous learning, which keep him at the forefront of his field.His work ethic and his willingness to take calculated risks have been significant factors in his financial growth. Cardone has also built a strong personal brand and effectively uses technology to expand his reach and influence.Cardone’s method of “going broke” by investing in high-value assets like helicopters is an unconventional approach to managing wealth and reducing tax liabilities. His strategy involves converting liquid assets, which are subject to taxation, into investments that not only have the potential for appreciation but also offer tax advantages.Entrepreneurs like Cardone often use various methods to write off expenses to reduce their taxable income. For instance, when purchasing buildings, entrepreneurs can leverage tax advantages such as depreciation, allowing them to write off the cost of the property over time. This strategy can significantly reduce taxable income, as it considers the building’s gradual decrease in value as an expense. Costs related to the maintenance and improvement of the property can also be deducted, further reducing the tax liability.Elon Musk has reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land just outside of Austin.

In this scenario, the ideal candidate would be a company that itself is a mosaic of diverse ventures and innovations. One titan of e-commerce and cloud computing strikes me as a perfect pick for a single-name portfolio. This household name has its fingers in multiple pies, from artificial intelligence (AI) to groceries, making it a microcosm of the consumer and tech markets.Of course, I'm talking about Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Stay tuned to take a closer look at this jack-of-all-trades, exploring a company that has become synonymous with both innovation and reliability.At the core of Amazon's robust financial health lies its e-commerce segment, the business engine driving a staggering 84% of its total revenue in the third quarter of 2023. This overwhelming share underscores not just Amazon's dominance in online retail, but also its profound influence on consumer habits globally.The company's strategies for growth, customer engagement, and innovation in e-commerce paint a picture of a business that is much more than just an online marketplace. Understanding this segment is key to grasping Amazon's overall market strategy and its potential trajectory in the coming years.The profit margins in Amazon's retail operations have always been paper-thin. Even in the holiday quarter of 2020 -- the golden age of coronavirus-driven sales growth -- the operating margins stopped at 3.7% for the North American segment and 1% in international e-commerce. The financial profits dove deep into the red ink even then if you included the $9 billion of additional capital expenses to support Amazon's infrastructure and overnight delivery system. This business isn't cheap to run.But Amazon wouldn't be Amazon without its online marketplace, and this division remains crucial to the company's long-term prospects.The sheer volume of Amazon's sales allows it to benefit from economies of scale. This means that as the company produces or sells more, the cost per unit of production, distribution, or selling decreases. Very few companies can match Amazon's massive heft, giving the company an important and hard-to-copy competitive advantage.High sales volumes contribute significantly to Amazon's brand value and customer loyalty.The large number of transactions on Amazon's platform generates vast amounts of data. Analyzing this digital treasure trove helps Amazon understand consumer behavior, preferences, and trends.Amazon's diverse range of services and products creates numerous cross-selling opportunities. For instance, a customer purchasing a book might be shown advertisements for Amazon's Kindle service or Prime membership. This strategy not only boosts sales in other departments but also enhances customer engagement with the larger brand.Amazon's market dominance gives it substantial negotiating power with suppliers and partners. This can lead to better deals, exclusive products, or favorable terms, further strengthening its market position.So Amazon's e-commerce margins may be slim or even negative, as they were in the recent third-quarter report, but this division still serves many useful purposes. Besides, every retailer faces similar margin pressures. For instance, Costco's (NASDAQ: COST) operating margin would have stopped at 1.6% in the most recent quarter if it didn't run a highly profitable membership program. Walmart's (NYSE: WMT) most recent operating margin in the U.S. retail segment landed at 3.9% -- hardly a river of gold. In all cases, massive selling volumes make up for the minuscule margins, and Amazon enhances its bottom-line income with the qualities listed above.While Amazon's e-commerce segment may grab most of the spotlight, it's the Amazon Web Services (AWS) division that often steals the show in financial reports.AWS, a pioneering leader in cloud computing, has become a linchpin in Amazon's diversified business model, contributing significantly to its profit margins. In fact, AWS routinely delivers larger operating profits than the total retail operations, despite a much smaller revenue stream. In Q3, for instance, AWS saw $7 billion in segment-level operations while the two retail sections added up to $4.2 billion.AWS is more than a general-purpose computing platform. The cloud computing service is also a premium provider of specialized computing capacity in exciting fields such as AI and quantum computing. Amazon resells tools and services created by other companies, and also delivers cutting-edge research and product development of its own.Amazon's platform holds a global share of 32% in the cloud computing market, ahead of runner-up Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure and bronze medalist Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Cloud. This trio collected a combined $45 billion of this sector's $68 billion revenue opportunity in the third quarter.Amazon's evolution from a humble online bookstore to a global powerhouse encapsulates its dynamic growth and strategic vision. The sector-spanning titan that Jeff Bezos built offers a blend of e-commerce, AWS, and ventures into new technologies. Together, these ideas offer a unique mix of stability and innovation.In a market full of tempting choices, Amazon stands as the holistic investment option above all others, making it the ideal single stock for a forward-thinking portfolio.Mind you, I would still prefer to build a diverse portfolio of at least 20 stocks around the Amazon cornerstone, but thought experiments like this one can be helpful and interesting.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

{"date": "2023-12-27-22-29", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/im-65-years-old-750k-122659587.html", "text_blocks": "If you’re 65 years old and collecting Social Security, you may wonder if it’s too late to convert your $750,000 traditional IRA into a Roth IRA. The short answer is no – there are no legal restrictions to Roth conversion based on age or income. Practically, however, the decision involves carefully weighing tax implications, healthcare costs, estate planning and more. Spreading conversions over multiple years often makes the most financial sense for larger IRAs. Guidance from a financial advisor can help you weigh the costs of a Roth conversion in your circumstances.A Roth IRA conversion involves moving funds from a traditional, pre-tax IRA into an after-tax Roth IRA account. You pay income tax on the money that gets converted now, but future withdrawals in retirement come out tax-free.Plus, traditional IRAs are subject to required minimum distributions (RMDs) starting at age 73. This can lead to higher taxes in retirement as RMD income, which is treated as ordinary taxable income, can push retirees into higher tax brackets. But RMD rules don’t apply to Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s, so you can leave the money in the account or withdraw it any time you need it without owing any taxes on your contributions (you may owe income taxes on investment earnings if you withdraw them less than five years after making your initial contribution).If you need additional help navigating the rules surrounding Roth IRAs, consider speaking with a financial advisor.The sooner you convert funds from your traditional pre-tax IRA to a Roth account, the more years of tax-free growth you'll enjoy in your Roth account. And you'll be able to withdraw those Roth funds without owing any taxes.But you will have to pay taxes on the conversion, which is no small consideration when it comes to timing. Converting a large IRA can require you to pay the top marginal tax rate of 37% on most or even all of the entire conversion amount, depending on your other income, deductions and additional factors.If you convert it gradually, however, you can spread the income bump out over several years and avoid subjecting it to the top marginal tax rate. This can help reduce the tax owed each year and overall.It’s also important to consider when you’ll need to withdraw funds from your Roth IRA. Funds can’t be withdrawn without penalty within five years of the conversion. And, if you convert your IRA to a Roth gradually over time, those conversions each retrigger the five-year rule for that portion of the money.Meeting with a financial advisor can provide clarity on complex moves like Roth conversions.A major concern in converting a $750,000 IRA balance at once would be the significant tax bill that would accompany such a transaction. Completely a Roth conversion of that size would push the person into the 37% marginal tax bracket.If you’re a single filer and your Social Security income isn’t high enough to be taxed, adding $750,000 to your current income could trigger about $238,000 in extra taxes, using the 2023 tax brackets. Going slowly with $75,000 converted per year over 10 years reduces the tax hit each year by keeping your taxable income in the 22% bracket.Here's how those scenarios might play out, assuming you are a single filer and your Social Security income is less than $25,000 so escapes taxation:Size of Roth conversion: $750,000Tax bracket: 37%Total Federal income tax owed: $237,831This option leaves you with a massive tax bill but around $512,000 in your new Roth IRA, which you’ll eventually be able to withdraw tax-free.Size of Roth conversion: $75,000 (x10)Tax bracket: 22%Total Federal income tax owed: $88,000 over 10 yearsKeep in mind that funds left in your IRA will continue to grow while you're executing these annual conversions, so the IRA likely won't be empty by the time you have to start taking RMDs. However, the RMDs you'll have to take by then will be much smaller so won't incur nearly as much taxation compared to leaving the money in a traditional IRA.A third option is to leave the money unconverted in your IRA and start taking RMDs once you turn 73, paying taxes on them as you go. However, this could leave you paying higher taxes in retirement until your death. But if you need more help taking stock of your different options, this free matching tool can pair you with a fiduciary advisor.You may not find that one course of action is clearly superior. Factors to consider when deciding if and how much Roth conversion makes sense:Compare current vs. future income tax ratesAccount for RMDs and estate plansWeigh healthcare and other senior costsAssess tax impact on heirsModel multi-year scenariosStrategic partial Roth conversions tailored to your situation may provide the most tax advantages for people with large IRA balances.One major limitation to Roth conversions is that they cannot be reversed. If tax rates decline later or you need converted funds sooner, you could regret having locked in taxes now at a higher rate. Inheritance plans may also change. Do a thorough multi-year analysis before committing to convert.Run your own Roth conversion scenarios first or enlist the help of a financial advisor to help you make these important calculations.At 65 or any age, while parts of your retirement finances remain unsettled, limiting Roth conversions to small chunks spread over years offers flexibility. This balances immediate tax costs against future tax savings for you and your heirs. As with most money moves in retirement, prudently assessing your multi-year tax picture first is key.Instead of guessing if converting your IRA makes sense, talk to a financial advisor who can crunch the numbers. Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be hard. SmartAsset's free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If you're ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.Keep in mind that there are income limitations for contributing to a Roth IRA. In 2024, the IRS doesn’t permit single filers with an adjusted gross income (AGI) above $87,000 and married couples who file jointly with an AGI above $240,000. However, backdoor Roth IRAs can help high earners legally circumvent these income limits.Photo credit: ©iStock.com/zimmytws, ©iStock.com/Panupong Piewkleng, ©iStock.com/kate_sept2004The post I'm 65 Years Old With $750k in an IRA.

{"date": "2023-12-27-22-29", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/4-reasons-buy-coca-cola-143000410.html", "text_blocks": "You might be a regular customer of Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), but are you a shareholder as well? If so, you know at least one of the several reasons to own it. If not, here's a rundown of the top four reasons (in no particular order) you might want to become a shareholder sooner rather than later.The stock's forward-looking dividend yield of 3.2% is respectable but far from jaw-dropping. You can certainly find higher-yielding stocks.Look beyond the current yield, though. Coca-Cola has paid dividends like clockwork for decades and has raised its payment every year for the past 61 years. And it looks like there's no end in sight for these increases.These aren't pittance improvements, either. The dividend is about twice as big as it was in 2015, and four times what it was 15 years ago. That growth has easily outpaced inflation during that time.The healthy dividend only matters if it can be sustained, and that's not apt to be a problem for this company. It's been built and then rebuilt to generate cash in all environments.As a consumer, you might see Coca-Cola as a beverage company. It's not exactly the bottling company it appears to be, though, but actually a licensor of brand names and flavors, collecting royalties on the products that bottlers manufacture and then sell through distribution channels.The company's role is largely one of marketing and advertising its products. This translates into less revenue, but ultimately a bigger bottom line because the royalty business has much higher margins than bottling.It's also more consistent and predictable revenue since the bottlers take on most of the risk and burden of rising costs, as we've seen since 2022.And the company is very, very good at marketing -- so good that describing Coca-Cola's advertising efforts as mere marketing doesn't do them justice. The company is also incredible at branding, which is more about making its beverages part of a lifestyle than simply prompting the purchase of some drinks.Consider this: It's been more than 50 years since it first aired, but consumers who were around at the time still remember the I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing jingle written specifically for a series of Coca-Cola television commercials.And the company isn't just its namesake cola. It has a wide array of beverage brands in its lineup, including Fresca, Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks to name a few. While none of them are as big as the Coca-Cola line itself, the company is certainly creating similar success with these other drinks using similar promotional approaches.As a bonus, the company's wide range of products not only gives its salespeople leverage with retailers, but also gives the company something to promote to a wider range of consumers who are increasingly steering away from sugary sodas.Last but not least, consider adding a stake in Coca-Cola soon because the stock is relatively cheap right now.It's priced at more than 20 times its trailing and projected per-share profits, so not every investor will agree with this argument. But the stock is persistently priced at such a valuation, and the market's willing to support this premium because veteran investors know they must pay up for quality. It's well worth it, in fact.Indeed, it may be more than worth it right now. Despite Coca-Cola's continued revenue and earnings growth during this time, the stock is trading right where it was in early 2020 when the pandemic took hold of the world; since then, investors have favored growth stocks over value stocks like Coca-Cola.With the economy changing now, however, the backdrop is evolving in a way that could favor value over growth again for a while. Don't be surprised to see this particular ticker finally break its dry spell and get moving again in 2024.Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coca-Cola wasn't one of them.

{"date": "2023-12-27-22-29", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/meet-stock-split-stock-warren-100600829.html", "text_blocks": "When the going gets tough on Wall Street, professional and everyday investors have a tendency to seek out profitable, time-tested, industry-leading businesses to lead them through the storm.For the past decade, the FAANG stocks have been a staple for investors looking for consistency and outperformance. But over the past two years and change, stocks enacting splits are the ones that have delivered the bacon for investors.A stock split is an event that allows a publicly traded company to cosmetically alter its share price and outstanding share count while having no impact on its market cap or operating performance. A forward-stock split is designed to make a company's shares more nominally affordable for retail investors. Meanwhile, reverse-stock splits ensure a company's share price meets the requirements for continued listing on a major exchange.Most investors hone in on companies enacting forward splits. That's because businesses conducting forward-stock splits are typically highfliers that are out-executing and out-innovating their competition.Since the midpoint of 2021, nine top-tier stocks have enacted stock splits:Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA): 4-for-1 splitAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN): 20-for-1 splitDexCom (NASDAQ: DXCM): 4-for-1 splitShopify (NYSE: SHOP): 10-for-1 splitAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 20-for-1 splitTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA): 3-for-1 splitPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW): 3-for-1 splitMonster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST): 2-for-1 splitNovo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO): 2-for-1 splitEven Wall Street's most-revered investor, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett, has north of $1.5 billion currently invested in a prominent stock-split stock. I'm talking about e-commerce kingpin Amazon, which has been a continuous holding since the first quarter of 2019.Typically, high-flying outperformers sport hefty valuation premiums. Many of the nine stock-split stocks listed here trade at aggressive earnings multiples, and would thus be off the radar of the traditionally value-focused Warren Buffett. It's why electric-vehicle maker Tesla, cloud-based e-commerce platform Shopify, and continuous glucose monitoring company DexCom, which respectively sport forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 66, 74, and 71, have no chance of being purchased by the Oracle of Omaha.There is, however, one stock-split stock that's historically inexpensive and makes for the likeliest addition to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio in 2024 by Warren Buffett and/or his investing lieutenants, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.The superstar stock in question that the Oracle of Omaha would be likeliest to buy in the new year is Alphabet, the parent company of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and a host of other ventures.Even though Berkshire Hathaway has never owned shares of Alphabet, Buffett has previously expressed regret for not taking the plunge. During Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in 2017, Buffett admitted that not understanding the value proposition of companies like Alphabet and Amazon a long time ago was a costly mistake.But after more than 19 years as a publicly traded company, Alphabet checks all the boxes Warren Buffett and his investing aides would look for when putting Berkshire Hathaway's enormous cash pile to work.Most notably, Alphabet's moat in internet search looks to be impenetrable. Data from GlobalStats shows that Google accounted for an astonishing 91.54% of worldwide search share in November. You'd have to go back to March 2015 to find the last month that Google didn't tally at least 90% of global monthly search share.Having a virtual monopoly in internet search makes Google the undisputed go-to for advertisers looking to target consumers with their message(s). It also affords Alphabet's subsidiary plenty of ad-pricing power.Even though the Oracle of Omaha isn't the most tech-savvy investor, Buffett understands consumer habits very well. YouTube is attracting more than 2.7 billion monthly active users each month, and has seen daily viewership for Shorts (short-form videos often lasting less than 60 seconds) jump from 6.5 billion to more than 50 billion since 2021. Like Google, YouTube is commanding exceptional ad-pricing power.It should be noted that Warren Buffett, Todd Combs, and Ted Weschler aren't afraid to invest in ad-driven businesses. This dynamic trio has overseen the steady increase of Berkshire's stake in media stock Paramount Global over the past two years. Buffett and his team fully understand that while recessions are an inevitable part of the economic cycle, periods of expansion last substantially longer. Buying into historically dominant, cyclical, ad-driven businesses can be a winning formula for long-term investors.The Oracle of Omaha and his team also are big fans of companies that reward patient investors. Although Alphabet doesn't offer a dividend -- it makes no sense for the company to pay a dividend when it's aggressively reinvesting in high-growth initiatives, such as Google Cloud -- it does have one of Wall Street's most-impressive capital-return programs.In April, the company's board authorized $70 billion in share repurchases. Since this decade began, Alphabet has bought back $186 billion worth of its common stock. These buybacks are increasing Alphabet's earnings per share, which is making an already fundamentally attractive stock that much more palatable for value seekers.Lastly, the valuation makes sense with Alphabet. Thanks to the guidance of the late, great Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett and his investing team have developed an appreciation for buying wonderful businesses at a fair price.Alphabet is currently trading for 21 times forward-year earnings, right on par with the forward P/E ratio of the benchmark S&P 500. What the S&P 500 doesn't have is Alphabet's expected annualized earnings growth of 19.5% over the next five years. Alphabet is also trading at its lowest multiple to forward cash flow since going public in 2004.If there's a stock-split stock Warren Buffett and his team are primed to buy in 2024, it's unquestionably Alphabet.Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

{"date": "2023-12-27-22-29", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/3-growth-stocks-expected-skyrocket-100600514.html", "text_blocks": "In less than a week, Wall Street will turn the page on what's been a stellar year for optimists. The 30-component Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to a record high, while the growth-driven Nasdaq Composite has surged 43% year to date, as of the closing bell on Dec. 22.Though a lot of credit for this rally goes to the \"Magnificent Seven,\" it was an overall strong year for growth stocks. The U.S. economy continuing to chug along, coupled with the prospect of the Federal Reserve reducing interest rates in 2024, has investors incredibly bullish on fast-paced companies as a whole.But no two growth stocks are cut from the same cloth. Based on the consensus price targets of Wall Street analysts, three growth stocks are expected to skyrocket in 2024.The first supercharged growth stock that Wall Street, collectively, sees rising by triple digits in the new year is hydrogen fuel-cell solutions company Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG). Wall Street's consensus price target of $9.13 per share implies that Plug's stock could gain 102% in 2024.Plug Power optimists are counting on a continued shift to renewable energy sources by developed countries. In an effort to reduce their carbon footprints, the world's largest economies are promoting greener transportation. The expectation is for hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, along with green hydrogen infrastructure, to be part of that equation.Aside from landing a green hydrogen deal in 2022 with e-commerce and logistics juggernaut Amazon, Plug's biggest wins came in early 2021. It received an equity investment from SK Group, as well as forged a joint venture with French automaker Renault. The partnership with SK Group will focus on bringing hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles and infrastructure to Asian markets, while the joint venture with Renault will tackle Europe's light commercial vehicle market.Unfortunately, Plug Power's attempts to rapidly expand its green hydrogen ecosystem are costing a pretty penny. Although the company's sales growth is topping 50% on an annual basis, its cost of revenue is growing at an even faster pace. Through the first nine months of 2023, Plug reported a net loss of more than $726 million.To build on this point, Plug Power made clear when it reported its third-quarter operating results that it's going to need additional capital. A \"going concern\" warning was also included in the company's financial statements, which suggests it doesn't have adequate capital on hand to cover its liabilities over the next 12 months.Another problem for Plug Power's shareholders is the company's dilutive money-raising efforts. Five years ago, Plug Power had approximately 219 million shares outstanding. As of Sept. 30, 2023, the company had more than 624 million shares outstanding. Ongoing dilution to pay for the company's aggressive expansion efforts is doing shareholders no favor. It's also a big reason a $9.13 price target seems unachievable in 2024.A second growth stock expected to skyrocket in 2024, based on the collective forecast of Wall Street analysts, is small-cap biotech company Lexicon Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: LXRX). Lexicon shares closed out Dec. 22 at $1.31. However, Wall Street's consensus one-year price target suggests they'll head to $5.15, which represents upside of 293%!Two factors look to be fueling this incredibly optimistic price target: the launch of Inpefa and the ongoing development of LX9211.In May, Lexicon earned its first true win when Inpefa (scientifically known as sotagliflozin) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment to reduce heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and other cardiovascular risk factors. Sotagliflozin was previously rejected in 2019 by the FDA as a treatment for patients with type 1 diabetes.Inpefa is unique in that it's the first-approved SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibitor. Whereas a handful of SGLT2 inhibitors, which block glucose absorption in the kidneys, have found their way onto pharmacy shelves, a dual inhibitor (SGLT1 blocks glucose absorption in the intestines) hadn't been approved until now. Although peak sales estimates vary, Inpefa is expected to ramp from around $4 million in sales in 2023 to potentially north of $500 million annually by 2028.The other source of excitement is the late-stage development of LX9211, an AAK1 inhibitor that's attempting to become the first non-opioid therapy for diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain in more than two decades. On Nov. 30, Lexicon enrolled its first patient in the phase 2b study that could expand the company's product portfolio beyond Inpefa.Similar to Plug Power, the biggest risk for Lexicon shareholders looks to be the prospect of dilution. Although Lexicon raised $143.7 million in gross proceeds by selling stock in June, operating losses are liable to continue as the company ramps up its marketing and branding efforts.While I'm not convinced Lexicon has a shot at hitting $5 per share in 2024, a triple-digit percentage gain on the heels of Inpefa's launch does seem doable in the new year.The third growth stock expected to skyrocket in 2024, according to Wall Street, is clinical-stage biotech company Cassava Sciences (NASDAQ: SAVA). Though shares ended the previous week at $23.94, Wall Street's consensus price target for the company chimes in at a cool $99.50. For those of you keeping score at home, this represents upside potential of 316% in the new year.Cassava Sciences first put itself on the map in 2021 when it released an interim analysis of its open-label phase 2b study involving simufilam for patients with Alzheimer's disease. The first 50 people dosed with simufilam demonstrated mean improvements in cognition scores, as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, at the six-, nine-, and 12-month mark. Considering how few drugs have been successful improving the quality of life for Alzheimer's patients, optimists flocked to Cassava.The company is currently in the midst of a randomized, 1900-patient, phase 3 trial with simufilam that's expected to yield top-line 52-week results toward the end of 2024, with top-line 76-week results announced by mid-2025. With $142.4 million in cash and cash equivalents available as of Sept. 30, it would appear that Cassava has enough capital, and access to capital, to see this extensive trial through to completion.On the other hand, Cassava Sciences has faced serious allegations that its trials are flawed. In particular, an investigative report by the City University of New York (CUNY) found that an associate professor at CUNY's school of medicine may have deliberately falsified scientific findings in 14 out of 31 allegations. Though Cassava Sciences management team has repeatedly blamed short-sellers for pushing its stock lower, any validity to these allegations would be highly detrimental to the company and its only developed experimental therapy.To add fuel to the fire, investors have witnessed a number of success stories when it comes to treating Alzheimer's in phase 2 clinical trials only to see these same companies fall flat in expanded phase 3 studies. Historically, few late-stage indications have a poorer success rate than Alzheimer's.While it'd be great to see Alzheimer's drugs succeed, it's far more realistic to expect Cassava Sciences to fall well short of Wall Street's lofty price target.Should you invest $1,000 in Plug Power right now?Before you buy stock in Plug Power, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Plug Power wasn't one of them.

The company's chief rival Nvidia (NVDA) has seen its stock cool a bit after a blistering year, logging a 5.3% advance on the month, while AMD (AMD) shares have jumped 18%.Shares of Intel are up 91% year to date. In 2022, the stock plunged 48% amid a series of quarterly disappointments and product setbacks.Despite the impressive price appreciation, Intel's market cap is still well short of that of its main competitors, which investors continue to view as ahead in the AI chips race.Intel's market cap currently stands at $212 billion, below AMD's $231.7 billion and Nvidia's $1.22 trillion, per Yahoo Finance comparison analysis.At this point, Intel's shareholders will likely take the gains following several years of product delays and deep restructurings.The company's strong December showing in the market reflects a few factors.On Tuesday, Israel's government awarded Intel a $3.2 billion grant for a $25 billion chip plant it intends to construct in southern Israel. The investment — part of CEO Pat Gelsinger's efforts to build new plants to produce chips for other semiconductor players — is reportedly the largest ever by a company in Israel.Intel currently employs 11,700 people in Israel. The company says it has invested more than $50 billion in the country over the last 50 years.Meanwhile, Intel is fresh off some good product news for a change.A week ago, Intel showcased a range of AI-focused products and services. On display was Gaudi3, an artificial intelligence chip for generative AI software. The chip will officially launch next year.Intel also showed off its Core Ultra processor, which will target the emerging AI PC market.The Street is hopeful the new chips will drive stronger sales and profits in 2024 amid the AI boom.\"The team is in a unique position to help unlock AI technology/capabilities across the different end devices given its broad compute product portfolio, software solutions, extensive ecosystem, and R&D scale,\" JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur said in a client note.Gelsinger told Yahoo Finance Live he is ramping up production of these new chips like \"crazy\" (see video above) to be the dominant player in artificial intelligence.\"Only a couple of companies in the world can do this, and only one in the Western world and that's Intel. So with that, we see a lot of market value creation yet in front of us. We're still well undervalued compared to many peers, even as we've made good progress this year.\" Gelsinger added. \"So I see a lot of opportunities for us to create value for our customers, to create value for our shareholders.\"Investors appear to be betting on just that.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

{"date": "2023-12-27-22-29", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/3-phenomenal-high-yield-dividend-103700259.html", "text_blocks": "Stock market trends come and go, but there's one currently popular strategy for everyday investors who want to secure a stream of passive income that never goes out of style. Buying dividend-paying stocks and holding them for long periods is still an easy and effective way to realize market-beating gains.Investing in companies that have profits to distribute is a proven strategy. During the 50 years from 1973 through 2022, dividend-paying stocks in the S&P 500 delivered an average annual return of 9.18% compared to just 3.95% for companies in the same benchmark index that didn't offer a dividend.These three dividend payers offer a rare combination of high yields upfront combined with a strong chance to see their payouts rise in the years ahead. Here's how adding them to your portfolio in 2024 could lead to steady payments that keep rising throughout your retirement years.Ever since the Great Recession, America's largest banks mostly stopped lending to middle-market companies regardless of their ability to generate cash and make interest payments. As a result, heaps of capital-starved companies with between $10 million and $1 billion in annual revenue are eager to accept relatively high-interest loans from business development companies (BDCs) like Ares Capital (NASDAQ: ARCC).In the third quarter, 69% of Ares Capital's portfolio was earning interest at floating rates that grew significantly. The average yield on total investments at cost rose to 11.2% in Q3 from 9.6% a year earlier.Ares Capital stock offers a huge 9.7% dividend yield at recent prices. It hasn't risen in a straight line, but the payout is up 14% over the past five years.After 19 years of operation, Ares Capital has worked with thousands of businesses and hundreds of private equity sponsors. There are so many middle-market companies trying to borrow money that well-established BDCs like Ares Capital can pick and choose non-cyclical businesses likely to repay their debts regardless of the overall economy.Around 23% of Ares Capital's diverse portfolio is invested in the software and services industry; its next largest concentration is in healthcare services at just 11% of the portfolio. Such diversification has helped the BDC report industry-leading loss rates since its inception in 2004 and will likely allow it to keep meeting its dividend commitments for many years to come.PennantPark Floating Rate Capital (NYSE: PFLT) is another BDC that offers an eye-popping dividend yield. At recent prices, it offers a 10.3% yield, and it distributes payments every month.A monthly payout isn't the only thing that sets PennantPark Floating Rate Capital apart from Ares Capital. As its name implies, nearly all the loans in PennantPark's portfolio collect interest at floating rates. The average yield it received on debt investments during its fiscal Q4 that ended Sep. 30 surged to 12.6% from 10% in the previous-year period.PennantPark's track record isn't as long as Ares Capital's, but it looks pretty good so far. Its dividend payout dipped briefly in 2018, but it's up 13.9% since the company initiated a dividend program in 2014.Investors can take heart in the company's performance during the ongoing economic slowdown brought about by higher interest rates. Just three portfolio companies representing 0.9% of the portfolio at cost were on non-accrual status at the end of September.Realty Income (NYSE: O) is another stock for investors who appreciate a monthly dividend and steady raises. This net-lease real estate investment trust (REIT) recently raised its monthly payout for the 105th consecutive quarter.With 13,282 commercial properties in its portfolio, Realty Income was already one of the world's largest net-lease REITs. A pending acquisition of Spirit Realty Capital for about $9.3 billion will add about 2,000 U.S. properties when the deal is completed, most likely during Q1 2024.Shares of Realty Income offer a 5.4% yield at recent prices. The REIT has raised its payout by 16% over the past five years. The years ahead could be even better with the addition of Spirit's portfolio, which was 99.6% occupied at the end of September.Realty Income's enormous size will allow it to pull off an all-stock acquisition of Spirit Realty and keep growing its payout. This REIT's reputation among lenders is so positive that it has an A3 rating from Moody's, which gives it a cost advantage that smaller REITs can only hope for. Put it together and this looks like a terrific stock to add to your portfolio now and hold over the long run.Should you invest $1,000 in Ares Capital right now?Before you buy stock in Ares Capital, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Ares Capital wasn't one of them.

I have about $750,000 and I’m planning to take about $1,700 per month. I already have a pension of about $1,500 per month.–LynneWaiting to file for Social Security in order to take advantage of the delayed credits is a good strategy for those who want to maximize their benefits. If you retire before you start claiming your benefits, you'll need a source of income to bridge the gap between the time your paychecks stop and when your Social Security begins.If you have a sufficient balance, then yes, withdrawing from your savings is a perfectly viable option to consider. However, that doesn't necessarily mean it’s the best choice for you. There's often more than one way to accomplish a goal and you need to consider your own preferences and concerns. (And if you need more help with important financial decisions in retirement, consider working with a financial advisor.)As you know, your Social Security checks will be higher the longer you wait to claim them up until age 70. The flip side is they’ll be worth less if you claim them before reaching your full retirement age (FRA).If you were born in 1960 or later, you’ll receive your full benefit at age 67. If you file for Social Security before reaching FRA, your benefit is reduced by a certain percentage for every month before you turn 67, up to a maximum reduction of 30% at age 62. However, each month you wait increases your eventual benefit up to a maximum of 24% at age 70.To illustrate the difference, let's assume your benefit will be $2,000 per month at age 67. If you choose to claim your benefit at age 62, you’ll only receive $1,400 per month (30% less). On the other hand, waiting until age 70 will boost your payment to $2,480 per month. That's a big difference and it often makes a lot of sense to wait. (And if you need more help planning for Social Security, consider matching with a financial advisor.)Of course, if you retire at 62 and wait another eight years to collect Social Security, you'll need a way to cover your expenses until you turn 70. Your 401(k) is a natural place to look since retirement income is exactly what it's for. But withdrawing more from your 401(k) earlier in retirement increases the risk that you run out of money. You'll want to assess that risk to make sure you’re comfortable with this potential tradeoff.You can do that by considering your withdrawal rate. Simply take the total amount you plan to withdraw from your 401(k) in a year and divide it by your account balance. In your case, you would divide $20,400 (1,700*12) by $750,000.That's 2.72%, which I would consider to be an incredibly low withdrawal rate. Assuming a consistent, inflation-adjusted withdrawal going forward and that your investments fall within a reasonable asset allocation range, the chance that you'll run out of money is quite low.If you’re planning to reduce your 401(k) withdrawals once your Social Security payments start, your risk will decrease even more. In fact, it’s possible that you’re being unnecessarily conservative and could consider withdrawing even more. However, you may be perfectly happy preserving your assets and I strongly believe that you should use your money in a way that suits you best. (A financial advisor can help you assess your risks in retirement and create an asset allocation designed to meet your needs.)I can't definitively say this is a good plan for you without knowing more about your situation, but delaying Social Security is often a smart choice and a 2.72% withdrawal rate is likely to work just fine for most retirees.I also want to point out that nothing in my answer above speaks to whether or not this plan will provide you with enough income to cover your expenses in retirement. Since you mentioned your $1,500 pension payment, I assume you decided that $1,700 from your 401(k) each month would be enough to cover your expenses. If not, you’ll want to examine your expected expenses in retirement and assess whether $3,200 is enough to meet your spending needs.Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be hard. SmartAsset's free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you.

In fact, some of the most well-known companies in the United States have seen their shares decline this year.Here are the three worst performing stocks on the benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2023 (through late December), why each has performed so poorly, and whether it might be a good time to buy them now.Company (Ticker Symbol)YTD Performance (Total Return)Market CapitalizationWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA)(23.7%)$23.0 billionChevron (NYSE: CVX)(11.5%)$289 billionJohnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ)(9%)$375 billionData source: YCharts. Performance as of Dec. 26, 2023. Parentheses indicate negative numbers. YTD = year-to-date.For comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has delivered a 15.3% total return for 2023 through Dec. 26. However, the S&P 500, which is widely considered to be a better gauge of overall U.S. stock-market performance, has produced a total return of about 26% for the year. So, while even the worst performer in the Dow might not seem like it had a terrible year (especially when compared with many stocks' 2022 performance), these stocks were significant underperformers in an overall very good year for the market.To be sure, a lot of the underperformance can be attributed to factors that aren't company specific. For example, the energy sector itself was one of the worst performing parts of the stock market, and oil prices were down by about 5% for the year, which fueled Chevron's underperformance.Plus, value stocks (which all three of these are) generally underperformed growth stocks in 2023, as the latter rebounded sharply from a rough 2022 and fueled the S&P 500's strong gains. In fact, the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: VUG) delivered a 47% total return for investors in 2023. The Vanguard Value ETF (NYSEMKT: VTV) only managed about 9%.Having said that, there are some company-specific reasons investors should be aware of before buying these stocks \"at a discount.\"Walgreens, for example, has been pursuing some ambitious growth initiatives that have cost the company profitability. It has generated negative free cash flow in two of the past four quarters, and its future path is unclear at this point. Sure, Walgreens pays a 7.2% dividend yield, but how long can it keep this up, invest billions into developing new healthcare businesses, and struggle to turn a profit?As previously mentioned, Chevron is mainly down because of falling energy prices. However, it is in the middle of acquiring Hess Corporation (NYSE: HES) in an all-stock deal, and there are some political uncertainties surrounding the deal that investors should keep an eye on. Although the stock has fallen this year, it's worth noting that Chevron started 2023 near its all-time high.Johnson & Johnson has had a volatile 2023. The recent results have looked pretty solid in the wake of the spin-off of its consumer-products business as Kenvue (NYSE: KVUE), and its 3.1% dividend yield looks very safe. However, sales for certain key products declined, and Medicare price negotiations remain a big risk factor.One very important takeaway is that these stocks aren't down for no reason. All of them have clear factors weighing on the stock price.That said, I'd personally avoid Walgreens for the time being, at least until the company's cash flow gets back on track. However, Chevron is primarily beaten down because of lower energy prices, and Johnson & Johnson appears to be an excellent business on sale due to some near-term uncertainty. This could be an excellent time for patient long-term investors to take a closer look.Should you invest $1,000 in Walgreens Boots Alliance right now?Before you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn't one of them.

{"date": "2023-12-27-22-30", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/forget-carnival-stock-investors-buy-113500795.html", "text_blocks": "A lot of businesses that were left for dead during the COVID-19 pandemic are finding new life again. This is especially the case for companies in the travel sector.Take Carnival Corp. (NYSE: CCL). The cruise operator's stock is up an impressive 135% in 2023 (as of Dec. 22). Credit goes to strong consumer demand and revenue, an entirely different situation from three years ago.However, I think investors can find a better stock to buy in order to gain exposure to travel and leisure. Keep reading to learn why you should forget about Carnival and add Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) to your portfolio instead.To give the business the credit it deserves, Carnival has been enjoying outstanding momentum in recent quarters. In the latest fiscal year (ended Nov. 30), the company generated $21.6 billion of revenue, a record. Management also said bookings and pricing trends were very strong.But if we zoom out and focus on more important factors, it's easy to find faults in the business. For starters, Carnival will likely struggle tremendously in a recessionary scenario. Given that the Treasury yield curve has been inverted since the summer of 2022, a clear sign of an impending economic downturn, Carnival might experience a huge slowdown in the not-too-distant future. And this is worrying.I'm also not a fan of the balance sheet. The business currently carries more than $30 billion of debt. That's a large sum, especially when you realize Carnival's market cap is $23.7 billion. This adds a lot of financial risk to the equation that is best avoided.Like the situation with Carnival, investors could also say that Airbnb would be adversely impacted in a recession, as consumers spend less money on travel to focus on tightening their budgets and conserving cash. But Airbnb is staring down such a huge growth opportunity that an economic downturn might have muted impacts.Management estimates the company's total addressable market in the trillions of dollars, which includes new experiences for travelers to choose from and new tech features to increase engagement, price transparency, and safety for all users. There's a lot of optionality to continue growing revenue.It's incredibly obvious that Airbnb has far more growth potential than Carnival. And for long-term investors, this creates a key tailwind to produce strong returns.Plus, Airbnb possesses powerful network effects thanks to its two-sided ecosystem of guests and hosts. There are currently more than 7 million listings on the site, with 113 million nights and experiences booked in just the last quarter. As this platform gets larger, it becomes exponentially more valuable to all stakeholders.Airbnb shares have risen 65% this year, which is a remarkable gain. However, that's less than half the return that Carnival put up. As of this writing, the travel platform's stock is still 35% below its peak price.I can see why some investors would assume that Airbnb is trading at an expensive valuation right now. After all, this is the case with a lot of growth-tech stocks. But shares go for a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16.8. That's not expensive at all, and given the attractive characteristics I just described, might even mean the stock is undervalued.And when compared to Carnival's current forward P/E multiple of 20.3, Airbnb looks like an absolute bargain on a relative basis. If we look out over the next five or 10 years, I don't believe anyone can come up with a valid argument for why Carnival's stock will generate better returns than Airbnb.This makes the latter business the much better one to own in your portfolio.Should you invest $1,000 in Airbnb right now?Before you buy stock in Airbnb, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Airbnb wasn’t one of them.

{"date": "2023-12-27-22-30", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/2-no-brainer-artificial-intelligence-111000856.html", "text_blocks": "All eyes have been on artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in 2023, with the market almost singlehandedly triggering a recovery for the Nasdaq Composite after it plunged more than 30% last year.Macroeconomic headwinds curbed consumer and commercial spending in 2022, leading to a sell-off. However, the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022 made Wall Street bullish about tech stocks again, with countless companies restructuring their businesses to focus on the technology. As a result, the index has soared 43% since Jan. 1.According to Grand View Research, the AI market is valued at $137 billion, but is projected to exceed $1 trillion by the end of the decade, expanding at a compound annual growth rate of 37%. The significant growth potential suggests it's not too late to invest in this budding industry and profit from its long-term development.Here are two no-brainer AI stocks to buy before 2024.Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) have soared 115% year to date. Chipmakers enjoyed the most stock growth amid the AI excitement, as their hardware is crucial for training and running AI models. In fact, AMD's biggest competitor, Nvidia, has seen its shares rise more than 200% this year alongside a spike in chip sales.AMD's financials have yet to reflect its potential in the sector, with its data center revenue actually dipping just under 1% year over year in the third quarter of 2023. However, that could all change in 2024, when the company will begin shipping what it calls its most powerful graphics processing unit (GPU) ever, designed specifically to compete with Nvidia's offerings.AMD's new AI GPU, the MI300X, comes at a time when the market has grown desperate for alternatives to Nvidia, with companies looking forward to increased competition reducing the cost of chips. As a result, if the chipmaker can deliver better price-to-performance, it could have a real shot at taking a significant chunk out of Nvidia's estimated 90% market share in AI chips.The MI300X is already off to a promising start, with Microsoft's Azure announcing in November that it would become the first cloud platform to use the GPU to expand its AI capabilities. Meanwhile, AMD has partnered with Meta, Cisco, and Broadcom to build advanced AI systems.AMD's soaring stock price, alongside earnings that have yet to see a return on its investment in AI, has made its shares expensive, illustrated by the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of about 52. However, EPS estimates suggest the company still has much to offer new investors.This chart shows AMD's earnings could hit $5 per share over the next two fiscal years. Multiplying that figure by the chipmaker's forward P/E yields a stock price of $265, projecting growth of 90% over the next two fiscal years.Consequently, AMD's stock is attractive ahead of 2024, and a no-brainer for anyone looking to invest in AI.While AMD looks likely to shake up the AI chip market next year, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) could be poised to see big gains from the software side of the industry.In early December the company unveiled its highly anticipated large language model, Gemini. According to CEO Sundar Pichai, the new model \"represents one of the biggest science and engineering efforts we've undertaken as a company.\" The new model is expected to be competitive with OpenAI's ChatGPT-4, and capable of crunching various forms of data such as text, video, and audio.Gemini will likely open the door to countless growth opportunities in AI. The advanced model and in-house brands like Google, Android, and YouTube could prove a powerful combination. Alphabet will have the tech to offer more efficient advertising through Google Search and YouTube, create a Search experience closer to ChatGPT, introduce AI features on its various productivity platforms, expand its range of AI tools on Google Cloud, and more.These charts display the forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) and price-to-free cash flow for some of the most prominent names in AI right now. Alphabet has the lowest figures for both metrics, indicating its stock is currently offering the most value.Alongside free cash flow that topped $78 billion this year and a newly launched AI model, Alphabet is an exciting way to invest in the burgeoning sector. It has the funds to fuel R&D, and is potentially the biggest bargain in AI. The company's stock is a screaming buy ahead of the new year.Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?Before you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Advanced Micro Devices wasn't one of them.

But if you only have a decade left before retiring, reaching millionaire status will require a lot of money (there are no shortcuts).However, by investing in these three stocks, you can boost your returns from the market's average 10% annual return to around 12% to 13%. That will require just under $300,000 ($294,588 to be exact) to hit millionaire status. So, what are these three stocks?Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the parent company of Google, YouTube, and the Android operating system. Its primary business is advertising, but it also has its hands in two important industries: artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing.These could be massive growth catalysts for Alphabet over the next decade. With Alphabet's latest generation of its Gemini generative AI model beating the competition on nearly every base mark test, it's sure to be a top choice for developers. Alphabet hasn't recognized any revenue from this segment yet, but it will be one to watch in the coming years.Cloud computing has been a huge business trend in past years as companies find it easier to outsource computing resources instead of attempting to estimate what they need on-site. It's also a beneficiary in the AI trend as companies need massive computing power to develop AI models and capture and store data needed for them. Google Cloud grew 22% last quarter, making it Alphabet's fastest-growing division. With the cloud computing market expected to expand from $626 billion in 2023 to $1.27 trillion by 2028, Alphabet is operating in a massive opportunity.Throw in Alphabet's cheap 20 times 2024 earnings stock valuation, and you've got a recipe for a company that can outperform the market by a couple of percentage points each year.MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is one of my highest-conviction stock picks. It's a leader in the Latin American e-commerce and fintech spaces and has become the combination of Amazon and PayPal in a region with twice the population of the U.S.It consistently delivered incredible results from both its commerce and fintech segments, with the two delivering 76% and 61% year-over-year currency-neutral growth, respectively, in Q3. While MercadoLibre has been a massive growth machine for a while, it's also starting to improve its margin profile. In Q3, all three major profit-margin measurements increased.MetricQ3 2022Q3 2023ImprovementGross margin50.1%53.1%2.95%Operating margin11%18.2%7.24%Profit margin4.85%9.5%4.89%Data source: MercadoLibre.This shows MercadoLibre's strong pricing power and its commitment to becoming a more efficient business. With the Latin American opportunity just starting, MercadoLibre should easily deliver market-crushing returns over the next decade.Amazon had an incredible 2023. While its growth hasn't been spectacular for most of the year, its efficiency gains have been.This bodes well for shareholders as we are yet to see Amazon fully profitable for an entire year. Furthermore, Amazon's biggest growth engine will have a great year in 2024.Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing wing, is a direct competitor to Google Cloud. However, with the massive $1.27 trillion market opportunity, there is plenty of room for multiple winners. Throughout 2023, many clients chose to optimize their spending with AWS. Management sees that trend slowing down, and new workloads (many related to AI) are starting to come online. This will be a welcome change of pace and should power Amazon higher in 2024.Still, Amazon's commerce segments have been doing better, with its advertising and third-party seller services growing at 26% and 20%, respectively, in Q3. Amazon is a cash-flow-generating powerhouse whose full potential we've yet to see. However, we'll experience it in the coming decade, and the stock returns should easily top 10% annually.While all three stocks are great buys, a well-diversified portfolio comprises at least 25 stocks. Investing all of your nearly $300,000 in these stocks alone is dangerous, as one of them could be hit with an unforeseen headwind and destroy its investment thesis. But as a part of a broader portfolio, I'm confident this trio will post market-beating returns.Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

There's a lot of investing wisdom packed into those three words. Companies that generate huge profits and cash tend to have stocks that perform exceptionally well for investors over the long term.We can look at some of the biggest winners of this year to find great examples. Here are three stocks to buy for 2024 that are practically money machines.Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) gave shareholders a lot to be merry about this holiday season. The stock is on pace to finish 2023 with a huge gain of close to 60%.Is Alphabet a money machine? The numbers speak for themselves.The tech giant generated nearly $67 billion of profits and levered free cash flow of nearly $71 billion over the 12 months ending Sept. 30, 2023. Alphabet's earnings jumped over 41% year over year in the third quarter. The company sits atop a cash stockpile of almost $120 billion.Two core businesses made those impressive results possible. Alphabet makes most of its money from advertising on Google Search and YouTube. Its Google Cloud unit is also a key growth driver.I look for both of these businesses to fire on all cylinders in 2024. An improving economy could boost advertising revenue. Alphabet's launch of Gemini Ultra, a worthy rival to OpenAI's GPT-4, should help Google Cloud accelerate its growth.Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been sizzling hot in 2023. Shares of the e-commerce and cloud services leader have skyrocketed more than 80%. Amazon is on course to post its best performance since 2015.The company generated earnings of $20 billion and levered free cash flow of more than $36 billion over the trailing-12-month period ending Sept. 30, 2023. Management has focused intently on its bottom line, and it shows. Profits more than tripled year over year in Q3. Amazon's cash position, including cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, currently tops $64 billion.Even though Amazon dominates the e-commerce market, there's still plenty of room for growth. In Q3, e-commerce accounted for 15.6% of total U.S. retail sales. The company is also expanding into new online markets, recently announcing plans to begin selling cars online in 2024.I think there's an even greater growth opportunity for Amazon Web Services (AWS). Between 5% and 10% of global IT spending is in the cloud right now, with the bulk of spending on-premises. This should flip over the next 10 to 15 years. As the market leader in cloud services, AWS is poised to benefit significantly from this growth.Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) ranks as the second-largest company in the world, based on market cap. However, this gargantuan size doesn't seem to be hindering its growth. The company's shares have soared more than 55% this year.Unsurprisingly, Microsoft is a cash cow. It generated net income of $77 billion and levered free cash flow of $50 billion over the 12 months ending Sept. 30, 2023. The company's profits jumped 27% year over year in Q3, and Microsoft's cash stockpile totals nearly $144 billion.Generative AI (artificial intelligence) continues to provide a huge catalyst for the company. The tech giant owns 49% of ChatGPT creator OpenAI's for-profit operating company. Microsoft has integrated GPT-4 throughout its products. This has made the company's Azure cloud platform especially attractive to customers.Perhaps the most appealing thing about Microsoft is that it's a leader in nearly every hot new technology. AI and cloud services are definitely on the list. So are gaming, quantum computing, and virtual reality. I expect that Microsoft will remain a big winner for investors for a long time to come.Should you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Microsoft wasn't one of them.

{"date": "2023-12-27-22-30", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/better-marijuana-stock-aurora-cannabis-140000167.html", "text_blocks": "The legal marijuana market has been evolving rapidly since 2012, when Colorado and Washington became the first U.S. states to legalize cannabis for recreational adult use. 22 additional U.S. states, two U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia have since joined them. On the world stage, recreational cannabis is now legal in Canada, Uruguay, and Malta. Several more countries, like Germany, Switzerland, and Poland, are in the process of considering more liberal marijuana policies, possibly opening the door to widespread legalization in these countries.With the political movement to legalize marijuana gaining momentum worldwide, it might be a good time to start loading up on high-quality marijuana stocks. Aurora Cannabis (NASDAQ: ACB) and Tilray Brands (NASDAQ: TLRY) are two of the most prominent names in the legal cannabis space today. Both companies originate in Canada, but they have ambitions to become global leaders in the cannabis industry. Which stock is the better buy? Let's dig deeper to find out.Aurora Cannabis is Canada's top medical marijuana producer by market share. It also has a large and growing footprint in 12 other areas, including high-value markets like Germany, Australia, and France. The company has also been investing heavily in research and development to create innovative and differentiated products that can help it build brand recognition and an economic moat. On the financial side of the ledger, Aurora's management thinks the company is on track to become cash flow positive in calendar year 2024.However, Wall Street isn't convinced about the company's near-term financial goals. Despite Aurora's recent expansion into the profitable ornamental flowers segment, most analysts think the company remains a few years away from being cash flow positive consistently. The company also lacks a robust strategy to enter the high-value U.S. market upon the end of federal prohibition. Although this may not be a major concern in the short term, as the U.S. is unlikely to end federal prohibition anytime soon, it could limit Aurora's long-term growth potential.Tilray Brands is a leader in the legal marijuana market in Canada with an industry-best 13.4% market share, and in several other countries where medical marijuana is permitted, such as Germany, Poland, and Portugal. The company also has a strong presence in the craft alcohol and beer industry through its recent expansion efforts. This non-cannabis segment is expected to be a key pillar of growth for the company while the legal marijuana industry slowly matures.Despite its diversification strategy, Tilray is still struggling to generate positive free cash flow. The company hopes to change this situation by the end of its current fiscal year, but some analysts are skeptical. For example, Morningstar's Kristoffer Inton believes that Tilray will not reach consistent profitability until late 2024 (calendar year) or early 2025. If that's true, Tilray would still be among the first within its Canadian peer group to reach this important financial milestone.Because of its diversification strategy into craft alcohol and beer, Tilray arguably screens as the better buy right now. Aurora's focus on the medical marijuana segment should prove to be a smart move over the long run, but Tilray seems closer to reaching sustainable profitability than its rival, Aurora. That being said, both of these cannabis companies face significant challenges. The legal cannabis market is growing fast, but several obstacles limit its appeal to investors at the moment.Should you invest $1,000 in Aurora Cannabis right now?Before you buy stock in Aurora Cannabis, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Aurora Cannabis wasn't one of them.

Falling oil and gas prices, along with rising interest rates, weighed on the sector.However, 2024 could be a much different story for the industry. Several energy companies have compelling catalysts on the horizon that could fuel growth in the coming year. Noble Corporation (NYSE: NE), Clearway Energy (NYSE: CWEN)(NYSE: CWEN.A), and Canadian Solar (NASDAQ: CSIQ) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors as smart energy stocks to buy for 2024, given their high-powered total return potential.Tyler Crowe (Noble): The offshore oil industry is setting up for a few good years, and few companies are better positioned to take advantage of that than offshore rig company Noble. Instead of focusing on its high-specification fleet or its pristine balance sheet. I want to focus on one element that makes 2024 look like a great year for Noble: Its contracts.Offshore rig companies lease their fleets to oil producers and use contracts that depend on the size of the job. Most of these contracts pay a set rate per day (there are some bonuses for efficiency and operational uptime, but that's getting too deep into the weeds). The market rate for these rigs depends on the amount of work producers want to do, the fleet of rigs that can handle the job, and the fleet of rigs that are available to do that job.As of the most recent report from Wood Mackenzie, about 85% of offshore rigs are contracted, and several oil producers will be looking to contract new rig work in 2024. That same WoodMac study said rates for high-specification rigs could be more than $500,000 per day.Right now, the average rate for Noble's fleet is $404,000 per day, but close to 75% of its rigs are either finishing up a contract or at a repricing event for longer-term contracts. If analyst predictions prove correct, Noble could lock in some monster rates for its fleet in 2024 that would probably flow to the bottom line.Matt DiLallo (Clearway Energy): Shares of Clearway Energy have slumped nearly 17% in 2023. The main culprit has been rising interest rates. They've caused concerns that funding new renewable energy projects would become too costly, which could slow the sector's growth.However, interest rates aren't an issue for Clearway because it already has all the funding needed to support its growth plan through 2026. Last year, the company sold its thermal assets, giving it a boatload of cash to redeploy into higher return opportunities. The clean-energy producer has already secured deals to put all that cash to work in transactions that should close over the next couple of years. That gives it a clear line of sight on future cash flow growth.The visibility into its future cash flows drives the company's conviction that it can grow its dividend (which yields 6% following its sell-off) in the upper end of its 5% to 8% annual target range through 2026. Meanwhile, recent contract renewals on some gas-fired power plants have given it a head start on growth beyond 2026. Those higher rate renewals alone could help power dividend growth toward the low end of its range in 2027.Clearway's high-yielding and steadily rising dividend provides investors with a strong base return. Add in earnings growth and the likely fading of interest rate headwinds as the Federal Reserve starts cutting them next year, and the clean energy producer could produce powerful total returns in 2024 and beyond.Jason Hall (Canadian Solar): Say it with me: cyclical shifts; secular trends.What this means for investors is that solar stocks are not \"buy anytime\" investments. During peak euphoria, investors can bid up solar stocks to unreasonable valuations, only to see the stocks crash when the cycle turns away from growth:To be clear, not every solar stock crashing from a cyclical high has been a buy; plenty of less-than-stellar companies have gotten caught up in the good times only to never recover.I don't think that's likely to be the case with Canadian Solar, a giant in the solar industry. Canadian Solar manufactures solar panels and energy storage systems for both the distributed and utility scale markets, and its Recurrent Energy subsidiary is a major developer of renewable energy projects. It's also one of the most profitable of the large solar companies, too.Despite the slowdown in the second half of 2023, management is expecting a bumper year in 2024 for both solar and battery storage, while the market is pricing it for a disaster. At recent prices, shares trade for 5 times trailing earnings, and 65% of book value. With almost $2 billion in cash on hand and a manageable debt load, its balance sheet is sufficient to bridge across the current downturn to the back half of 2024 when business should start to recover, potentially in some very big ways.Should you invest $1,000 in Noble right now?Before you buy stock in Noble Plc, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Noble Corporation wasn't one of them.

{"date": "2023-12-27-22-30", "error": false, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com//news/only-3-magnificent-seven-stocks-110000321.html", "text_blocks": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks dominated in 2023 -- all outperforming the S&P 500 by a wide margin. The term was coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe seven large tech-focused companies: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA).Each company has its own pros and cons. But one thing is certain among them all. They've all gotten a lot more expensive after this year's run-up, so it's time to be selective in 2024. Valuations matter, and there's only so much an investor should pay for a company's future earnings.With that in mind, here's why Tesla, Apple, and Microsoft are the only three Magnificent Seven stocks I would consider buying next year.Out of all the Magnificent Seven stocks, Tesla is down the most from its all-time high. And for good reason.The company is not at the top of its game from a growth or profitability perspective. It's also unclear if Tesla will remain the undisputed leader in electric vehicles a decade from now, especially as so many companies are trying to take market share.And unlike companies like Nvidia and Microsoft that directly benefit from artificial intelligence (AI), Tesla has moonshots that simply haven't materialized.The history of Tesla is riddled with starkly contrasting opinions on whether it is grossly overvalued or is the greatest company ever. And there's a good chance that its future will also face breakout potential or a lot of room to collapse. But what I like about Tesla is that it has a good setup for 2024 and beyond. There are specific things to look for that could support or take away from the investment thesis.In the short term, Tesla needs to prove it can fund its long-term growth plans even during a downturn in the business cycle. Tesla's long-term success depends on increasing production, achieving massive scale, and then unlocking pricing power to make vehicles more efficiently than the competition, and therefore, win on quality and quantity. It already has this advantage now. But to preserve it, Tesla will need to build more factories and manage its extremely complex supply chain.In the longer term, Tesla will need to monetize its AI and robotics investments. If it makes a leap in self-driving, it could open the door to the coveted robotaxi market, which could completely reimagine ride-sharing and deliveries.The company's decision to slash prices and take a hit to its margins to focus on volume looks bad now. But it could end up being a brilliant move if it discourages other automakers from ramping up EV spending, leaving Tesla to extend its lead over the competition. After all, if Tesla shows it has immense pricing power and can afford to undercut the competition, that may deter companies from going toe-to-toe with Tesla at the risk of losing billions in the process.In this vein, there's a path for Tesla to either sustain its production growth, recover its margins, or both in 2024. If that happens, the stock could do very well next year. But even if Tesla's performance stalls in the near term, it still has so much potential upside that simply can't be ignored. Even more than margin or volume improvements, investors should monitor Tesla's self-driving progress in 2024.Apple stands out as the \"safest\" Magnificent Seven stock. It has the best valuation, especially considering the company's relentless stock repurchase program. Buybacks decrease the outstanding share count, boost earnings per share, and make the stock a better value even if it doesn't grow earnings organically.Apple is also conservative with its spending. It doesn't chase growth just for the sake of it. Instead, it has a purposeful product development pipeline. So if the market does sell off or valuations compress across industries, then Apple will be in an excellent position to deploy some of its cash on a timely acquisition.Apple is unique because it can thrive when the economy is doing well and consumer spending is high. But it also has a nice margin of error in case things take a turn for the worse.Apple has a 31.5 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio compared to 33.3 for the Invesco QQQ Trust, which mirrors the performance of the 100 largest Nasdaq stocks. Apple is a higher-quality company than the rest of the Nasdaq 100, even with lower growth. And for that reason, it looks like a good value heading into 2024.Like Tesla, Microsoft has a clear setup for 2024. At just about every investor event or presentation this year, Microsoft would make sure you knew just how much it was investing in AI and how big of an opportunity it was. Even if the rhetoric is over the top at times, Microsoft is correct in that it has its finger on the pulse of the consumer and business community. It is implementing AI across its products and services. And because it can monitor the reception of these updates, it can see what is and isn't working and then make adjustments.Microsoft is a straightforward and easy-to-understand AI play. In many ways, its solutions are nothing groundbreaking. One example is Microsoft Copilot, which act as an assistant in an application to make it easier to use and let the user accomplish tasks faster.The company generates tons of free cash flow, has an impeccable balance sheet, and can fund both near-term and long-term AI investments with the wiggle room to take risks and make mistakes. Microsoft has a balanced risk/reward profile when it comes to investing in AI.Understanding the market's attitude toward a theme or industry at a given time can help you make wise investment decisions.It wasn't long ago, just last year in fact, that many investors wanted nothing to do with Amazon because of its slowing growth and overspending. Or with Alphabet, because the only good use of its cash seemed to be buybacks. Or with Tesla, because consumer spending was crashing in the wake of higher interest rates and EV competition was getting more ruthless.Meta Platforms was left for dead after the market thought Instagram was losing market share and the company was wasting money on the Metaverse. Even Nvidia crashed as investors thought the cyclical slowdown would damage the growth trajectory. Microsoft and Apple held up better last year, but mostly because they have lower valuations and wider moats.This is all to say that sentiment can change in an instant. And that's exactly what happened in 2023.Anything can happen in 2024. As it stands now, there are only three Magnificent Seven stocks that look like good buys. But if there's a major market sell-off or a prolonged bear market, all seven companies are worth a closer look.The secret lies in finding which ones you like the best and having the conviction to step in and buy those stocks, even when the market wants nothing to do with them.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Those sinking prices have come as the US has pumped a record amount of oil, flooding markets with a glut of supply — and it's gone directly against OPEC's attempts to boost prices by slashing production.More broadly for oil markets next year, Kilduff sees crumbling demand in the face of a slowing global economy.\"For the most part, there's headwinds here in terms of the economic outlook,\" he said. \"The reason global central banks are cutting rates is not just because the inflation situation has potentially been tamed but because the economic outlook is softening, and that's going to speak right into crude oil demand, energy demand, for next year.\"The US central bank has also been eyeing rate cuts next year as key economic data like inflation has hinted at signs of a cooling economy. But rate cuts might not be all that positive a sign, and are more like a double-edged sword. According to Kilduff, it could crush demand for oil.Meanwhile, the turmoil in the Middle East seems less threatening to oil, Kilduff added, noting that recent attacks by Houthi rebels on key shipping routes wouldn't be a big deal, and that markets didn't budge much after other political events like missile attacks by Houthis in 2019, or the US drone strike in 2020 that assassinated Iranian major general Qasem Soleimani.\"We will have these pinprick events, there may be some boost in oil price like we are seeing today,\" he said. \"Plus, it's a thinly traded market so they're getting that advantage. But in terms of this thing escalating, at some point in time, the Iranians will cross a line that will get them put back in their box, or their agents.\"Read the original article on Business Insider"}

However, some stocks don't require nearly as much analysis as others. And a few are practically no-brainers. Here are three monster stocks to buy without any hesitation.Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) isn't an 800-pound gorilla in e-commerce -- it's a 900-pound gorilla. The company accounts for nearly 38% of the U.S. e-commerce market, according to Statista. Market researcher PYMTS puts the number at 48%. The market share for Amazon's closest rival -- Walmart -- is no higher than 7% using either data source.It's a closer contest in cloud services, but Amazon still reigns as king of that fast-growing market. Amazon Web Services ranks as the top cloud infrastructure provider with a market share of 32%. That's well ahead of No. 2 Microsoft Azure's market share of 22%.The great news for investors is that Amazon has plenty of room to grow in both e-commerce and cloud services. E-commerce only made up 15.6% of total U.S. retail sales in the third quarter. Amazon continues to expand its online footprint by moving into new areas such as selling cars. Currently, less than 10% of global IT spending is in the cloud. That percentage is expected to skyrocket over the next 10 to 15 years.In the meantime, Amazon is focused on increasing its profits like never before. The company's earnings more than tripled year over year in Q3. With this type of improvement combined with the opportunities presented by generative AI, Amazon should keep up its winning ways for a long time to come.Amazon doesn't dominate e-commerce everywhere. In Latin America, MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) rules. That's especially the case in Brazil, where the company enjoys a market share of more than 50%.Business is booming for MercadoLibre. Its net revenue soared 69% year over year in Q3 on a constant-currency basis. Gross merchandise volume jumped 59%. The number of unique buyers grew by 18% year over year.E-commerce isn't MercadoLibre's only business, though. The company's logistics unit achieved a record fulfillment penetration of 48% in Q3. Its fintech digital account total payment volume vaulted nearly 189% higher on a constant-currency basis.Latin America's e-commerce volume is much smaller than the markets in North America, Europe, and Asia. However, that gives MercadoLibre strong growth opportunities. The company also has great prospects in Latin America's fintech market.An estimated 88,000 people in the U.S., Europe, Australia, and Canada have cystic fibrosis. Only four therapies are approved for treating the underlying cause of the rare genetic disease. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) makes all of them.Despite having a monopoly in cystic fibrosis, Vertex still has room for growth in the market. It's securing additional approvals and reimbursement deals to treat younger patients. The company is also developing new therapies for the condition. Vertex expects to soon report results from late-stage studies of its vanzacaftor triple-drug combo, which could be its most powerful cystic fibrosis therapy yet. And it's working with Moderna on developing a messenger RNA drug that could help the roughly 5,000 patients who can't benefit from current therapies.Vertex isn't stopping at cystic fibrosis, though. The big biotech recently won U.S. approval for exa-cel as a treatment for sickle cell disease. It hopes to pick up a second U.S. approval for the gene-editing therapy as a treatment for transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia in the first quarter of 2024.In addition, Vertex's pipeline is loaded with promising programs. VX-548 holds the potential to become a blockbuster non-opioid pain treatment. Inaxaplin could become the first approved therapy that treats the underlying cause of APOL1-mediated kidney disease, which affects more patients than cystic fibrosis. Vertex also is moving forward with several candidates that could effectively cure type 1 diabetes. With this abundance of riches in its pipeline, this stock -- like Amazon and MercadoLibre -- is a monster that should grow even bigger.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Rough times have a way of separating great companies from merely good ones, and although no one is asking for difficulties, these moments can often strengthen a business for the better.But not every top company is out of the woods just yet. Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) is still reeling from challenges of the past few years, with new ones taking the place of old ones and keeping Disney stuck in a rut. There have been pockets of good news throughout, and Disney recently made a sweet announcement to start the new year off right.Disney suspended its dividend in light of pandemic difficulties, and although it has been almost four years and the parks business has rebounded, it hasn't reinstated it until now. Management said that it would issue a dividend of $0.30 on Jan. 10 to shareholders as of Dec. 11, 2023. That implies a yield of 0.66%, which isn't great, but it's a start.Prior to the suspension, Disney's dividend yielded around 1.5%, or about the S&P 500 average. Disney is an old stock, having traded over the counter since 1940 before an initial public offering in 1957. It has paid a dividend from the beginning but only started raising it in 1989.It has had a great run, growing much more than storied dividends from stocks like Coca-Cola and Proctor and Gamble, before being put on hold in 2020.Disney's been through a lot of ups and downs over the past four years, including a new CEO -- and now its old CEO. Bob Iger is trying to set things straight by reverting to the company's tried-and-true model of a powerful parks segment and blockbuster films, both fueled by an incredible content-creation machine. He's aiming to get streaming spending under control, boost profits, and reward shareholders.Shareholders have been disillusioned by Disney's ongoing challenges, and Disney stock is up just 6% this year, sharply underperforming the market. It's still 53% off its highs, and it's going to take more work to drive the share price higher.According to Board Chairman Mark Parker, \"This has been a year of important progress for The Walt Disney Company ... As Disney moves forward with its key strategic objectives, we are pleased to declare a dividend for our shareholders while we continue to invest in the company's future and prioritize meaningful value creation.\"On the most recent earnings call, Iger mentioned a strong balance sheet and robust cash flow as an impetus to restart the dividend. These are both bouncing back nicely, and now that Disney has the money, it's giving back to patient shareholders.Disney has the money to pay the dividend, and it doesn't look like investors need to worry about its ability to pay it and keep operations running.Don't buy Disney stock for the January dividend; you'll get better yields elsewhere. This is mostly a gesture that says, \"We're back.\" However, it does look like things are moving in the right direction for Disney, and this could be the start of a real rebound for the media giant.Should you invest $1,000 in Walt Disney right now?Before you buy stock in Walt Disney, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walt Disney wasn't one of them.
