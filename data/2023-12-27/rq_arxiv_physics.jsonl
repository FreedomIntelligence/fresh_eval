They play prominent roles in algebraic geometry and diﬀeren tial topology.\nIn algebraic geometry, blowups are constructed using coord inate charts, as in [4, p603]. In diﬀer-\nential topology, they can be constructed using either compa tible collections of coordinate charts or\ntubular neighborhood identiﬁcations. The latter approach is quicker, less cumbersome, and more\nconvenient for studying the changes in the topology under bl owups, as in [5, Section 3] and [1,\nSection 3.2]. However, the former approach may be more suita ble in settings with natural compat-\nible collections of coordinate charts, as is the case in [2, S ections 4,5], for example. In this paper,\nwe show that the global and local approaches to blowup constr uctions in diﬀerential topology are\n∗Partially supported by NSF grant DMS 2301493\n1equivalent.\nThroughout this paper, Xdenotes a smooth manifold and Y⊂Xa closed submanifold of (real or\ncomplex) codimension c(Yis closed as a topological subspace of X, is without boundary, but may\nbe non-compact if Xis not compact). We consider three types of blowups of XalongY,\nπ:BLR\nYX−→X, π :BLC\nYX−→X,andπ:BLNc1X−→X, (1.1)\nwhich we call the real,complex, andNc1-augmented (or justc1-augmented) blowups, respectively.\nThe last two blowups involve a choice of complex structure on the normal bundle NXYofYinX\nand a subbundle Nc1⊂NXYof corank c1<c, respectively. The three maps in (1.1) are surjective,\nproper, and smooth. The restrictions\nπ:BLR\nYX−π−1(Y)−→X−Y, π :BLC\nYX−π−1(Y)−→X−Y, (1.2)\nandπ:BLNc1X−π−1(Y)−→X−Y (1.3)\nare diﬀeomorphisms. The local constructions of the complex a nd augmented blowups depend on\nthe choice of a compatible collection of local charts for Xthat cover Y. Such a collection deter-\nmines a complex structure on NXYin the complex case and a distinguished subbundle Nc1⊂NXY\nin the augmented case. The global constructions of these two blowups depend on the choice of a\ntubular neighborhood identiﬁcation. The global construct ion of an augmented blowup is actually\ntwo real blowups, ﬁrst along Yand then along RPNc1⊂RP(NXY), followed by a real blowdown\nin a diﬀerent direction.\nThe restrictions of πto theexceptional loci\nπ:ER\nYX≡π−1(Y)−→Yandπ:EC\nYX≡π−1(Y)−→Y\nin the ﬁrst two cases are isomorphic to the real and complex pr ojectivizations, RP(NXY) and\nCP(NXY), respectively, of NXY.

The PML method is well-known for its exponential convergence rate and easy imple-\nmentation for scattering problems with unbounded domains. For rough-surface scattering problems,\nauthors in [5] proved that the PML method converges at most algebraically in the physical domain.\nHowever, the authors also asked a question whether exponential convergence still holds for compact\nsubsets. In [25], one of our authors proved the exponential convergence for 2 π-periodic surfaces via\nthe Floquet-Bloch transform when 2 k∈R+\\Zwhere kis the wavenumber; when 2 k∈R+∩Z,\na nearly fourth-order convergence rate was shown in [26]. The extension of this method to locally\nperturbed cases is not straightforward, since the domain is no longer periodic thus the Floquet-Bloch\ntransform doesn’t work, especially when the domain topology is changed. Moreover, the exact decay\nrate when 2 k∈R+∩Zremains unclear. The purpose of this paper is to address these two significant\nissues. For the first topic, the main idea is to reduce the problem by the DtN map on an artificial\ncurve, then the convergence rate of the PML is obtained from the investigation of the DtN map. It\nshows exactly the same convergence rate as in the unperturbed case. Second, to illustrate the con-\nvergence rate when 2 k∈R+∩Z, we design a specific periodic structure for which the PML converges\nat the fourth-order, showing that the algebraic convergence rate is sharp. We adopt a previously\ndeveloped high-accuracy PML-BIE solver to exhibit this unexpected phenomenon.\n1. Introduction. For the numerical simulation of wave scattering problems in\nunbounded domains, the perfectly matched layers (PML), which was invented by\nBerenger in 1994 in [4], is a widely used cut-off technique. The main idea of this\nmethod is to add an absorbing layer outside the physical domain, then the problem is\napproximated by a truncated problem with a proper boundary condition. We refer to\n[13] to a detailed discussion of this method. In this paper, we will focus on the PML\nconvergence for wave scattering problems with locally perturbed periodic surfaces.\nIn the past decades, many mathematicians have been working on the theoreti-\ncal analysis and numerical implementations of scattering problems with (locally per-\nturbed) periodic structures. For a special case, when the incident is quasi-periodic\nand the structure is purely periodic, there is a well established framework such that\nthe problem is easily reduced into one periodicity cell. We refer to [14, 1, 22] for\ntheoretical discussions and [2, 3, 16] for numerical results. However, when the surface\nis perturbed, or the incident field is not periodic (e.g., point sources, Herglotz wave\nfunctions), this framework no longer works. Despite the periodicity, the problem can\nbe treated as a general rough surface scattering problem. In [6], the well-posedness of\nthe problems have been proved in a normal Sobolev space even for non-periodic sur-\nfaces and it is also proved in weighted Sobolev spaces in [5]. For radiation conditions\nfor the scattered field, we refer to [12, 11].\nIn order to take the advantage of the (locally perturbed) periodic structures,\nthe Floquet-Bloch transform is applied to these problems, see [9, 10] for numerical\nimplementations with absorbing media. In [17], the authors studied Herglotz wave\nfunctions scattered by periodic surfaces, with the help of the Floquet-Bloch transform.\nThe method was extended to locally perturbed periodic surfaces in [15].

The complex structures of diﬀerent ﬂat p ieces are not compatible\nhowever, reﬂecting that the global geometry is not a linear s uperposition. For either\norientation the space must be Gibbons-Hawking (thus exclud ing the Atiyah-Hitchin\nmetric), and, if the orientations are opposite, it must also be toric and have an\nirreducible Killing tensor. We also show that the only hyper -Kähler 4-metric with a\nnon-constant Killing-Yano tensor is the half-ﬂat Taub-NUT instanton.\n1 Introduction\nThe path integral for Euclidean Quantum Gravity is expected to be dominated by gravi-\ntational instantons [1, 2] (Ricci-ﬂat, complete Riemannia n 4-manifolds). Recent develop-\nments [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] suggest that the existence of compatible , integrable complex structures\nin these spaces is one of their central features. Due to Ricci -ﬂatness, this is equivalent\nto conformally Kähler, reducing to hyper-Kähler if the conf ormal factor is constant. A\nconformal Kähler structure introduces some features which are not pre sent in the purely\nKähler case (e.g. isometries), or which require a diﬀerent t reatment (e.g. twistor de-\nscriptions). In this note we are interested in instantons th at are both hyper-Kähler and\nconformally Kähler, where the two structures may have the sa me or opposite orientation.\nOur focus is on symmetries, twistor aspects and relations to ﬂat space structures.\nTod and Ward showed in [8] that if an anti-self-dual vacuum sp ace, i.e. one in which\nRab= 0,˜ΨA′B′C′D′= 0 (1.1)\n(whereRabis the Ricci tensor and ˜ΨA′B′C′D′the self-dual Weyl curvature spinor) admits\na non-constant, valence-2 primed Killing spinor, then it is necessarily given, on positive-\ndeﬁnite sections, by the Gibbons-Hawking ansatz. In view of subsequent developments\n∗bernardo.araneda@aei.mpg.de\n1[9, 10], we can restate this result as saying that a hyper-Käh ler 4-manifold with an equally\noriented conformal Kähler structure must be Gibbons-Hawki ng.\nRequiring completeness of the Gibbons-Hawking space leads to a gravitational multi-\ninstanton [11]. These metrics are obtained by appropriatel y combining ﬂat 4-space met-\nrics. Page showed [12] that also the Green’s functions for va rious ﬁelds can be obtained\nby a suitable combination of ﬂat 4-space pieces. In this note we wish to show that the\nconformal Kähler structure is similarly given by suitably c ombining ﬂat pieces, each cor-\nresponding to a twistor elementary state1in the asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE)\ncase, and the same plus a self-dual dyon in the asymptoticall y locally ﬂat (ALF) case.\nHowever, we will show that the complex structures of diﬀeren t ﬂat pieces are not compat-\nible, which we interpret as manifesting the fact that the glo bal geometry is not a linear\nsuperposition of elementary states but the instantons “int eract”.\nOn the other hand, the other possibility is that the conforma l Kähler orientation\nis opposite to the hyper-Kähler one. In this case, we will sho w that the metric must\nagain be Gibbons-Hawking (and so, conformally Kähler on bot h sides), but with more\nsymmetries: there are two commuting Killing vectors and an i rreducible Killing tensor,\nalthough generally no non-constant Killing-Yano tensor. ( In fact, we will see that the\nonly hyper-Kähler metric with a non-constant Killing-Yano tensor is half-ﬂat Taub-NUT.)\nFurthermore, by comparison to the literature [13, 14], the g eometry must be an ALE two-\ncentred multi-instanton.

Integrability and\nnon-integrability of weights of the form e−2ϕhave been of fundamental importance\nin several complex variables ever since the work of H¨ ormander, Bo mbieri, Skoda and\nothers onL2estimates for the ∂operator, cf. [H¨ o65, Bo70, Sk72]. The algebraic\ncounterparts of these weights also have played a central role in hig her dimensional\nalgebraic geometry, cf. [Ko97, KM98, La04] and the references t herein.\nThe non-integrable locus W(ϕ)⊂Xis the subset of points where e−2ϕis not\nlocally integrable. Bombieri [Bo70] showed the initial result that W(ϕ) is closed and\ncontainedinananalytichypersurface[Bo70, Theorem2,Addendu m].

The ideals\nJ(cϕ),c>0, play a key role in many questions of complex analysis and geometry:\nsee [D11, D13] for introductions.\nThe situation is well understood if ϕhasanalytic singularities , see Deﬁnition 2.1.\nFor example in the divisorial case, this is when locally ϕ=/summationtextm\ni=1cilog|gi|+u, where\ntheci≥0 are real, the giare holomorphic, and uis bounded. In algebraic and\nanalytic geometry, these are frequently treated as R-divisors ∆ :=/summationtextm\ni=1ciDi, where\nDi:= (gi= 0). For divisors, one can use Hironaka’s resolution of singularities\nto reduce many questions to the special case/summationtextm\ni=1cilog|zi|, where the ziare local\ncoordinates.\nFor general plurisubharmonic functions ϕ, such methods are not available, and\nmany new phenomena appear. For example, ϕmay be equal to −∞on a dense\nsubset of the domain, or the jumping numbers of multiplier ideals J(cϕ) may have\naccumulation points, cf. [GL20, KS20, Se21].\nIn many applications the key question is to understand the transitio n from inte-\ngrability to non-integrability. Following algebraic geometry terminolog y, we say that\na pair (X,ϕ) iskltatp∈XifJ(ϕ) =OXatp, that is, if e−2ϕis locally integrable\natp.1We say that ( X,ϕ) islc(orlog canonical ) atpif (X,(1−δ)ϕ) is klt for every\nsmallδ >0.\nOur main theorem says that, unexpectedly, the multiplier ideals of log canonical\nplurisubharmonic functions are the same as the multiplier ideals of log c anonical\ndivisors.\nTheorem 1.1. LetXbe a complex manifold and ϕa quasi-plurisubharmonic func-\ntion onX. Suppose that (X,ϕ)is log canonical at every point of X.

The existence of a median-type ternary operation on a metric space is known\nto have a number of implications for the geometry of the space . For such operations, if two\nof the three arguments coincide, they also coincide with the output of the operation. We\nconsider ternary operations with the opposite property: if two of the arguments coincide,\nthe output is equal to the third one. The existence of such an o peration is a necessary\ncondition for the space to be an absolute retract.\n1.Introduction\nIn 1979, van Mill and van de Vel [16] launched the investigati on of topological spaces X\nthat admit a continuous ternary operation σwith the absorption property :\n(1.1) σ(a,a,b) =σ(a,b,a) =σ(b,a,a) =a∀a,b∈X.\nSuch an operation, called a mixerin [16], is inherited by any retract of X, thus provid-\ning a strong necessary condition for a continuum to be an abso lute retract [16, 17]. The\nprototypical example of a mixer is the coordinate-wise medi an on the Hilbert cube [0 ,1]∞.\nIn this paper we compare (1.1) with its natural counterpart, theanti-absorption property :\n(1.2) τ(a,a,b) =τ(a,b,a) =τ(b,a,a) =b∀a,b∈X.\nWe call a continuous map τ:X3→Xwith the property (1.2) a co-mixer. The prototypical\nexample of such an operation is the symmetric diﬀerence of set s:τ(A,B,C) =A△B△C.\nWhenXis a metric space, one often considers its Lipschitz retract s instead of merely\ncontinuous ones. Such retracts inherit Lipschitz (co-)mix ers from the original space. Every\nabsolute Lipschitz retract admits a Lipschitz mixer, and th e converse holds under additional\nassumptions [10]. In this paper we will show that:\n(i) a connected ﬁnite CW-complex with a co-mixer must be contractible ( §2)\n(ii) a metric space with a Lipschitz co-mixer may have nontri vial fundamental group ( §2)\n(iii) a metric space may admit a Lipschitz mixer without a Lip schitz co-mixer, and vice\nversa ( §2–3)\n2020Mathematics Subject Classiﬁcation.

The book [7] contains the\nnecessary background; in particular, see [7, §3.C] onH-spaces.\nProposition 2.1. Suppose that Xis a topological space with a co-mixer τ. Then for\nevery point e∈Xand every n∈Nthe homotopy group πn(X,e)satisﬁes 2α= 0for all\nα∈πn(X,e). If, in addition, Xis a connected ﬁnite CW-complex, then it is contractible.\nProof.The binary operation µ(x,y) =τ(x,y,e) satisﬁes µ(x,e) =x=µ(e,x) for allx∈X\nand thus makes XanH-space. By the Eckmann-Hilton argument, the group operatio n on\nπn(X,e) is commutative and agrees with the one induced by µ(see Theorems 3.1 and 3.2\nin [11]). Since µ(x,x) =efor allx∈X, it follows that 2 α= 0 for all α∈πn(X,e). If, in\naddition, Xis a connected ﬁnite CW-complex, then the fact that 2 πn(X,e) = 0 for all n\nimplies that Xis contractible [2, §3]. /square\nEvery topological space with a mixer has trivial homotopy gr oups of all orders [16, The-\norem 1.3] (the theorem is stated for continua but the proof wo rks in greater generality). In\ncontrast, some spaces with a co-mixer are not simply-connec ted.\nProposition 2.2. There exists a connected metric space Xwith a Lipschitz co-mixer and\nπ1(X)∼=Z/(2Z).\nProof.Letλbe the Lebesgue measure on [0 ,1]. LetMbe the associated measure algebra,\ni.e., the set of all measurable subsets of [0 ,1] modulo nullsets. When endowed with the\nmetricρ(A,B) =λ(A△B), the measure algebra becomes a contractible metric space. It\nadmits both a Lipschitz mixer:\n(2.1) σ(A,B,C) = (A∩B)∪(A∩C)∪(B∩C)\nand a Lipschitz co-mixer:\n(2.2) τ(A,B,C) =A△B△C.ANTI-ABSORBING TERNARY OPERATIONS ON METRIC SPACES 3\nThe set complement operation is an isometric involution on M. By identifying each set\nwith its complement we obtain a quotient space ( /tildewiderM,/tildewideρ) where\n/tildewideρ([A],[B]) = min( λ(A△B),λ(A△Bc)).\nBy construction π1(/tildewiderM)∼=Z/(2Z), which implies that /tildewiderMdoes not admit a mixer. In\nparticular, (2.1) does not descend to the quotient. In contr ast, (2.2) does: the induced\nco-mixer\n/tildewideτ([A],[B],[C]) = [A△B△C]\nis well-deﬁned on /tildewiderM3, and it is easy to see that /tildewideτis 1-Lipschitz in each argument. /square\nIn the context of nonsmooth metric spaces, the concept of Lip schitz homotopy is some-\ntimes preferable to continuous homotopy [4, 6]. It is thus re levant to note that the Lipschitz\nfundamental group of the space in Proposition 2.2 is also non trivial. Ind"}

Meyer,1Nathaniel Selub,1and Frederick Wehlen1\n1University of Chicago, 5640 S. Ellis Ave., Chicago, IL 60637\nABSTRACT\nCausal relationships in conformal geometry are used to analyze angular boundaries of cosmic mi-\ncrowave background (CMB) correlations. It is shown that curvature correlations limited to timelike\nintervals on world lines that have connected causal diamonds during inflation generate an angular cor-\nrelation function C(Θ) of gravitationally-induced CMB anisotropy that vanishes in a range of angular\nseparation from Θ = π/2−arcsin(1 /4) to as far as Θ = 3 π/4. This model-independent symmetry is\nshown to agree remarkably well with even-parity and dipole-corrected CMB correlations measured in\nall-sky maps from the WMAP andPlanck satellites. Realizations of the standard quantum field theory\ncosmological model are shown to produce comparably small correlation with probabilities ranging from\n≃10−4.3to≃10−1.5, depending on the map and range of angular separation. These measurements\nare interpreted as evidence for a causal symmetry based on a basic physical principle not included\nin the effective field theory approximation to cosmological quantum gravity: quantum fluctuations\nonly generate physical correlations of spacetime curvature within regions bounded by causal diamonds .\nTheoretical implications and further cosmological tests of this interpretation are briefly discussed.\n1.INTRODUCTION\nIn classical cosmology, gravitational potential per-\nturbations on the largest scales at late times approx-\nimately preserve the primordial pattern laid down on\nthose scales at the earliest times (Bardeen 1980). In the\ncontext of cosmic inflation, the temperature anisotropy\nof the cosmic microwave background (CMB) on large\nangular scales is the most direct measurement of pri-\nmordial quantum gravitational fluctuations because its\npattern since the earliest times has been shaped only by\ngravity (Sachs & Wolfe 1967; Hu & Dodelson 2002).\nIn spite of this unique significance, CMB correlations\nat large angles are generally disregarded in precision cos-\nmological tests, primarily because the standard picture\nof inflation predicts a large variance in possible out-\ncomes. This “cosmic variance” originates from the quan-\ntum model used to compute the statistical properties of\nprimordial fluctuations, based on quantum field theory\n(QFT) (Baumann 2011): on large scales, the anisotropy\nis mostly shaped by a small number of long-wavelength\nmodes, with a range of independent amplitudes and\nphases.\nCorresponding author: Craig Hogan\ncraighogan@uchicago.eduAt the same time, the CMB correlation function C(Θ)\nover a range of large angular separation Θ is measured\nto have absolute values that are anomalously small com-\npared to expected realizations of the QFT model (Ben-\nnett et al. 2003; Copi et al. 2009; Bennett et al. 2011;\nPlanck Collaboration 2016, 2020a; Muir et al. 2018; Hag-\nimoto et al. 2020). This anomaly is customarily inter-\npreted as a statistical fluke, but it could be evidence\nfor a new physical effect, perhaps even a unique indica-\ntion that QFT does not correctly describe gravitational\nphysics at large length scales.\nIndeed, it is known that QFT has foundational theo-\nretical inconsistencies with active gravity on large scales,\nsince, among other issues, causal structure itself is not\nincluded as part of the quantum system (Cohen et al.\n1999; Hollands & Wald 2004; Stamp 2015). Since cosmo-\nlogical curvature perturbations inherit their spatial pat-\ntern from quantum fluctuations of gravity on the scale\nof causal horizons, they are uniquely suited to search\nfor departures from QFT on these scales (Hogan 2019,\n2020).\nIn previous work (Hogan & Meyer 2022; Hogan et al.\n2023), we used classical models of noise composed of per-\nturbative gravitational shock displacements during infla-\ntion to estimate correlations from fluctuations coherent\non null surfaces, and compared them with the observed\nlarge-scale anisotropy of the CMB. In this paper, we\ndo not model the magnitude of nonzero correlations orarXiv:2312.16147v1  [astro-ph.CO]  26 Dec 20232\nthe quantum dynamics of fluctuations, but instead use\ninflationary causal structure to identify a range of an-\ngular separation over which correlations are predicted\nto vanish. This purely geometrical, parameter-free ap-\nproach is based solely on boundaries of classical causal\nrelationships and a specific hypothesis about the causal\nboundaries of physical quantum phenomena.\nOur hypothesis is that primordial fluctuations are\n“causally coherent,” in the sense that they only pro-\nduce nonzero relict correlations within the geometri-\ncal boundaries of two-way causal relationships between\nworld lines defined by causal diamonds during inflation.\nWe first describe the basic causal constraints on mea-\nsurement that motivate thi"}

Code: github.com/\nyuhanghe01/SoundCount.\nIntroduction\nSuppose you went to the seaside and heard a cacophony of\nseagulls, squawking and squabbling. An interesting question\nthat naturally arises is whether you can tell the number of\nseagulls flocking around you from the sound you heard? Al-\nthough a trivial example, this sound “crowd counting” prob-\nlem has a number of important applications. For example,\npassive acoustic monitoring is widely used to record sounds\nin natural habitats, which provides measures of ecosystem\ndiversity and density (Aguiar et al. 2021; Dohi et al. 2021;\nChronister et al. 2021). Sound counting helps to quantify\nand map sound pollution by counting the number of individ-\nual polluting events (Bello, Mydlarz, and Salamon 2018). It\ncan also be used in music content analysis (J. Humphrey,\n*corresponding author.\nCopyright © 2024, Association for the Advancement of Artificial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.Durand, and McFee 2018). Despite its importance, research\non sound counting has far lagged behind than its well-\nestablished crowd counting counterparts from either im-\nages (Zhang et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2019), video (Li, Zhang,\nand Chen 2018) or joint audio-visual (Hu et al. 2020).\nWe conjecture the lack of exploration stems from three\nmain factors. First, sound counting has long been treated\nas an over-solved problem by sound event detection (SED)\nmethods (Mesaros et al. 2021; Cakir et al. 2017; Adavanne,\nPertil ¨a, and Virtanen 2017; He, Trigoni, and Markham\n2021), in which SED goes further to identify each sound\nevent’s ( e.g.a bird call) start time, end time and semantic\nidentity. Sound counting number then becomes easily ac-\ncessible by simply adding up all detected events. Secondly,\ncurrent SED only tags whether a class of sound event is\npresent within a window, regardless of the number of con-\ncurrent sound sources of the same class like a series of baby\ncrying or multiple bird calls (Phan et al. 2022). Thirdly, la-\nbelling acoustic data is technically-harder and more time-\nconsuming than labelling images, due to the overlap of con-\ncurrent and diverse sources. The lack of well-labelled sound\ndata in crowded sound scenes naturally hampers research\nprogress. Existing SED sound datasets (Adavanne, Pertil ¨a,\nand Virtanen 2017; Heittola et al. 2010) capture simple\nacoustic scenarios with low polyphony and where the event\nvariance is small. The simplified acoustic scenario in turn\nmakes sound counting task by SED methods tackleable. But\nwhen the sound scene becomes more complex with highly\nconcurrent sound events, SED methods soon lose their ca-\npability in discriminating different sound events (Pankajak-\nshan, Bear, and Benetos 2019; Cakir et al. 2017). In the\nmeantime, some researchers think sound counting is equiv-\nalent to sound source separation task (Neumann et al. 2020;\nTurpault et al. 2021; Tzinis, Wang, and Smaragdis 2022;\nSubakan et al. 2022; Tzinis et al. 2020), in which the sound\nis counted as the source number by isolating individual\nsound from sound mixture and assigning it to correspond-\ning sound source.
