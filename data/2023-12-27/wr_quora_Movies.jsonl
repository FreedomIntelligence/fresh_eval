The movie is filled with explicit scenes and violence. For example there are scenes where the lead character played by Ranbir kills almost a 100 men, in a gorey over the top way. There are scenes with Rashmika where Ranbir try to establish his perspective about Manliness and the whole Alpha male narrative on her. There are instaces where he cross the line and has a extramarital affair with another woman. All these things were against my morality.That been said, coming to the question,\n\nDo you think the \"animal\" movie is sending a bad message to society?\n\nBefore answering this question let me tell you a story. Trust me it will make sense in the end. So bear with me.\n\nOnce there was a man who used to drink alot. He used to drink day and night. And on getting drunk he used to physically abuse his wife and two children. Everyday the father did this and made a living hell for his family. Years passed and the two kids of the man grew up. The First boy became a drunk just like his father. When asked about this, the man replied, my father was a big drunkard. He abused me and my mother. And I grew up watching this. So obviously me also gonna end up like my father right? I became like this because of my father. When same was asked to the second man, he replied, I never touched alcohol in my life. I grew up watching my dad beat my mom and my brother after he gets drunk. Alcohol ruined our life. So I decided that day itself that, I will never touch alcohol in my life.\n\nNow look at the story. Two boys grown in same situation yet both chose to be different. One boy took tge situation negatively while the other in a positive sense.Cinema is just like this only. Ofcourse it is a good media to give messages to society, but it doesn't mean it will or have to give good messages. Some people tends to show their upbringings and tries to blame it on cinema.Cinema is a source of entertainment in the end. It is upto the viewers to take their stance. Like the boys from the story. You have the power to let it influence you or not.\n\nDoes animal put forwards a bad message to the society? Ofcourse it does! Because it's a story about a disturbed man with mental issues. He will do things based on his mental state and narrow perspective. And the movie is rated A for a reason. You don't expect devotional things from an adult movie right?\n\nI don't see anybody complaining about the morality in a adult web series like this.\n\nSo what's so special about animal? Just because it has big actors in it, the movie is not liable to a good messaging to society. In the end you are seeing a vision of a director and you always have an option to not see it or not.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n‡¥®‡¥®‡µç‡¥¶‡¥ø ü´¥üïäÔ∏è"}

For \"The Whale,\" Fraser went through an intensive makeup process, wearing a fat suit that looked extremely realistic. The suit was designed to make his character‚Äîa reclusive English teacher suffering from severe obesity‚Äîappear as authentic as possible.\n\nThe transformative makeup and fat suit took hours to apply each filming day. I mean, it‚Äôs part and parcel of the craft, right? These days, performances aren‚Äôt just about getting inside a character's head.

When your team is organized and connected, you can improve productivity, reduce ‚Äúwork about work\n‚Äù like ineffective meetings and email bloat, and do better work.\n\nSo if you‚Äôre looking to avoid the roadblocks that hinder productivity for even the best of teams, look no further. Here are eight tips for improving team organization and connection and‚Äîin turn‚Äîboosting both the speed and quality of your team‚Äôs work:\n\nEliminate unnecessary meetings\n\nMeetings are productive if and when there‚Äôs a clear agenda, the right people attend, and everyone is prepared to contribute to a solution. However, if this isn‚Äôt the case, even short meetings can add up and eat into time your team has to work toward tangible goals.\n\nTo avoid that, share a meeting agenda\n in Asana beforehand so everyone is on the same page. Create sections where collaborators can ask async questions and identify the work that‚Äôs most important to talk about. After the meeting, identify action items within the same Asana project, so no work falls through the cracks.\n\nPrioritize work based on key results\n\nEmployees have many important tasks across multiple projects, but it can be hard for team members to know where they should devote the bulk of their time and brainpower. With Asana custom fields\n, assign each task a priority or status level. That way team members can prioritize work that ladders up to company-wide objectives.\n\nHaving a well-defined set of goals and clear understanding of how work ladders up to those goals\n will empower team members to make decisions that impact the big picture. And, if a project isn‚Äôt connected to a larger company goal, rethink whether it‚Äôs necessary or not in the first place.\n\nDelete, defer, delegate, or diminish\n\nAsana surveyed over 10,000 global workers to find out how we really spend our time at work\n. We found that a surprisingly small portion of the day actually goes toward skilled work and big-picture planning. To eliminate the busywork standing between you and substantive tasks, remember the four D‚Äôs:\n\nIf an aspect of a project does not support an overarching company goal‚Äîdelete it.\nIf there is a more pressing project that has a greater impact on team goals, complete that task and defer a less important task for when you have more time.\nIf there are two tasks of equal importance assigned to one person, delegate one of those tasks to another team member with more bandwidth.\nIf there‚Äôs a task you can‚Äôt defer, delete, or delegate, find ways to diminish the amount of time it takes to complete. For example, you can eliminate related meetings or work on just the highest priority parts of the task.\n\nLeverage your team‚Äôs strengths\n\nNo two employees are alike. Each person has different experiences, strengths, and weaknesses that make them a valued member of your team. When assigning work, be sure each individual‚Äôs task is one they are not only suited for, but also will enjoy completing. Giving your team tasks they find personally rewarding or challenging can help everyone to do their best work.\n\nAdditionally, proactively identify and prevent burnout so your team is always doing their best work. Workload\n allows team members to assign time or capacity to tasks, so you can preemptively address overwork. Reassign tasks and rebalance responsibilities to make sure your team gets the right work done at the right time.\n\nMap out a plan before beginning\n\nOnce you know what needs to be done and who will do it, you then need to define a well-thought plan that can eliminate ‚Äúwork about work,‚Äù like status updates and email bloat. Start by establishing a clear timeline for each project, and make sure everyone knows who‚Äôs doing what by when.\n\nUsing a work management tool can help you set up all of the smaller tasks that lead to accomplishing a larger goal. Making use of existing or custom templates\n in Asana can help you replicate a process that‚Äôs worked before and be certain nothing slips through the cracks.\n\nEncourage cross-functional collaboration\n\nJust because you work in a different department doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt work together. After all, you‚Äôre working toward the same goal as part of a larger company. Knowing what other teams are working on can encourage teams to collaborate\n with one another when work and goals overlap.\n\nWork management tools can increase cross-team visibility, mapping each phase of a project back to a singular set of goals. These tools can serve as a centralized hub to share what you‚Äôre working on with the rest of the team and identify areas where people of different responsibilities can collaborate.\n\nPromote no-meeting days\n\nMeetings can disrupt your flow, making it harder to ‚Äúget in the zone‚Äù and finish a project. Having at least one full day devoted to deep work‚Äîthat sweet, sweet block of several uninterrupted hours‚Äîcan go a long way toward improving efficiency and productivity.\n\nAt Asana, we have No Meeting Wednesday, which allows everyone to be heads-down in work instead of just talking about work. As a result, the team has more time to execute critical processes on projects. Many employees cite No Meeting Wednesday as their favorite day of the week and often see projects cross the finish line on Hump Day.\n\nAlternatively, give your team more freedom to set their own deep work blocks with Asana features like Do Not Disturb\n. Notify your team that you‚Äôre working but not receiving notifications, and keep clear lines of communication open.\n\nDefine the purpose of different communication channels\n\nCommunication tools are only useful if your team knows how and when to use them. Using them inconsistently or having multiple channels for the same use can actually create more confusion and inefficiency than the tools were meant to eliminate in the first place.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to clearly define the purpose of each communication channel. For example, this is how we use communication tools at Asana:\n\nFor outside communication with vendors and clients, stick to email.\nFor immediate answers to questions, use an app like Slack\n.\nTo plan, manage, and communicate about actionable work, stick to a work management tool like Asana\n.\n\nImproving team collaboration and connection increases productivity\n\nImproving productivity is a continuous process. It may seem overwhelming, but simple organization tools and collaboration tactics can help make everyone on your team more connected‚Äîand more efficient. Learn more about how Asana\n can help make you and your team be more efficient, and try Asana for free today."}

But when it comes to the variation in human body types, particularly the lack of heavier-set humans, there's a noticeable absence. Why is that?\n\nFor starters, the \"Star Wars\" series has always been a sort of space opera, with its roots in mythology and classic storytelling. The heroes and villains are often depicted in ways that are meant to be archetypal, larger-than-life characters, and physicality plays a big part in that portrayal. There's a tendency in visual storytelling to represent heroes and villains in physically idealized forms ‚Äî this often translates into fit and muscular protagonists and antagonists, giving them a larger-than-life presence.\n\nNow, practical considerations also come into play. By the time the original trilogies were being filmed, special effects were nowhere near what they are today. So, actors had to do their own stunts more frequently, and being fit was often a practical requirement of the job. Han Solo ducking laser blasts? Luke Skywalker swinging across chasms? You better believe they needed to be in top shape for those scenes.\n\nPlus, think about the contexts in which we see humans in the \"Star Wars\" universe. Many of them are soldiers, Jedi, or adventurers, constantly on the move and often in survival situations where food might be scarce and physical demands are high. This lifestyle doesn't lend itself well to sedentary living or over-consuming calories ‚Äî there isn't much room for a Dagobah fast-food chain in the swamps where Yoda lives.\n\nAnd let's not forget about selective storytelling. \"Star Wars\" focuses primarily on people directly involved in the action ‚Äî the front-line fighters of the Rebellion, the agile and disciplined Jedi, the menacing figures of the Empire. We don't get a snapshot of what the average civilian in a galaxy far, far away looks like or what their lifestyle entails. For all we know, there are plenty of diverse body shapes and sizes that we simply don't see on screen because they're not integral to the central plot.\n\nBut consider this as well, storytelling has historically followed patterns. In traditional epic tales, and indeed in many modern ones, there is often an emphasis on the physical prowess of the heroes. These standards shape our expectations for the genre, sometimes at the expense of diversity, both on screen and off.\n\nSure, more recent \"Star Wars\" media, like the TV series \"The Mandalorian,\" have started to show a wider range of human shapes and sizes, but there's still a long way to go. It's a reminder that even in a galaxy with limitless potential for diversity, our own world's biases can seep into the way we create and consume media.\n\nAs Scott, living in the green and often rain-drenched lands of Portland, OR, my take is that \"Star Wars\" is still a product of its time and cultural context, just as much as it is a look into a diverse fictional universe. And as we continue to broaden our understanding of representation, maybe we'll begin to see more of that diversity reflected in the body types of human characters across the galactic spectrum."}

He is now almost 50 years old, and I am happy to say that he has the typical look of an almost 50-year-old man. In fact, he is a quite attractive man of almost 50 years. You may like boyish looking guys more, but to me, DiCaprio is much more attractive now than he was 20 or 30 years ago. I am your same age.\n\nOkay, it's true that he has gained a little weight, but so do most of us. Still, he hasn't gained much weight, just a little. Marlon Brando also had the same youthful looks and the charm and freshness of a young man, but by the time he starred in Apocalypse Now, he was only a little older than DiCaprio is today, and he was so fat that he could barely move around the filming set. And yet, he managed to retain most of his charisma and charm.\n\nIf you push me, I would say that a little extra fat under the skin is beneficial when you are not so young anymore. There are three main ways to prevent wrinkles at age 50: good genetics (something you either have or you don't have, and it's clear that DiCaprio doesn't seem to have it, but he also doesn't have ruined skin like, for example, Robert Redford's when was the same age). DiCaprio does not appear to have undergone many cosmetic interventions on his face (the second option to eliminate wrinkles). He indeed has some lines on his forehead and a bit of crow's feet around his eyes, but not many, just enough to give him an interesting look. The last option to prevent excess wrinkles is when the skin is filled from within, that is, thanks to body weight, and as long as DiCaprio does not gain more weight, his current appearance is more than acceptable.\n\nThe problem is that the actor has been appearing on screens since he was a child, and we have seen him playing roles since then, which affects our perception. It seems like it was just yesterday that he filmed ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Eating Gilbert Grape‚Äù almost in his late teens, but in reality it has been almost 30 years."}

Harris was so furious that he punched Cameron in the face. To this day, he refuses to discuss the making of the film.\n\n**plot spoilers ahead**\n\nMastrantonio had to film a resuscitation scene in which she was soaking wet, her breasts were exposed, and Harris was pounding on her chest and slapping her in the face repeatedly, and Cameron kept demanding retake after retake. Finally, she had an emotional breakdown, stormed off the set, and refused to return if he didn‚Äôt just wrap the scene already, saying, ‚Äúwe are not animals!‚Äù She, like Harris, is not fond of discussing her experience during filming.\n\nStanley Kubrick was another director who, although brilliant, was notorious for being difficult, exacting, and highly demanding.\n\nWhile filming ‚ÄúThe Shining‚Äù, Kubrick was notoriously hard on his cast, most notably Scatman Crothers and especially Shelley Duvall. Duvall was so stressed out during the shoot due to endless retakes and near-constant verbal abuse from Kubrick that she became physically ill and her hair began to fall out. Kubrick also insisted that everyone else on set not be sympathetic toward Duvall, claiming it would hurt her performance. Costar Jack Nicholson would later say he thought Duvall‚Äôs role was the toughest he had ever seen an actress take on, and Kubrick himself also highly praised her performance after the film had wrapped. Duvall, for her part, conceded that Kubrick was probably trying to get her best out of her, but also thought it unfair that Kubrick received all the praise for the finished film, and said it felt ‚Äúlike I wasn‚Äôt even there.‚Äù\n\n69-year-old Crothers, who played cook Dick Hallorann, was also pushed hard. In one scene, Kubrick demanded over 100 takes from him, until Crothers broke down in tears and asked him, ‚ÄúMr. Kubrick, just what do you want from me?‚Äù Nicholson was finally able to convince Kubrick to ease up on Crothers. It‚Äôs said that when Crothers made his next film, ‚ÄúBronco Billy,‚Äù directed by Clint Eastwood - as notoriously easygoing a director as Kubrick was difficult - he again burst into tears: this time of joy, when he realized that he wouldn‚Äôt have to do dozens of takes for each scene. (Incidentally, Kubrick had originally wanted Slim Pickens for the role of Hallorann, but Pickens, having appeared in Kubrick‚Äôs film ‚ÄúDr. Strangelove‚Äù, outright refused to work with him again.)\n\nOn the other hand, some directors who are known to be easy to work with and well liked by actors, in addition to Eastwood, include Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Tim Burton, and Ang Lee."}

Here's an overview of how actors approach kissing scenes:\n\nClear Communication: Before filming intimate scenes, actors typically have a meeting with the director and each other to discuss boundaries, comfort levels, and the overall vision for the scene. This helps establish trust and ensures that everyone is on the same page.\nConsent and Boundaries: Actors have the right to establish boundaries and communicate what they are comfortable with during intimate scenes. This may include specifying the intensity of the kiss, the duration, or any specific actions they are not comfortable performing.\nClosed Set: Filming intimate scenes is often done on a closed set with minimal crew members present. This helps create a more private and comfortable environment for the actors.\nProfessionalism: Actors approach kissing scenes with a high level of professionalism. They understand that it's part of their job and is meant to convey a certain emotion or narrative, rather than being a personal experience.\nRehearsals: Just like any other scene, kissing scenes are rehearsed to ensure that the actors and the director are satisfied with the performance. This helps in blocking out the scene, determining camera angles, and making sure that everyone is comfortable with the choreography.\nUse of Body Doubles: In some cases, body doubles may be used for certain parts of intimate scenes. This allows the actors to maintain a level of comfort while still achieving the desired visual effect.\nSpecial Effects: Sometimes, special effects may be used to enhance or simulate a kissing scene. This could involve camera angles, lighting, or other techniques that create the illusion of a kiss without the actors making physical contact.\nProfessional Advice: Actors may seek advice from intimacy coordinators or directors who specialize in filming intimate scenes. These professionals can provide guidance on choreography, communication, and creating a safe environment on set.\n\nOverall, the key is to prioritize the well-being and comfort of the actors involved while ensuring that the scene effectively communicates the intended emotion or story. Clear communication, respect for boundaries, and a collaborative approach are crucial in handling kissing scenes in a professional manner."}

Unfortunately, while she was in the rainforest, Judd had a major accident.\n\nJudd tripped over a fallen tree in the dark, which resulted in a devastating leg injury.

His first iteration would be about the Ark, which he had learned about from, of all people, his dentist.\n\nHe was at the beach with Spielberg, and they were building a sandcastle while talking about the film business.\n\nWhile working on this sandcastle, Lucas pitched his idea to Spielberg, describing his concept of a James Bond-like character who was a rough and tumble archaelogist. He described the opening scene of the movie, that was meant to have a King Kong like feel.\n\nSpielberg loved the idea but suggested he change the name from Indiana Smith to Indiana Jones as it would have a better ring to it.\n\nAs they continued to work on the sand castle, Lucas then asked him to sign on to do the film, under the condition that he did all 3 (Lucas loved doing trilogies).

According to Michael Douglas, Winger was initially set to co-star in the film but lost the role to Kathleen Turner due to a bizarre biting incident.\n\nIt all started when Douglas and Winger decided to have a few tequilas with their dinner. As they stepped outside, Douglas playfully punched Winger on her arm, resulting in her retaliating by biting him.

She didn't quite have the same meteoric career as she transitioned into more mature roles. In fact, she only made a handful of movies as an adult.\n\nHer adult film career had about five films, a stark contrast to the 20 or so hit films she made as America's little darling in the 1930s. Among these, some of the more notable titles include \"The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer\" and \"That Hagen Girl,\" both of which were released when she was in her late teens. As the years rolled on, her presence on the silver screen quivered and waned.\n\nWhat's even more fascinating about Shirley Temple is how she redefined herself after Hollywood. She embarked on a path that led her to become an ambassador, serving in Ghana and later in Czechoslovakia. Her story is a powerful reminder that the limelight of Hollywood can be just one act of an individual's life, not the defining feature.\n\nShirley Temple Black, as she was known in her political career, lived a life that surpassed the glow of her curly-haired, dimpled cheek persona that pirouetted into the hearts of a nation.

So they prefer to let someone else handle the details while they live their lives.\n\nFinancial advisors also understand taxes, retirement funds, and other aspects of the financial system far better than the average person, which can save quite a bit every year all on its own.\n\nFrom what I‚Äôve personally seen, affluent people generally network between themselves to find the best financial advisors. So if you have any well off friends, start there.\n\nComparison sites like WiserAdvisor\n can also help you find someone near you who has good reviews and a track record of success.\n\nThis form\n saves you some time by connecting you with advisors who specialize in your preferences, portfolio size, etc.\n\nHope that helps."}

I had one guy who tried to rape an escort in a hotel. She fought back. In his haste to leave he left his car keys on the hotel nightstand. The client left the room, she locked the door, he pleaded with her to hand the keys over, she said ‚Äúf*ck off!‚Äù, perp ran away and the victim gave the keys to the responding police. Cops used the fob to locate the car, tag came back to my guy and the rest is history.\n\nThe thing I cannot understand is how many criminals bring their cell phones with them to crime scenes. People‚Ä¶c‚Äômon! Police can get records for all numbers in an area for a specific time and trace the numbers to possible suspects. Kinda makes that whole defense of ‚ÄúI was nowhere near there‚Äù go right out the window."}

They‚Äôre the daughters of King Triton, making them all princesses of Atlantica. That‚Äôs a lot of royal blood floating around.\n\nThey don‚Äôt all get a huge amount of screen time in \"The Little Mermaid,\" but they play bigger roles in some of the straight-to-video sequels and the prequel. Seems like a missed opportunity to not explore those relationships more. Being part of a big family can be pretty interesting, especially with the dynamics that come into play.\n\nGrowing up in Portland, OR, surrounded by the majesty of the Pacific Northwest's own waters, I sometimes imagine what it'd be like to have a family that big... or fins for that matter. I suspect there'd be a lot less room for the serene solitude I find hiking the lush trails of Forest Park or strolling down the banks of the Willamette River.\n\nBut hey, if I had a voice like Ariel's sisters, I‚Äôm not sure I could resist belting out tunes near the ocean, even if it‚Äôs just the salty breeze from the Oregon Coast instead of the warm currents of the Caribbean."}

If I had to place Dunki in the list of Rajkumar Hirani movies, you know where I would place it?\n\n3 idiots\nMunna Bhai\nLage Raho Munna bhai\nSanju\nPK\nDunki\n\nWhy you may ask? This doesn‚Äôt look like Hirani movie at all. The script is poor. I mean poorer than a avg Indian movie.\n\nI can‚Äôt even digest Shahrukh‚Äôs aged look. And post hate comments I don‚Äôt care. Srk does over acting in most of his movies.\n\nAverage acting by Tapsee.\n\nVicky Kaushal had a small role however he excelled it.\n\nThe movie has a couple of funny scenes where we laugh and a couple of funny scene where only the characters laugh.\n\nSomewhere I feel Raju Hirani has modified the script of Munna Bhai Chale America and tried to fit its scenes in this movie.\n\nI was a kid when Munnah Bhai chale America‚Äôs trailer was launched. The entire trailer was focused on language issue and humour associated in language issues.\n\nI was kind of supporting this movie having more screens than Salaar because it‚Äôs a Raju Hirani movie, SRK movie and all but after watching it I feel this movie doesn‚Äôt deserve such a screen share.\n\nIf you like this movie, it‚Äôs ok for me. If I don‚Äôt like this movie, is it ok for you?"}
