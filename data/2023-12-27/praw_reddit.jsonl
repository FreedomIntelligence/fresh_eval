Daydreamers absolutely never have a zip for closure, their should never be a middle inner zip neither, it should always be magnetic!\n2. If there's pockets inside they should always be a gold or silver very defined pocket. ( the zip pocket should always read shop!) Never red writing.\n3. If there's a heart mirror connected to a strap it should read ' I am the fairest' with the I underlined ( although I have seen some fakes with the I underlined ) again never red writing! Some of the heart mirrors with the J were flat and not puffed up this is on the older juicy bags from around 2006, they are real!\n4. On the zippers there should always be ykk engraved on the zippers, ( although some of the older juicy bags 2004 didn't have the ykk on the zippers some of them!) \n5. The embroidery should be bang on and perfect!\n6. Some juicy bags did infact have silk bows!\n7. The bubbled love heart J at the back should be puffy and defined ( not like the fake photo on here )\nSome daydreamers didn't have the shop pockets, mirror and bubbled love heart J at the back ( doesn't mean their fake)\n8. The hardware on the older juicy bags should be quite dull, the bag charms are always bulky and quite heavy.\n9. Inside the juicy label their should always be some sort of code inbetween ( although the ones from 2004 to 2008 were either steamed stickered in or stapled in so sometimes they can fall out. \n10. The newer juicy bags ( last photos ) there not real leather and they look cheaply made but still authentic.\n11. Older daydreamer bags to 2010 are always mostly 100% cotton lining.\n\nIf you go through the photos you can really tell the difference between the fake and real ones.\n\nHope this helps someone out, im sorry if it's not the best I'm not to good at explaining things.\nIf in doubt always do you research, or you can simply private message me üòä\n\nKeep it juicy üíñ"}
