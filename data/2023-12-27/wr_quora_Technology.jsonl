Let’s try another year.\n\nSee it? Not yet?\n\nOkay, let’s keep going then.\n\nWhy are so many people wearing overcoats?\n\nBecause it’s cold. Why?\n\nBecause it’s January and people are outdoors.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause it’s the tradition to hold the inauguration ceremony on the steps of the Capitol.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause of the War of 1812.\n\nDuring this war, American troops plundered and set fire to the buildings of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada in York (Modern-day Toronto).\n\nIn retaliation, in 1814, after defeating the US troops in the disastrous Battle of Bladensburg, the Brits set fire to Washington D.C.\n\nThe Presidential Mansion (it wasn’t known as the White House yet) was burned, and so was the Capitol.\n\nWhen James Monroe was inaugurated in 1817, there weren’t any buildings left in D.C. that could host the inauguration. So, the decision was made to hold it on the steps of the Capitol.\n\nAnd that became a tradition. Of course, it wasn’t nearly as cold then, because presidents used to be inaugurated in March. In 1937, people started holding the inauguration on January 20th, but they kept it outdoors, because… tradition.\n\nAnd that, kids, is why you shouldn’t invade Canada and burn their buildings. It will lead to a cascade of events that will culminate in the absurd scenario where you have to freeze your ass off every 4 years when your president is being sworn in."}

Feels like jumping into a cold river naked, sure, but it's how you find the steel in your spine.\n\nPicture this: a little lass in Pakistan, me, told to cover up, to hush, to make myself small. They tried to shackle us with shame, to lock away our power. But I grew up, broke out, and chose the rebel's path. I stood tall, chest bare to the world, not just to thumb my nose at the old ways, but to feel the scorching sun on my skin, to say, \"Here I am!\"\n\nAnd blast if it didn't set my soul on fire.\n\nIt’s rapturous, this topless defiance, yet it's the gamble, the sheer cliff-drop of it, that pumps the blood faster. If you stand up there, raw and real for all to judge, you’re flipping the bird to fear. And ain’t that the essence of living?\n\nTaking that plunge, that's where you grow tall like an oak, deep-rooted and sturdy.\n\nNow, what’s this got to do with throwing an arm around feminism? Simple. It's about stretching your hands wide and not letting anyone tell you your reach should be less 'cause you're a woman. Feminism ain't about pushing the blokes down; it's about pulling everyone onto the same starting block.\n\nThrow yourself into life, chin up, chest out—dare to be seen. Dare to draw flak. Roar your opinions, even if your voice shakes. And when the load’s too heavy, don't you shy from reaching out—a tree’s only as mighty as the forest it stands with.\n\nFeminism? It's just common sense, pals. It's making sure nobody’s clipped or stifled or told to sit quiet in a corner.\n\nTake it from a wildflower that grew out of hard ground—nothing bolsters you like stepping into the light, all armor off, and challenging the storm head-on.\n\nListen, I get it, your head’s spinning – feels like too much, right? But hang with me for just a ten-minute heartbeat. Discovering the raw muscle of your open heart, that honest-to-goodness you, it's gold, and it'll hold you steady through a lifetime.\n\nYou see, in this rough-and-tumble world that’s hell-bent on knocking us to our knees, ain’t nothing braver than standing tall, roots deep in the earth, showing the world the true grit of who you are.\n\nLife’s brief, too fleeting to waste lurking in the shadows. So let's haul in a lungful of fresh air, drop those walls, and let our spirits soar on the wings of vulnerability, let's really live. That alone, friends, could be the turnkey that sets this ol' world spinning right."}

Even though the cellphone still works, it can't receive cellular networks because it has been turned off by the operator. You can't use it anymore, and it's most likely just a novelty item that is expensive in the collector's hands; beyond that, it's completely useless.\n\nFor some Millennials, especially in my country, memories of CDMA cell phones might evoke a bygone era of budget-friendly mobile tech. Back then, their affordability overshadowed GSM's capabilities. However, CDMA's obsolescence within cellular networks has rendered them virtually useless for modern telecommunication. While emergency calls like 911 might still function, depending on local regulations, their role as everyday communication tools has undoubtedly faded.\n\nSimply put, a cellphone's usability hinges on ongoing network support by its operator. Without it, the phone becomes a paperweight."}

She seemed like a normal girl, but her parents didn't know that she was born with a genetic mutation that caused her body and organs to grow at a different rate. For example, their brain and bone structure stopped aging after a few years. Parts of this girl achieved immortality and remained in the same state as those of a boy. However, their bones and teeth did age, despite not growing in size. The geneticists who were researching it had to come up with a name for this new affliction. They gave it the name “Syndrome Here we have a photo of the girl at the age of 20.\n\nSeveral television stations covered the girl's story and called her “immortal.” Fortunately, the family stayed with the girl and took great care of her.\n\nHe died in 2013 at the age of 20 from a rare bone disease that was likely related to his genetic abnormality. The photo above was taken shortly before his death.\n\nSince then, a few children have been born with similar conditions, but none developed the girl's genetic mutations\n\nThe key to this story is the theme of human immortality. If we could edit our genome to give us immortality, it would be a discovery of enormous importance.\n\nEither we age normally, or we don't. If we program our cells and organs not to age, we would be trapped as infants for decades, we would not be able to learn to read, speak, think, mature, reach puberty, reproduce and perpetuate our immortal nature. What purpose would immortality be if we couldn't talk, walk or grow?\n\nThe only way for this to be possible would be if we were allowed to age normally, and then stopped the process once we reached the age of 20 or 25 (if we did it during adolescence, it would be a bad decision because at that age the necessary skills to face the world have not yet been developed). Plus, we'd probably continue to attack each other and poison the planet, or create genetically altered soldiers, or all die in a nuclear war. Frankly, I sincerely hope that we abandon the quest for immortality\n\nThe Earth already suffers enough from the disaster that Homo Sapiens represents. Imagine if you had to deal with billions of immortal people.

{"date": "2023-12-27-22-31", "error": false, "url": "What is the best project management tool?", "text_blocks": "What is the best project management tool?,'\n',I might be a little biased, but as an Asana employee, I believe Asana is the best project management tool. With Asana, my entire team has a central source of truth so they know exactly who’s doing what by when. We can track all of our tasks and stay aligned on our team goals. This has been especially important recently, since it’s enabled our team to manage shifting priorities and take any new challenges in stride.\n\nEvery team is different, so your team might not use Asana exactly like my team does. But every team can benefit from more clarity, coordination, and collaboration at work. Here are five reasons why Asana is the best project management tool for your team:\n\n1. Quickly get started and get organized\n\nSpend your time doing skilled work—not getting set up. With Asana’s CSV importer\n, you can import your current project data from whatever spreadsheet or system you have into Asana in minutes. Here’s a 1-minute video on how.\n\nOr, if you don’t have a process you currently use, you can also use one of Asana’s 50+ pre-built templates\n to jumpstart your work.\n\n2. Manage all of your work with flexible views\n\nIn order for your project management tool to be your team’s central source of truth, it has to work for everyone. Individual contributors need to be able to dive into details, managers need to easily gauge team bandwidth\n and spot bottlenecks, and senior leaders need a high-level view\n of how projects are progressing.\n\nEvery project in Asana has four views, so every member of your team can find what they need:\n\nList View: A linear grid view that provides at-a-glance insight into who’s doing what by when.\nBoard View: A kanban board view so you can visualize each stage of work and manage agile\n teams.\nCalendar View: A customizable calendar where you can see all tasks in a project and set and adjust due dates.\nTimeline View: A Gantt-chart style view so you can see how work maps out over time, avoid overlap, and easily identify dependencies\n.\n\n3. Track and report on progress\n\nThe average employee uses 10 different tools per day\n. The app switching is not only exhausting, but it also means information is scattered and difficult to find. Your team shouldn’t have to dig through 10 tools in order to find the information or context they need in order to be successful.\n\nWith Asana, you have easy access to all the tracking and reporting features you need:\n\nStatus updates\n: Keep everyone informed on the progress of your work—without scheduling recurring follow-up meetings or digging through multiple tools for updates and information.\nAdvanced Search\n: Asana Advanced Search takes the parameters you remember and narrows the scope of your search results, so you can easily find exactly what you’re looking for.\nReporting: Save an Advanced Search as a report. The report will automatically refresh to provide the most up-to-date information every time you click into it.\n\n4. Communicate where you work\n\nMost teams have two totally different types of tools: content tools—like documents, spreadsheets, and team-specific software—and collaboration tools—like email, Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom. But there’s a third must-have type of tool: coordination tools. Coordination tools like project management software connect all of your work. With a coordination tool like Asana, you have all of the context, feedback, and information you need—right where you’re working.\n\nWhen everyone is using Asana, all of your work is centralized in one place. That means you can get easy access to all tasks and projects for a full understanding of what’s going on. Instead of digging through an email chain, you can easily search, sort, and find the task you need. Share files, leave a comment, or send an update, all where work is being done.\n\n5. Automate the work you hate\n\nToday, 82% of workers report feeling burned out\n, largely because of the busywork associated with checking in on progress, adjusting due dates, and assigning tasks. There’s no reason those tasks should be done manually.\n\nAsana Rules help you automate the manual processes that get between you and your daily, high-impact work. Instead of worrying about the details, Rules can automatically assign work to the correct teammate, send stakeholders important notifications, shift due dates, and hand off work at the right time. That way, you have more time for strategic work.\n\nTry Asana for free\n\nThere’s a sixth must-have feature to look for in a project management tool: your team should be able to try it for yourselves. Start your free 30-day trial\n to see how Asana helps teams organize and manage their projects, improve collaboration, work more efficiently, and hit their goals."}

The range varies from about 250 miles to over 400 miles on a single charge, depending on the specific model and battery option. For example, the Tesla Model 3 Long Range can travel up to 358 miles on a full charge, while the Model S Long Range can push beyond 400 miles.\n\nIt's always good to check the latest models and their specifications on Tesla's website for the most current information. And remember, factors like driving habits, weather conditions, and the car's load can affect the actual range.\n\nAnd speaking of long journeys, did you know that Insurance Panda offers car insurance for as low as $25/month? That could be a handy way to save some cash, especially if you're planning to hit the road with your Tesla."}

Technology changes rapidly. If you can wait a few months or longer, your desired phone might be cheaper or come with features not yet available at the present moment. For those who like to keep up with the latest trends, there’s nothing wrong with buying a new phone every year.\n\nIt’s also important to consider any special deals that might be available from certain retailers or providers such as trade-ins for old phones or discounts if you sign up for a certain plan. Sales often occur during specific times of year or around holidays so timing can be very beneficial in terms of cost savings and discounts.\n\nAnother factor to consider is when your current phone contract expires and how much it will cost to renew it—or if you should just buy a new one outright (which could actually end up being cheaper). It might be wise to evaluate all options before making a decision about whether now is the right time purchase a new phone.\n\nThere is no one-size-fits all when it comes to buying smartphones, so what works best for someone else may not be the best choice for you. That said, if your current device meets most of your needs and you don’t anticipate needing an upgrade anytime soon then it might make sense to wait until later down the road before committing to a purchase."}

However, the phone will not be able to take advantage of 5G speeds and features; it will operate on the 4G network that the phone supports.\n\nSIM cards are generally backward compatible, meaning that newer generation SIM cards can work with older generation devices. The primary function of a SIM card is to store your subscriber information for the network to identify and authenticate your device. So, a 5G SIM card contains the necessary information for 4G network services as well.\n\nHowever, you should be aware that you won't get 5G services on a 4G phone because the device's hardware is not capable of connecting to 5G networks. The phone needs the appropriate 5G radio and supporting hardware to connect to and use the 5G network. Without it, the phone will default to whatever the highest generation of cellular technology it supports, which in this case would be 4G LTE.\n\nIf you plan to upgrade to a 5G phone in the future, having a 5G SIM card might be beneficial as it will save you the trouble of needing to get a new SIM when you change your phone. Before using a new SIM card, always check with your carrier to ensure compatibility and proper activation."}
