He flourished around the 2nd century BC. He was a student of Apollonius of Perga [1]\n\nAgesistratus particularly focused on military fortifications and the construction of war machines. He wrote the work \"Siege Machines,\" specifically referring to \"greater catapults.\" Agesistratus constructed the largest catapult of antiquity, whose effective range of a 1.85 m long javelin reached 4 stades, about 750 m, literally piercing any shield with a breastplate carried behind it. It is believed that no other war machine of antiquity could surpass this range. It is noted that in a modern attempt to reconstruct this catapult, with a 0.88 m long arrow (as opposed to the javelin used by Agesistratus), the range did not exceed 375 m.

He was born in Mocsar, Hungary, in 1873, the son of Ignatz and Amalia Polachek. After arriving in the United States with only a pocket-full of change in 1892, Polachek began working at the William H. Jackson Company in Long Island City, Queens, New York City. He quickly climbed the ladder from laborer to [[ Construction foremanforeman]], eventually earning him favor with upper management. In 1903, he left William H. Jackson Co., and became a supervisor overseeing bronze manufacturing at the Tiffany Glass Studios in Corona, Queens New York, in which he further learned the trade of stonemasonry and metalworking. His employment with William H. Jackson Co. served as the foundation for his coming endeavors in bronze fabrication. Tiffany Glass Studios, which commonly referred to their product as ‘’’favrile glass or “Tiffany glass, would use bronze in their artisan work, particularly Tiffany lamps Polachek’s grand idea was to become the leader in the use of bronze for metal fabrication.\n\nPolachek foresaw the need for bronze with the impending worldwide expansion of bronze due to increased demand in the architectural and art world. Polacheck anticipated the use of bronze and sought the opportunity. The much-needed metal “bronze” occurred simultaneously with the rise of art-deco, art nouveau, and international movements, in which it was the cutting-edge style to use bronze. Polacheck’s intuition paid dividends finding this bonanza in the bronze fabrication trade.\n\nIn 1910, after saving enough money, Polachek left Tiffany Glass Studios and opened his own bronze architectural company in a loft, called the John Polacheck Bronze Company. But three months later, the two banks in which he deposited his money went bankrupt, and he borrowed $400 to pay his workers and meet his payroll. He slowly saved his money again, and opened his business in another loft. In 1912 he purchased a 1.75 acre site in Long Island City, Queens at 34-19 Tenth Street. He hired fifty men, and it grew to one of the most important bronze fabricators in the field. In 1923, The John Polachek Bronze Company grew exponentially, and he finally incorporated the new entity, giving twenty-two workers who had been managers (those men with him from the beginning in 1910), a share in the corporation. In 1927, Polacheck merged his new company with another metals fabricator, the Renaissance Bronze and Iron Works also located in Long Island City, Queens. The new company became known as the General Bronze Corporation. Polachek remained at General Bronze Corporation until 1934 as CEO. At the time of his retirement, General Bronze Corporation was the largest company in the architectural bronze industry in the United States, employing 600 workers with assets in excess of $5 million.\n\nLegendary General Bronze Corporation Projects[edit]\nAtlas in the International Building's plaza\nThe Seagram Building viewed from across Park Avenue at 52nd Street\n\nThe Seagram Building on New York City's Park Avenue remains the \"iconic glass box sheathed in bronze, designed by Mies van der Rohe.\"[1] To supply the demand for bronze required for the construction, the General Bronze Corporation fabricated 3,200,000 pounds (1,600 tons) at its plant in Garden City, New York.[2]\n\nView of the columns and bays at the lobby's northwestern corner\n\nIt was also known for New York City's Atlas[3] and Prometheus[3] bronze sculptures in Rockefeller Center, the bronze doors for the United States Supreme Court,[4] Commerce, and Department of Justice Buildings in Washington, DC,[5] the aluminum windows for the United Nations Secretariat Building[6][7] and Chase Manhattan Bank Building,<ref name=\"Chase Landmarks Commission\">\"ONE CHASE MANHATTAN PLAZA\" (PDF).

He played a key role in the founding of the organization and was actively involved in supporting a Konkani medium school. Mauzo was an experienced participant in the Konkani movement.\n\nCareer[edit]\nMauzo studio (1990–2023)[edit]\n\nMauzo Studio, located in Margao, Goa, gained recognition for its proprietor, Mauzo, who was known for his discreet and reserved approach to his work. Founded by Mauzo's father, R.N. Mauzo, in 1936, the studio has a long-standing history in the field of photography.[1] In 1945, it relocated to its current location in Margao. Originally named Mauzo Fotografo, the studio underwent a name change to Mauzo Studio and became the second photography establishment in Margao after Lords Photo Studio.[2] Following the passing of his father in 1990, Mauzo assumed the role of proprietor, ensuring the continuity of the studio's legacy.[3]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\n\nNarayan Ramnath Mauzo was born in either c. 1939 or c. 1940 in Goa, which was part of the Portuguese India and is now a part of the Republic of India. His father, R.N. Mauzo, gained acclaim as a photo artist and photographer. Mauzo's ancestral lineage in Goa runs deep, as he shares his name with his grandfather, Narayan \"Nani\" Mauzo, who was engaged in the tobacco trade during the period of Portuguese colonial rule and operated a modest shop in Margao's Old Market. Additionally, on his paternal side, Mauzo is also the first cousin of the artist Laxman Pai.[2] Mauzo entered into matrimony with Meena, and their union brought forth a son named Hiresh.[4]\n\nAwards[edit]\n\nMauzo held a distinct perspective on receiving awards during his life. Although he turned down the majority of accolades offered to him by different organizations, there was an exception. He made a decision to accept the \"Dnyanpithkar Ravindra Kelekar Konkani Language Award\" from the Directorate of Official Languages, Government of Goa, following persuasion from the Konkani community.[5] However, even prior to the award funds being transferred to his bank account, he generously donated the entirety of the amount to several other Konkani organizations.[6]\n\nOn 27 April 2016, Mauzo was honored at the 2015 Bhasha Puraskar Awards, where he was nominated for and ultimately won the \"Gyanpeeth Padmabhushan Late Ravindra Kelekar Bhasha Puraskar.\" This award recognized his contributions to the Konkani language.[7] The award included a monetary honorarium of Rs 1 lakh, a shawl, a manpatra (a formal letter of appreciation), and a memento. The ceremony took place at the Kala Academy and was attended by notable figures such as Milind Naik, the then-minister for Official Language, former deputy speaker Vishnu Wagh, and Padma Jaiswal, the Secretary of Official Language.[8]\n\nDeath[edit]\n\nOn 6 February 2023, Mauzo died at the age of 83 after a brief illness. The news of his demise brought about a sense of shock and grief among individuals associated with the Konkani movement.[5] The following day, Mauzo's funeral took place at the Mathagramasth Hindu Sabha Crematorium in Margao, where he was cremated according to Hindu traditions.[1]\n\nReactions[edit]\n\nAnwesha Singbal, the president of Konkani Bhasha Mandal (KBM), expressed profound sorrow over the loss of Mauzo. Singbal acknowledged his unwavering dedication to the Konkani movement and described him as an inspiration to young people. She emphasized that KBM would continue its important work, drawing strength from the legacy Mauzo left behind.[5]\n\nAftermath[edit]\n\nOn 19 February 2023, recognizing the significant contributions of Mauzo and another figure, Nagesh Karmali, the Konkani Bhasha Mandal organized a condolence meeting.[9]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b \"Konkani activist Narayan Mauzo dies at 83\".

Initially, Rossa only accompanied her mother for vocal tests (recordings) at the Pro-Sound studio, Jelambar, West Jakarta, but Rossa's prank on singing using headphones actually attracted the interest of Pro-Sound producer Mr. Budhy Paramita to make an album for her.[1]\n\nIn this album, Rossa, who was still a child, was directly handled by skilled senior musicians of her era such as Addie MS., James F. Sundah, Erwin Badudu, Arthur Kaunang, Franky Sahilatua, etc. It was a challenge in itself considering that they had to make children's songs that were different from usual. And Rossa was able to conquer songs that were quite difficult for the children's song category at that time. Unfortunately, this album, which was worked on optimally, was not successful in the market. It may be that this album is too heavy for children's consumption, but it is also suitable for teenagers and adults to enjoy. But even so, this album is a good start to Rossa's future career.\n\n“This album is not a profit-making project, but a prestige project. Just take a look, how many young singers are handled by so many famous musicians like this Rossa Rose album,\" said Mr. Budhy Paramita, Boss Pro-Sound, giving a comment. (Quoted from Ananda magazine 1991)\n\nRossa is different from child singers in general, her distinctive Lady Rocker-style voice with a very high pitch has been Rossa's trademark since she was little. When she was little, Rossa's singing style was heavily influenced by the music of Indonesian Lady Rockers such as Nicky Astria, Nike Ardilla, Anggun C. Sasmi, Lady Avisha etc., as well as western music such as Rolling Stone & Scorpion. She also received the nickname \"Little Rossa Rose\" or Little Lady Rocker because of her shrill voice.\n\nTrack listing[edit]\nBeri Kami Kesempatan (Ted Sutejo)\nGadis Ingusan (Areng Widodo)\nKe Jakarta (Areng Widodo)\nTetap Melangkah (Oetje F.

There it was resolved to form a committee to raise funds for a statue with Beckett agreeing to act as Honorary Secretary and Treasurer. At a subsequent meeting it was reported that Rupees 4,234 had been raised from donors, and it was resolved that the statue would be erected in the grounds of the British Consulate, Chiang Mai.[1]\n\nOn 23 July 1902, a bronze statue and base was ordered by the Borneo Company Limited, London from the Goldsmith and Siversmith Company, London, and a Mr. Cartwright was commissioned to create the statue at a cost of £250. The base was constructed of white Perak marble, supplied and engraved by Ravensway and Co., Singapore.[1]\n\nOn completion of the statue, the Ben Line company agreed to transport the statue from London to Singapore,[1] but fearing that the statue would not arrive in time for unveiling at Christmas, when a large gathering of traders in the town was expected, it was unloaded at Rangoon after a telegram was sent, and transferred overland, first by rail and then by porters, rafts and elephants, across the Shan States to Chiang Mai.[2][3]\n\nArriving in time, it was unveiled at a ceremony held on 24 December 1903 by Phya Surasri, the Siamese Commissioner of the Chiang Mai District in the presence of C.E.W. Stringer, the British Consul. On the base is inscribed the following words:\n\n\"Erected as a token of deep reverence and affection for the memory of their late Gracious Queen Victoria by her loyal subjects of every race residing in the Chiengmei, Lakon-Lampang, Phre, Nan, Sawankalok, and Raheng Districts of Northern Siam.\"[1][2]\n\nThe statue, it was said, was worshipped by Thais as a fertility goddess where religious offerings were placed, and during the Second World War, when it was protected inside a wooden box, two holes were made so the eyes could continue to look out at worshippers.[2]\n\nIt remained in the grounds of the British Consulate until 1978 when the building and land were sold, and the statue was moved to the Chiang Mai Foreign Cemetery.[2][3]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n \n\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d \"A Victoria Memorial\".

Berryman sought to develop something similar, suitable for a Protestant audience, incorporating existentialist theological concerns.\n\nBerryman and his colleague Sonja Stewart, a professor of Christian education at Western Theological Seminary, co-developed a series of lessons plans, the first of which were published in the book Young Children and Worship.[5] Berryman then further developed these ideas into the Godly Play method. The lesson plans were published as a series of books.\n\nTeachers are expected to be trained--and, ideally, certified--in the Godly Play method, in order to teach Godly Play. Some of the first Godly Play trainings were held on the campus of Virginia Theological Seminary.[3]\n\nAlthough there are apparent similarities in methodology and praxis, there are also key methodological and theological differences between the Catechesis of the Good Shepherd and Godly Play.[6]\n\nMethod[edit]\n\nAs with the Montessori method, the Godly Play method is child-centered and hands-on.[1] Led by trained teachers, children are guided through a series of lessons which teach the Bible, the church year, and the saints. The aim is to tap into the imagination and the religious potential of the child, as well as to attend to the child's existential limits.\n\nBerryman said, \"[a]t the heart of each lesson is storytelling and wondering\".[1] The lessons are taught as stories, illustrated with hands-on materials, which are followed by \"I wonder\" questions, then by time for students to creatively respond. Essential to the method is \"the idea that children have an innate sense of God\",[7] but \"only lack the language to express their spirituality\"[7]; Godly Play aims to address this lack, by providing the language, without interfering with the child's natural instincts.\n\nThe curriculum is taught in a classroom, which is specially prepared. Children are divided by age groups; each age group meets in a separate classroom, and is taught lessons in a scope and sequence tailored to their age group.\n\nResearch[edit]\n\nWork has been done to study Godly Play method and its impact through research and investigation. One collection of said studies is Godly Play — Gott im Spiel, edited by Martin Steinhäuser and Rune Oystese.[8]\n\nDerivatives[edit]\n\nThe method has inspired several derivatives, among them: Faith & Play Stories, for Quakers; and Spirit Play, for Unitarian Universalists.\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c Jerome W.

The petioles measure about 6 to 7 cm, slender, cylindrical, and prominently veined, leading to thick and rigid blades. These blades are roughly 1 to 1.5 dm long and 7 to 9 cm wide, taking an ovate shape with a sharply pointed and acute end. Their bases are either truncate or slightly heart-shaped, featuring a smooth edge. The upper side appears pale green, lightly rough to the touch, displaying sunken main veins, while the underside exhibits a gray hue, feels coarse, and displays prominent, sturdy veins. They boast a five-veined structure, with the lowest pair of veins notably weaker and connecting to others through a series of robust loops near the margin. All these veins interconnect via a loose yet sturdy network. The panicles emerge from the leaf axils, branching out from the base and displaying a loose structure. These branches are slender, with flowers either sitting directly on them or attached via very short, thick stalks. Only the staminate flower has been observed. The sepals are arranged in three rows, with the outer ones being quite small and almost fused, while the inner ones are about twice the size of the second row and might have slight fringes or fine hair-like structures. The six stamens are of equal size and appearance, separate from each other, and stand upright. Their filaments are stout, slightly wider towards the top, and carry anthers that are broader than they are long.\n\n[1]\n\n^ Henry, Rusby (1921–1922).

{"date": "2023-12-27-22-38", "error": false, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuta_acutifolia", "text_blocks": "Abuta acutifolia, commonly known as \"Abuta,\" is a perennial vine native to the Amazon rainforest in South America. Belonging to the Menispermaceae family, this plant has a rich history of traditional medicinal use among indigenous communities in the Amazon basin.\n\nThe Abuta vine is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that grow in an alternate pattern along the vine. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers typically bloom in clusters. The plant's fruits are small, spherical, and turn red when ripe. Abuta is known for its climbing habit, often winding its way up trees in its natural habitat.\n\nIn traditional Amazonian medicine, various parts of the Abuta plant, including the leaves, stems, and roots, have been utilized for their potential healing properties. Indigenous tribes have used Abuta to address a range of health issues, including menstrual problems, fevers, digestive disorders, and as a tonic for overall wellness.\n\nOne of the primary traditional uses of Abuta has been for women's health. It has been employed to ease menstrual discomfort, regulate menstrual cycles, and alleviate symptoms associated with menopause. Additionally, it has been used as a uterine tonic and to support reproductive health.\n\nIn modern times, Abuta has drawn attention from researchers and herbalists due to its potential medicinal properties. Some studies have explored its pharmacological compounds and their potential effects, including alkaloids and other bioactive constituents. However, further scientific research is necessary to validate and understand its therapeutic potential fully.\n\nAs with many medicinal plants from the Amazon rainforest, sustainable harvesting and conservation efforts are essential to protect the species and preserve its natural habitat. Overexploitation and deforestation pose significant threats to the existence of plants like Abuta.\n\nIn various parts of the world, including regions outside of South America, Abuta has gained attention among herbalists and alternative medicine practitioners. It is often available in the form of supplements, tinctures, or teas in health stores or online platforms catering to natural remedies.\n\nWhile traditional knowledge underscores its potential benefits, using Abuta or any herbal remedy should be done cautiously and preferably under the guidance of a healthcare professional. As with any herbal supplement, potential side effects, interactions with medications, and proper dosages should be considered before use.\n\nAbuta remains an intriguing botanical specimen, celebrated for its historical significance in traditional medicine and its potential therapeutic properties, prompting ongoing interest and exploration within the scientific community and herbal medicine practitioners alike.\n\nSee Also[edit]\n\nCategory:Lists of plant species"}

Bordering Switzerland, it represents the northernmost part of Val d'Ossola and Piedmont.[1][2][3][4]\n\nThe river Toce flows through the valley, forming the Toce waterfall. Seven hydroelectric reservoirs were built in the valley in the 20th century: lakes Morasco, Sabbione, Toggia, Vannino, Castel, Busin, and Sruer.[5][6][7][8]\n\nThe valley is surrounded by several three-thousander, the highest of which is the Blinnenhorn, followed by the Siedel Rothorn, Basòdino, Ofenhorn, Punta del Sabbione, Kastelhorn, Punta dei Camosci, Corno di Ban and Monte Giove. Ten mountain huts are located on its mountains.[9][10][11][12]\n\nTwo municipalities are located in the valley, Premia and Formazza, the latter of which is home to a Walser community.[13][14][15][16]\n\nMuch of the valley (22,233 hectares) is covered by a Special Protection Area as part of the Natura 2000 network.\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ VisitOssola\n^ Val Formazza\n^ Renato Armelloni, Alpi Lepontine: Sempione, Formazza, Vigezzo : Leone, Helsenhorn, Cervandone, Arbola, Blinnenhorn, Basòdino, Fiorera, Biela, Pioda, Pioda di Crana, Guida dei Monti d'Italia, n. 18\n^ Marco De Ambrosis, Marco Valsesia, Val Formazza: escursioni e itinerari per tutti, Zanetti, 2010\n^ VisitOssola\n^ Val Formazza\n^ Renato Armelloni, Alpi Lepontine: Sempione, Formazza, Vigezzo : Leone, Helsenhorn, Cervandone, Arbola, Blinnenhorn, Basòdino, Fiorera, Biela, Pioda, Pioda di Crana, Guida dei Monti d'Italia, n. 18\n^ Marco De Ambrosis, Marco Valsesia, Val Formazza: escursioni e itinerari per tutti, Zanetti, 2010\n^ VisitOssola\n^ Val Formazza\n^ Renato Armelloni, Alpi Lepontine: Sempione, Formazza, Vigezzo : Leone, Helsenhorn, Cervandone, Arbola, Blinnenhorn, Basòdino, Fiorera, Biela, Pioda, Pioda di Crana, Guida dei Monti d'Italia, n. 18\n^ Marco De Ambrosis, Marco Valsesia, Val Formazza: escursioni e itinerari per tutti, Zanetti, 2010\n^ VisitOssola\n^ Val Formazza\n^ Renato Armelloni, Alpi Lepontine: Sempione, Formazza, Vigezzo : Leone, Helsenhorn, Cervandone, Arbola, Blinnenhorn, Basòdino, Fiorera, Biela, Pioda, Pioda di Crana, Guida dei Monti d'Italia, n. 18\n^ Marco De Ambrosis, Marco Valsesia, Val Formazza: escursioni e itinerari per tutti, Zanetti, 2010"}

{"date": "2023-12-27-22-38", "error": false, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esquarre_(heraldry)", "text_blocks": "Esquarre (also escarre, Fr.)\n\nEsquarre (Fr., alternately escarre, esquierre[1]; as Anglo-Norman alternately esquarie, esquire, esquierre, esquerre[2]) is a name for both a heraldic ordinary[3] and a set of related mobile charges[4]. As an ordinary, the Esquarre is defined as a charge that borders a quarter (Fr. franc quartier, or a singular quarter as charge)[5] on its two interior edges abutting the field.[6] The Esquarre isolates the quarter from the rest of the field.[7] De Galway suggests that the Esquarre is employed when both quarter and field are the same tincture.[8] The shape of the ordinary is likened to a carpenter’s square, a tool formed of two arms joined perpendicularly.[9] When the two arms are of unequal length, the term potence (Fr.)[10] is also used, a term likening the form of this variant to a joined post and crossbeam, or gallows/scaffold.[11]\n\nEsquarre as mobile charge[edit]\n\nThe source of the term, a builders square, informs its use when referring to a mobile charge.[12][13] The term is an archaic form of the modern French équerre—the ‘square’ as implement used to measure or set right angles.[14][15] These are the tools employed by masons and carpenters, woodworkers, architects and engineers, surveyors, students, etc. They take the form of either (voided) triangles or two arms joined perpendicularly.[16] As a mobile charge, esquarre refers frequently to the figurative representations of these tools, as well as abstract versions (see #Gallery). Another term favored by some authors for the Esquarre is the gama grec (Fr.), from the Greek letter gamma.[17] This gives rise to another heraldic use: gama grec is applied to figurative representations of these implements, and in turn escarre is used to denote representations of the Greek letter gamma.[18][19]\n\nGallery[edit]\nCoats of arms and emblems[edit]\nAs mobile charge[edit]\nFigurative[edit]\nMasonic Square and Compass\n \nDistintive unit insignia of the 30th Engineer Battalion, US Army\nOn flags[edit]\nAs Ordinary[edit]\n\nMany contemporary flags approximate the classical or strict definition of the Ordinary, using a 'fillet esquarre' to border cantons and quarters, separating them from other charges as well as the field.\n\nThe second Flag of the former Soviet Union (1923–1924)\n \nFlag of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands\n \nFlag of the Namibian Police Force\n \nAir Force Ensign of South Africa (1994–2003)\n \nFormer flag of the State of Mississippi, USA (1894–2020, various hues)\n \nNaval Ensign of the former SFR Yugoslavia (1949–1993)\n \nFlag of Hœdic, Brittany, France\n \nNaval Ensign of South Africa (1959–1981)\n \nFlag of the State Council of Heraldry, Georgia\n \nFlag of Portland, Oregon\nAs Mobile Charge[edit]\nAbstract[edit]\nFlag of Lelystad, Flevoland, Netherlands\nFigurative[edit]\nBanner of the Bucharest Cooperative Society, 1882\n \nFlag of a Transylvanian Masons' Guild, 1852\n \nMasonic Flag, France\nAs letter[edit]\nFlag of the Silver Legion of America\n\nSee also the Flag of Lelystad, Flevoland, Netherlands (above)\n\nCharges in esquarre[edit]\nNaval Ensign of Bolivia\nSee also[edit]\n\tHeraldry portal\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Fillet crosses in heraldry.\n\nesquarre\nFillet (heraldry)\nOrdinary (heraldry)\nCharge (heraldry)\nFimbriation\nListe de pièces héraldiques\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ d'Argicourt, L.-A.

You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.\n\nYefim Dinitz\nBorn\tYefim Abramovich Dinitz\nOther names\tE. A. Dinic\nTitle\tEmeritus Full Professor[1]\n\nAcademic background\nAcademic advisors\tGeorgy Adelson-Velsky\nShimon Even\nAcademic work\nDiscipline\tComputer scientist\nSchool or tradition\tMoscow school of polynomial-time algorithms\nInstitutions\tMoscow State University\nTechnion\nBen-Gurion University\nNotable works\tDinic's algorithm\nFour Russians' Method\nWebsite\thttps://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~dinitz/\n\nYefim Dinitz (Russian: Ефим Абрамович Диниц,[2] Hebrew: יפים דיניץ) is a Soviet and Israeli computer scientist associated with the Moscow school of polynomial-time algorithms.[3] He invented Dinic's algorithm for computing maximal flow,[4] and he was one of the inventors of the Four Russians' algorithm for multiplying Boolean or mod 2 matrices.[5]: 243, 250 \n\nEducation and early work in the Adelson-Velsky group[edit]\n\nDinitz studied for a master's degree in Georgy Adelson-Velsky's group at Moscow State University.[4][6][3] In 1969, Adelson-Velsky started a seminar on algorithms, which his students and others close to him would later describe as \"the centre of scientific activity in polynomial-time algorithmics in Moscow\".[3] It was an exercise in \"Adel'son-Vel'sky's Algorithms class\", according to Dinitz, that led to the development of Dinic's algorithm in 1969.[4] Looking back, Dinitz and his classmates would write that the design of the algorithm reflected the atmosphere of Adelson-Velsky's group.[3] In Dinitz's words:[4]\n\nWe, Adel'son-Vel'sky's students, absorbed the whole paradigm of the Soviet computing school from his lectures. This paradigm consisted of eagerness to develop economical algorithms based on the deep investigation of a problem and on the use of smart data structure maintenance and amortized running time analysis as necessary components. … Hence, it was not surprising that my network flow algorithm, invented in January 1969, improved the Ford&Fulkerson algorithm by using and maintaining a layered network data structure and employing a delicate amortized analysis of the running time.\n\nDinitz published the algorithm in 1970.[7][8]\n\nIn early 1969, Dinitz was also working on the assignment problem with his classmate Mikhail Kronrod, contributing to the body of work in which \"the search for faster assignment algorithms began in earnest\".[9][4][10] The algorithm Dinitz and Kronrod published later that year could solve the assignment problem for n-vertex graphs in O(n3) steps.[9][11][12]\n\nDuring their time in Adelson-Velsky's algorithms seminar, Dinitz and Kronrod crossed paths with Vladimir Arlazarov and Igor Faradjev—two young mathematicians working in the Mathematical Laboratory at ITEP.[13][14][6] The lab was directed, until a political incident in 1968–1969, by Adelson-Velsky's academic sibling and longtime collaborator Aleksandr Kronrod.[6][15] In 1970, Dinitz, Mikhail Kronrod, Arlazarov, and Faradjev published the Boolean matrix multiplication algorithm that would make them famous as the \"Four Russians\".[16][17][18]\n\nWork in Moscow after the Adelson-Velsky group[edit]\n\nAdelson-Velsky had also signed the 1968 letter that led to Aleksandr Kronrod's 1969 dismissal from ITEP. In 1970, the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics graduated Adelson-Velsky's whole student group, and Adelson-Velsky was banned from teaching at Moscow State University.[6] However, Dinitz kept working on flow algorithms. He wrote a Moscow State University Ph.D. thesis on commodity flow problems, which he submitted in 1972.[19][20] He developed the idea of capacity scaling independently of Edmonds and Karp, who had just introduced it in the West, and he used it to invent one of the first polynomial-time algorithms for the minimum-cost flow problem.[19][3][21]\n\nDinitz also stayed in touch with his classmate Aleksandr Karzanov, publishing a paper on the minimum-cost flow problem with him in 1974.[6][4][10][19][22] In 1975, Dinitz and Karzanov joined Adelson-Velsky in publishing a book on network flow algorithms, which \"describe[d] many major results … that were independently discovered later (and in some cases much later) in the West\".[19][23][10][4]\n\nPublicity in the West[edit]\n\nIn 1974, Shimon Even and his graduate student Alon Itai at the Technion got curious about Dinitz's maximal flow algorithm, as well as a network flow algorithm that Karzanov had published around the same time.[4] Dinitz's description of the algorithm was very compressed, due to journal page limits, but Even and Itai managed to decipher most of it, thanks in part to Karzanov's explicit explanation of a concept that was implicit in Dinitz's paper.[4] After filling the last gap with a new technique of their own, Even and Itai had a working version of Dinitz's algorithm, which Even publicized in talks at many Western universities.[4]\n\nDinitz's name was transliterated as \"E. A. Dinic\" in the English translation of his paper, so Even and Itai's version of his algorithm became known as Dinic's algorithm in the West, and his name was \"rendered incorrectly as [dinik] instead of [dinits]\" in that context.[4]\n\nLater work at the Technion and Ben-Gurion University[edit]\n\nIn the 1990s, Even finally got a chance to learn the original version of Dinitz's algorithm from Dinitz himself.[4] In 1992, Dinitz published a paper on the butterfly network with Even and two other Technion computer scientists, listing his affiliation as Ben-Gurion University. Dinitz would reportedly later recall that Even fought successfully for him to be hired as an associate professor at the Technion.[24] He listed his affiliation as the Technion on a paper published in 1994, and he advised a Technion Ph.D. student in 1997.[25][26] Dinitz joined the computer science department at Ben-Gurion University in 1998, and the department held a retirement celebration for him in 2019.[27]\n\nDue to his publications with Shlomo Moran and Shmuel Zaks in the late 1990s and the 2000s, Dinitz has an Erdős number of two.[28][29]\n\nExternal links[edit]\n\"Yefim Dinitz\".

Children are separated into four age groups: Level T (infant & toddler), Level I (ages 3-6), Level II (ages 6-9), Level III (9-12); each age group meets in a separate atrium, and is taught lessons in a scope and sequence tailored to their age group.[1]\n\nThe lessons, with corresponding hands-on materials, are of these types:[6]\n\nThe Life of Christ\nGeography, Infancy Narratives, Paschal Narratives\nThe Liturgy and the Liturgical Year\nThe Sacraments\nThe Parables of the Kingdom\nThe Moral Parables\nMaxims (teachings of Jesus)\nThe Good Shepherd Parable\nPrayer and Scripture\nKingdom of God and Creation\nTypology (Scripture Study for older students)\nDerivatives[edit]\n\nYoung Children & Worship, a collection of lessons with accompanying hands-on materials, was developed by Jerome Berryman, an Episcopal priest, and Sonja Stewart, a professor of Christian education at Western Theological Seminary.[10] Berryman had studied the Montessori method in Italy, and had been trained in the Catechesis of the Good Shepherd. Berryman further developed their ideas into Godly Play, a method with curriculum. This method served as an alternative which is suitable for Protestants. Godly Play, in turn, has sparked several derivatives.\n\nAlthough there are apparent similarities in methodology and praxis, there are also key methodological and theological differences between the Catechesis of the Good Shepherd and Godly Play.[11]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b \"The CGS Approach\".

{"date": "2023-12-27-22-38", "error": false, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium_arsenide_antimonide", "text_blocks": "Gallium arsenide antimonide, also known as gallium antimonide arsenide or GaAsSb (GaAs1-xSbx), is a ternary III-V semiconductor compound. x indicates the fractions of arsenic and antimony in the alloy according to the aforementioned formula; it can take on any value between 0 and 1. GaAsSb refers generally to any composition of the alloy. It is considered as an alloy between gallium arsenide (GaAs) and gallium antimonide (GaSb).\n\nPreparation[edit]\n\nGaAsSb films have been grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) and liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) on gallium arsenide, gallium antimonide and indium phosphide substrates. It is often incorporated into layered heterostructures with other III-V compounds.\n\nThermodynamic Stability[edit]\n\nGaAsSb has a miscibility gap at temperatures below 751°C.[1] This means that intermediate compositions of the alloy below this temperature are thermodynamically unstable and can spontaneously separate into two phases: one GaAs-rich and one GaSb-rich. This limits the compositions of GaAsSb that can be obtained by near-equilibrium growth techniques, such as LPE, to those outside of the miscibility gap.[2] However, compositions of GaAsSb within the miscibility gap can be obtained with non-equilibrium growth techniques, such as MBE and MOVPE. By carefully selecting the growth conditions (e.g., the ratios of precursor gases in MOVPE) and maintaining relatively low temperatures during and after growth, it is possible to obtain compositions of GaAsSb within the miscibility gap that are kinetically stable. For example, this makes it possible to grow GaAsSb with the composition GaAs0.51Sb0.49, which, while normally within the miscibility gap at typical growth temperatures, can exist as a kinetically stable alloy.[1] This composition of GaAsSb is latticed matched to InP and is sometimes used in heterostructures grown on that substrate.\n\nElectronic Properties[edit]\nDirect bandgap versus composition for GaAsSb.[1]\n\nThe bandgap and lattice constant of GaAsSb alloys are between those of pure GaAs (a = 0.565 nm, Eg = 1.42 eV) and GaSb (a = 0.610 nm, Eg = 0.73 eV).[3] Over all compositions, the band gap is direct, like in GaAs and GaSb. Furthermore, the bandgap displays a minimum in composition at approximately x = 0.8 at T = 300 K, reaching a minimum value of Eg = 0.67 eV, which is slightly below that of pure GaSb.[1]\n\nApplications[edit]\n\nGaAsSb has been extensively studied for use in heterojunction bipolar transistors.[4][5] It has also been lattice-matched with InGaAs on InP to create and study a two-dimensional electron gas.[6]\n\nA GaAsSb/GaAs-based heterostructure was used to make a near-infrared photodiode with peak responsivity centered at 1.3 µm.[7]\n\nGaAsSb can be incorporated into III-V–based multi-junction solar cells to reduce the tunneling distance and increase the tunneling current between adjacent cells.[8]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d Cherng, M.

Cmdr. Tsurukichi Sabe\nVice admiral Gunichi Mikawa\nVice admiral Shinzō Ōnishi\n\nThe Akikaze massacre, was a war crime committed by the Imperial Japanese Navy on March 18, 1943, during the Pacific War.\n\nThe massacre took place on board the Minekaze-class destroyer Akikaze, in the waters of the Bismarck Archipelago, approximately 60 civilians were killed. Most of the victims were Catholic and Protestant clergy and missionaries, mostly of German nationality, who served in the northeastern New Guinea and the Admiralty Islands, their servants and dependents were also murdered, including three infants. Bishop Josef Lörks, Apostolic Vicar of Central New Guinea was amongst the massacred.\n\nBackground[edit]\n\nBefore World War I, the northeastern part of New Guinea was part of the colonial possessions of the German Empire. Under the Treaty of Versailles, Australia assumed sovereignty over these areas; they constituted the mandate territory of Australian New Guinea. Nevertheless, many German missionaries remained on the island, who tried to convert the indigenous population to Christianity and at the same time spread hygiene and provide health care to the native people.[1][2] Wewak was the seat of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Central New Guinea. During World War II, the German priest, Bishop Josef Lörks, served as the Apostolic Vicar there.[3]\n\nIn January 1943, Wewak was occupied by Japanese troops. Shortly thereafter, the occupiers gathered all the Catholic missionaries and moved them to the area of ​​the Saint John mission, which was located on the nearby island of Kairiru. Even though the German missionaries were citizens of allied Nazi Germany, the civil occupational administration established by the Imperial Navy (minsei-bu) considered them neutral citizens. They were allowed to move freely around the island.[4][5]\n\nNine months earlier, the Japanese had established a small outpost at Lorengau on Manus Island. A group of Protestant missionaries and their helpers, numbering about 20 people, lived there. Like on Wewak, the Japanese initially considered the missionaries to be neutral and allowed them to move freely around the island. The local Japanese commandant, Petty Officer Harukichi Ichinose was very friendly to the missionaries, often inviting them for dinner and sake at his residence.[6][7]\n\nThe reasons why the Japanese finally decided to murder the missionaries are not entirely clear. In 1943, the Japanese navy was suffering heavy losses in the waters around New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Solomon Islands.[8] Most notably in early March 1943, the Japanese suffered a serious defeat in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea.[9] After the war, Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa testified that there was a widespread belief among 8th Fleet officers that white missionaries and natives friendly to them were behind these defeats and were allegedly informing the Allies about the movements of Japanese units using hidden radios.[8] According to historian Mark Felton, this narrative was prepared by Tokkeitai to justify atrocities.[7] Heavy losses for the Japanese Navy were a consequence of the breaking of Japanese codes by American signals intelligence.[9]\n\nSome authors speculate that the massacre was caused by Japanese suspicions, most likely justified, that some missionaries and natives they were friendly with were helping Allied pilots who, after being shot down, were hiding in Wewak.[5][10][11] Bruce Gamble points out that at least two of the Verbites serving in Wewak were US citizens, and the massacre occurred a few days after a Japanese patrol unsuccessfully searched Vokeo Island for hiding pilots.[5] Yuki Tanaka theorized that initially the Japanese intended to use the missionaries' good relations with the local population and their knowledge of the area for their military purposes, but when they were refused, they were perceived as a threat.[12]\n\nCourse of the massacre[edit]\nBishop Josef Lörks, one of the victims of the massacre on board Akikaze\n\nIn mid-March 1943, the Minekaze-class destroyer Akikaze arrived in Wewak, bringing supplies of food and medicine for the local garrison. It then departed for Kairiru Island.[12] On March 17, before noon, Akikaze picked up 42 people at Kairiru, including Bishop Lörks.[13][5] In addition to German clergy and nuns, this group included two monks - US citizens, at least one Papuan girl, several Chinese who worked as the missionaries' servants, and two Chinese infants (orphans or children of Wewak storekeeper Ning Hee), who were cared for by the nuns.[5][12] These civilians were being evacuated due to the construction of a seaplane base on Kairiru.[14]\n\nInitially, the missionaries, their charges and servants were treated very well. The destroyer's commander, 2nd Lt. Cmdr. Tsurukichi Sabe gave them a separate cabin near the stern. Passengers were provided with sufficient water and food, and the ship's doctor provided assistance to those suffering from seasickness.[12]\n\nThe same day, Akikaze went to Lorengau, where in the late afternoon a further 20 people embarked, including 6 missionaires from Liebenzell Evangelical Mission, three other nuns, three other priests, a European infant, a plantation owner named Carl Muster, plantation overseer Peter Mathies, two Chinese, and four Malays. As in the case of the group from Wewak, most of the passengers were of German nationality, although the group from Lorengau also included one Hungarian missionary. Commander Sabe initially intended to place them in the same cabin as the Wewak group, but at the request of Petty Officer Ichinose, who personally escorted the missionaries aboard, he agreed to provide them with a separate cabin near the bow.[6]\n\nOn March 18, around 11:00, Akikaze anchored in the roadstead of the port of Kavieng in New Ireland. Shortly thereafter, a rowboat arrived with a messenger who brought an order intended exclusively for the destroyer's commander. Having read it, Sabe ordered the Akikaze to weigh anchor and set course for Rabaul. He then called all officers to a meeting and reported that the 8th Fleet command had ordered him to \"dispose of\" all civilians on board. Witnesses recalled that the commander was visibly shocked by the content of the order, describing it as \"regrettable\", but nevertheless he immediately began to execute it. The order did not explain why these unarmed civilians were to be executed.[15][16] Passengers from the aft cabin were moved to the bow cabin, justified by the need to carry out alleged cleaning works. At the same time, the ship's carpenters built a makeshift scaffold at the stern, which was to be used as an execution site. To ensure that the victims would not be aware of the purpose of this structure until the very end, a white cloth was spread at the stern, thus creating a kind of curtain. Straw mats were placed around the scaffold to absorb blood and facilitate subsequent cleaning of the deck.[17]\n\nThe execution was meticulously planned. The victims were called one by one to the bridge, where, through an interpreter, they were asked for their name, age and nationality, trying to create the impression that the purpose was merely to verify their identity. Two sailors then escorted the victim to the aft blindfolded.[17] After reaching the scaffold, the victim was tied with ropes to both wrists and then pulled up, making them hang with their arms raised above their head in a pose resembling crucifixion.[18][19] When the victim reached the appropriate height, a four-person firing squad commanded by Sub-Lieutenant Takeo Terada, opened fire with a light machine gun and rifles. When the execution began, the destroyer accelerated to a high speed of 24 knots, the screams and sounds of gunshots were drowned out by noise of the engine and winds. At the same time, the force of the winds and bullets pushed the hanging bodies over the sea, which made their subsequent removal easier and prevented blood from dripping onto the deck.[17][20] When the victim was dead, the body was untied and thrown overboard.[16]\n\nThe execution of approximately 60 victims took nearly three hours. Men were murdered first, followed by women. Three babies were snatched from the nuns by Japanese sailors and thrown overboard. After the execution, the deck was washed and the wooden structure was dismantled.[17][21] Then, Japanese officers performed a short Shinto ceremony in honor of the civilians they murdered.[22] During the ceremony, Commander Sabe ordered his subordinates to take an oath to keep the execution absolutely secret.[21]\n\nOn the same day, around 10 p.m., Akikaze entered the port of Rabaul.[17] Sub-lieutenant Yajirō Kai, who was assigned to the Akikaze crew at Wewak as a translator, testified after the war that he and Commander Sabe went to the 8th Fleet headquarters, where they were received by Lieutenant Shigetoku Kami. The two filed an execution report, Kami then ordered them to keep the events secret. He also ordered Sabe to secretly get rid of all the items that remained after the executions.[23]\n\nAftermath[edit]\n\nThe massacre of the missionaries was followed by an attempt to eradicate Christianity from the occupied New Guinea. Shortly after the clergy were deported from Wewak, Japanese soldiers thoroughly destroyed nearly 90% of the plantations they ran, along with the churches and health centers located there. They also murdered many Papuan converts to Christianity, along with non-Christian Papuans.[24]\n\nAkikaze maneuvering while under air attack off Truk, 17 February 1944\n\nOn 3 November 1944, the submarine USS Pintado fired a spread of torpedoes at the aircraft carrier Jun'yō, but Akikaze intercepted them, sacrificing herself to save the carrier. Akikaze was sunk, taking her entire crew of around 154 men with her.[25] Commander Tsurukichi Sabe and firing squad commander Sub-lieutenant Takeo Terada died during the war. Sabe died on August 2, 1943, when Akikaze was attacked and damaged by American planes.[26]\n\nBishop Josef Lörks is beatified as a martyr of the Catholic church along with Bishop Franziskus Wolf, Apostolic Vicar of Eastern New Guinea who died in Japanese captivity.\n\nAkikaze is considered as one of the Japanese \"hell ships\".\n\nPost-war investigation[edit]\n\nAfter the war, Australian investigators tried to determine the fate of several dozen civilians of European origin who fell into the hands of the Japanese after the fall of New Ireland. Analyzing the movements of Japanese ships and warships that traveled between Kavieng and Rabaul during the war, they interrogated several sailors from the crew of the Akikaze. During interrogations in December 1946, they admitted that in March 1943 a group of Europeans had been murdered onboard the destroyer. Between January and April 1947, the Australians found and interrogated more sailors from Akikaze. Their testimonies allowed for a relatively accurate reconstruction of the course of the war crime.[1]\n\nLieutenant Shigetoku Kami of the 8th Fleet was the only staff officer whose name appeared in the testimony of Japanese witnesses. However, Australian investigators suspected that the order to murder over 60 civilians could not have been given by such a low-ranking officer. Therefore, the commander of the 8th Fleet at the time, Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa, was interrogated. Mikawa and his chief of staff Vice Admiral Shinzō Ōnishi both vehemently denied any responsibility for the massacre. They initially claimed that Akikaze had never been part of the 8th Fleet, however, that would have made it impossible for Kami to issue the orders even if he did so without permission. They later claimed it was Lieutenant Kami - perhaps in collaboration with another staff officer who was in charge of civilian affairs - Commander Norisaka Andō - who independently ordered the execution of the missionaries and informed about it only after the fact. The motive supposedly because of suspicions that the missionaries were informing the Allies about the movements of Japanese ships.[8] Mikawa claimed that he was shocked when he learned of the massacre from Kami, but was unable to investigate further as he was ordered back to Tokyo for a new assignment.[27]\n\nDue to navy procedures in force during the war, it was unlikely that communication officers of the 8th Fleet would agree to encrypt and deliver Kami's order to the commander of Akikaze, if it did not bear the countersignatures of Mikawa and Ōnishi. Kami, Andō, the head of communications of the 8th Fleet, Commander Torao Mori and staff cipher officer Sub-Lieutenant Maeda Minoru could not confirm nor deny the admirals' version of events, because they had all died during the war.[27] In the opinion of Captain Albert Klestadt, an Australian member of the investigation, even if their claims were true, they had to accept command responsibility for being unable to prevent war crimes committed by subordinates[27]\n\nUltimately, the Australians did not bring any charges in the Akikaze massacre. This was probably due to the fact that the main suspects died during the war and there were no Australians among the victims.[28] In addition, most of the civilians killed were Germans, and were technically not \"victims of war crimes\" as defined in the Australian War Crimes Act of 1945. Due to the fact that the murdered included US citizens, the Australians handed over the investigation to the American authorities in July 1947. However, the Americans did not take any further action.[29] Neither Admiral Mikawa nor Admiral Ōnishi were prosecuted for the Akikaze massacre, they both lived to be over 90, dying in the 1980s.\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b Tanaka 1998, p. 171.\n^ Felton 2007, p. 103–104.\n^ Felton 2007, p. 103.\n^ Tanaka 1998, p. 171, 173.\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d e Gamble 2013, p. 48.\n^ \nJump up to:\na b Tanaka 1998, p. 173–174.\n^ \nJump up to:\na b Felton 2007, p. 105.\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c Tanaka 1998, p. 179–180.\n^ \nJump up to:\na b Michno 2016, p. 101.\n^ Lamont-Brown 2002, p. 73.\n^ Michno 2016, p. 101, 125.\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d Tanaka 1998, p. 173.\n^ Sissons 2020, p. 123.\n^ Townsend, G.W.L.

Vijay and Ajay are twins, but Vijay has trouble moving around. Shekhar drives a jeep, and Annie teaches violin. Despite some money problems, they're a happy family, except when Shekhar spends too much money at the local \"toddy shop\" because he sometimes drinks too much.\n\nA local toddy vendor Patangrao Kurhade (Nagesh Bhonsle) had an eye on Nandini. One day, he went to her house and tried to rape her. Shekhar came to know about that and has a fight with Patangrao, and things take a bad turn. Patangrao decides to get back at Shekhar. When he sees Ajay riding his bicycle, he hits him with his van. Ajay is hurt, and they find out he needs a blood transfusion. But there's a problem - Nandini can't donate her blood because she's sick. The doctors tell them Nandini has late-stage leukemia and only has a few months to live. This is a shock for the family.\n\nShekhar tries to change his ways, but one day, during a fight with Patangrao, he gets killed. Nandini is devastated, but she decides to be strong for her family. She worries about what will happen to her kids after she's gone. She doesn't want them to end up in an orphanage like she and Shekhar did, labeled as orphans. So, she makes a tough decision - she will give her children up for adoption.\n\nNandini, with the help of the school principal, Bapusaheb (Bal Dhuri), arranges for her kids to be adopted. Sonu goes to a doctor's family, Dr. Karnik (Tushar Dalvi) & Mrs. Karnik (Resham Tipnis). Nandini hopes that Ajay and Vijay can stay together, but it's hard to find a family willing to take care of a disabled child like Vijay. Eventually, Nandini decides to give Ajay to a rich couple that is Mr. Pendse (Laxmikant Berde) and Mrs. Pendse (Priya Berde).\n\nAnju, the teenage daughter, decides to stay with her mom, but Nandini and Bapusaheb convince her it's for the best. She goes to live with an old rich couple, Mr. Chaudhari (Ramesh Deo) and Mrs. Chaudhari (Jayshree Gadkar). Now, only Vijay is left without a family. Nandini and Bapusaheb struggle to find someone to take care of him.\n\nAs Nandini's health gets worse, she plans a special Diwali celebration at home. She writes a letter to Anju, asking her to always keep in touch with her brothers. On Diwali morning, Nandini dreams that all her children have come to see her, but it's just a dream. She prays for one more day to live so she can see her kids for the last time. In a heartbreaking moment, Vijay finds Nandini dead that night.\n\nAt Nandini's funeral, all her children and their new families are there. After the burial, the children and their families sadly part ways. Vijay is about to go to an orphanage when something unexpected happens - Ajay's adoptive parents return. Vijay runs to Ajay, and they embrace each other. Ajay's adoptive father, moved by their connection, agrees to take in Vijay as well. The movie ends with the two brothers happily together.\n\nCast[edit]\nPadmini Kolhapure as Nandini; a school teacher\nSachin Khedekar as Shekhar; a truck driver\nNagesh Bhonsle as Patangrao Kurhade; a local toddy vendor & main antagonist\nBal Dhuri as Bapusaheb; a principal of school\nMeghana Chate as Anju; elder daughter of Nandini & Shekhar\nNihar Shembekar as Vijay; elder son of Nandini & Shekhar\nAvinash Chate as Ajay; younger son of Nandini & Shekhar\nBharti Chate as Soni; younger daughter of Nandini & Shekhar\nVijay Chavan as Dattu; Patangrao's employee\nRajshekhar as Abasaheb; the chairman of school\nLaxmikant Berde as Shriyut Pendse; Ajay & Vijay's adopted father\nPriya Berde as Priya Pendse; Ajay & Vijay's adopted mother\nRamesh Deo[6] as Ramesh Chaudhari; Adopted father of Anju\nJayshree Gadkar as Maithili Chaudhari; Adopted mother of Anju\nTushar Dalvi as Mr. Karnik; Adopted father of Soni\nResham Tipnis as Mrs. Karnik; Adopted mother of Soni\nAnand Abhyankar as Doctor\nMahesh Kokate as PT instructor Dongre\nAmbar Kothare as Shekhar's boss\nSoundtrack[edit]\n\nMusic for this film is composed by Achyut Thakur Lyrics were written by Jagdish Khebudkar.[7][8]\n\nNo.\tTitle\tSinger(s)\tLength\n1.\t\"Kiranancha Bandhuni Maal\"\tAnuradha Paudwal, Achyut Thakur\t04:39\n2.\t\"Majhya Gharacha Gokul Jhala\"\tSuresh Wadkar, Anuradha Paudwal\t05:40\n3.\t\"Kashi Kalachi Chalu Aali\"\tSuresh Wadkar\t04:27\n4.\t\"Kon Dakhavila Vat\"\tSuresh Wadkar\t06:23\n5.\t\"Maya Mandir Halale\"\tRavindra Sathe\t05:30\n6.\t\"Sare Gama Padhanisa\"\tAnuradha Paudwal\t04:58\nReferences[edit]\n^ KOTHARE, MAHESH (1 January 2023).

{"date": "2023-12-27-22-38", "error": false, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gian_Maillu", "text_blocks": "David Gian Maillu (born 19 October 1939) is a Kenyan author and publisher. He is considered East Africa's most prolific writer, having published over 60 books between 1972 and 2021.\n\nMost of his work is in English and Kiswahili, and he also published the first book of poetry in Kikamba.\n\nLife[edit]\n\nAt first I didn't even know whether an African could write...I had nobody to tell me how to write. I just kept on writing, first traditional stories, and then fiction, even science fiction, and then poetry and anything else. At a later stage I developed an interest in philosophy and practical psychology; in fact, human relations are what I mainly write about now.\n\nDavid Maillu, 1976[1]\n\nDavid G. Maillu was born in Kilungu Location in what was then Kenya Colony. He was the first child of Joseph Mulandi and Esther Kavuli. His parents were poor and illiterate, and their son's exact birthdate was uncertain.[2][3]\n\nMaillu taught himself to read and write before joining Machakos Technical School in 1951. Four years later, he earned the Cambridge School Certificate, having studied privately through the British Tutorial College.[2]\n\nMaillu then considered enrolling at the University College of Nairobi to study literature, but changed his mind when he discovered the syllabus featured only Western writers. His interest lay with Kenyan writers, including Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o.[2]\n\nIn 1964, he joined the Voice of Kenya radio station as a graphic designer. He soon became dissatisfied, but remained in the role until the early 1974 due to financial constraints.[4][5]\n\nIn 1971, he married Hannelore Kuthmann, a German woman who moved to Kenya in 1967 to work for the Kenya Council of Churches. In 1974 their daughter, Elizabeth Kavuli, was born. Elizabeth was Maillu's second child. His first daughter, Christine Mwende, was born seven years earlier.[3][4]\n\nWork[edit]\n\nWhen David Maillu could not get any of the established publishers to accept his manuscripts, he set up Comb Books to publish his own work, with typesetting machinery paid for by Danish aid. He also started the cult of the tiny book for the handbag. One of his runaway sellers was After 4.30 which revealed the sexy experiences of secretaries after the office doors closed at the end of the working day; it was bound in a tiny format so that the secretary could discreetly slip the book into her handbag along with her comb when the boss came in.\n\nJames Currey[6]\n\nDavid Maillu's earliest writing appeared in a magazine called Risk, based in Geneva, and in the East African Publishing House's Ghala magazine. [3][7] He went on to publish over 60 books between 1972 and 2021. Many of these were self-published, first by his Comb Books imprint, then by David Maillu Publishing. By the 1980s his work was published by Macmillian.[3]\n\nDespite the scope of his work, Maillu has not been taken seriously by academics. Many of his early works were considered sexually explicit, and some were banned in Tanzania in June 1976.[8][9]\n\nComb Books[edit]\n\nMaillu established Comb Books in 1972, publishing dozens of books over the next five years. These were mostly written by Maillu himself.\n\nThe first release from Comb Books was also the first book of poetry ever published in Kikamba. Appearing under the title Kĩ Kyambonie: Kĩkamba nthimo, the book sold poorly due to the limited market, and Maillu quickly turned his attention to writing in English.[10]\n\nIt was Maillu's 1973 thrillers, Unfit for Human Consumption and My Dear Bottle, that brought him his first success as a writier and publisher. These two publications also demonstrated Maillu's versatility, with the first written in prose and the second as a long narrative poem.[3] My Dear Bottle proved controversial, with Maillu presenting AIDS as a new scourge of Africa.[11] These early titles appeared as 'Comb Mini Novels'; small format novellas measuring 3.5 x 5 inches and sold for five East African Shillings.[12]\n\nIn 1974 Maillu wrote and published After 4.30, which would again prove controversial. After 4.30 is long poem narrating the troubled life of a single mother, Emili Katongo, who is forced into prostitution.[3][13] Schatzberg considers Maillu: 'remarkably ahead of his time in his acute perception of gender consciousness'.[14]\n\nIn 1975 and 1976 Maillu published his epic verse narrative The Kommon Man over three volumes. The Kommon Man is narrated by an average Kenyan struggling to survive in the difficult economic climate of the day. A series of injustices occur, illustrating the corruption and inequalities faced by many in the country.[3][9] Maillu's status as one of Kenya's most popular authors was clear by this stage, with the first print run of The Kommon Man running to 10,000 copies. It included a 20-item questionnaire to capture his readership's interests.[5]\n\n1976 also saw Maillu release two epistolary novels, Dear Monika and Dear Daughter, which again proved popular.[3] By this stage, Comb Books employed seven or eight full time staff and had purchased computerised typesetting equipment. The possibility of establishing offices in Europe and West Africa was considered.[5][15] But a Tanzanian ban on his work that year, combined with political instability elsewhere in the region, marked the beginning of the end for Comb Books. No books were published in 1977, and in 1978 only two titles appeared. These were released under Maillu's pseudonym Vigad G. Mulila. The firm declared bankruptcy later that year.[5][15]\n\nDavid Maillu Publishers[edit]\n\nLiterary critics have not been very generous in their assessments of Maillu's work. No one has lavished praise on him, and few have admitted finding any redeeming value in what or how he writes. The general feeling among serious academics appears to be that such literature is beneath criticism for it is wholly frivolous, the assumption being that a scholar should not waste his time on art that aims to be truly popular. Yet Maillu cannot be ignored in any systematic effort to understand the evolution of an East African literature, for he has extended the frontiers of that literature farther than any other single writer.\n\nBernth Lindfors, 1982[16]\n\nMaillu quickly establishing a new publishing company, this time under his own name. David Maillu Publishers first book, Kadosa, was released in 1979. Maillu considered this his favourite work, and it presents a blend of romance, adventure, science fiction, metaphysical speculation, and hallucinogenic horror. Lindfors considered Kadosa as 'remarkable' and 'utterly unlike anything he had written before'.[17]\n\nMacmillian and other publishers[edit]\n\nDavid Maillu went on to publish for Macmillian and others from the early 1980s.\n\nTitles included the popular Benni Kamba 009 books as well as 1991s Broken Drum, which is the story of a European traveller who believes Africans have AIDS simply because they are African.[11]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nMaillu, David G.

It is led by engineer Vaclovas Žutautas. The party has not achieved significant success in Lithuanian elections.\n\nHistory[edit]\nLithuanian Pensioners' Party[edit]\n\nThe party was founded as the Lithuanian Pensioners' Party (Lithuanian: Lietuvos pensininkų partija) on 14 June 2007. It described itself as a pensioners' party and its foundation was motivated by injustice towards retired persons in Lithuania.[3] The party's founder, Vytautas Jurgis Kadžys, was a retired army officer who formerly belonged to the far-right Lithuanian Nationalist Union and National Democratic Party of Lithuania.[4] However, Kadžys claimed that the party belongs to neither the political left nor the right and will cooperate with parties from the entire political spectrum.[3]\n\nIt protested Lithuania's accession to the Eurozone and demanded pensions to be indexed with inflation.[5]\n\nIt participated in the 2011 municipal elections and received 0.37% of the vote, but did not win any mandates.[6] It finished with a worse result in the municipal elections of 2015 and ceased participating in municipal elections.[7]\n\nIn 2016, it joined Naglis Puteikis, 2014 presidential election candidate and former Homeland Union member of the Seimas, and journalist Kristupas Krivickas in the \"Anti-Corruption Coalition\". A wide coalition of anti-establishment parties, it was also joined by the Lithuanian Centre Party, the Political Party \"Centre of Trade Unions\", the Lithuanian Party of Christian Democracy, and former National Resurrection Party member Ligitas Kernagis.[8] Though the coalition received 6.32% of the vote, it did not reach the 7% threshold required for multi-party coalitions and did not win proportional seats.[9]\n\nUnion of Intergenerational Solidarity[edit]\n\nIn January 2020, the party was joined by philosopher Arvydas Juozaitis, who was elected the new party chairman.[10] Juozaitis was a candidate in the 2019 presidential election and campaigned against globalisation and European integration, and had intended to found his own party, but failed to gather the required number of founding members.[10] The party was renamed to the Union of Intergenerational Solidarity - Cohesion for Lithuania (Lithuanian: Kartų solidarumo sąjunga - Santalka Lietuvai), and it was joined by former Order and Justice MP Juozas Imbrasas, giving it its first and only member in the Seimas.[11] The new chairman reasserted the party's defense of pensioner interests, while at the same time requesting youth members, claiming that the party's members require help with modern technology.[11]\n\nTwo other right-wing parties founded in the leadup to the 2020 parliamentary election, the National Alliance and Christian Union, originally considered unifying with Juozaitis' movement, but split and the three parties denounced one another.[12]\n\nJuozaitis described it as a \"people's party\" and claimed that it seeks to replicate the grassroots success of Barack Obama in Lithuania.[12] It received 0.51% of the vote in the election and did not win a single mandate.[13]\n\nJuozaitis resigned as party chairman after the election, on 30 November 2020.[14]\n\nTogether with the Vytis[edit]\n\nThe party was renamed again, to its current name, in June 2021, and Vaclovas Žutautas was elected as its new chairman.[15]\n\nIt endorsed Valdas Tutkus in the 2024 presidential election.[16]\n\nPositions[edit]\n\n\"Together with the Vytis\" supports pensioners' interests, such as indexing of pensions and reform to the retirement fund system.[17] It defines itself as a nationalist party which seeks to defend Lithuanian national values[15] and family values.[12]\n\nIt presents itself as an anti-establishment party opposed to a \"moral neo-Marxist revolution from the West\" and supports geopolitical neutrality.[18] The party also supports nationalization of strategic sectors of the economy, abandoning the Euro and restoring the Lithuanian litas.[19]\n\nElection results[edit]\nSeimas[edit]\nElection\tVotes[a]\t%\tSeats\t+/–\tGovernment\n2016[b]\t77,144\t6.32 (#5)\t\n0 / 141\n\t\tOpposition\n2020\t5,808\t0.51 (#16)\t\n0 / 141\n\t 0\tOpposition\n^ Proportional representation votes.\n^ As a member of the \"Anti-Corruption Coalition of Kristupas Krivickas and Naglis Puteikis\".\nMunicipal[edit]\nElection\tVotes[a]\t%\tCouncil seats\tMayors\t+/–\n2011\t4,136\t0.37 (#17)\t\n0 / 1,466\n\t\n0 / 60\n\t\n2015\t943\t0.08 (#20)\t\n0 / 1,473\n\t\n0 / 60\n\t 0\n2019\tDid not compete\tDid not compete\t\n0 / 1,442\n\t\n0 / 60\n\t 0\n2023\tDid not compete\tDid not compete\t\n0 / 1,498\n\t\n0 / 60\n\t 0\n^ Municipal council election votes.\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"Kartu su Vyčiu, politinė partija\".

The Skykomish were a Lushootseed speaking Coast Salish people.\n\nThe Skykomish people have been variously categorized as a subgroup of the Snoqualmie people, or as a tribe in their own right.[1][2]\n\nGeography[edit]\nThis detail from an 1857 map shows the territory of the Skykomish people (here labeled Skywamish).\n\nThe territory of the Skykomish consisted of the Skykomish river drainage, from about modern-day Sultan to Index.[1]\n\nTwo bands made up the Skykomish. From Sultan to Index were the Sq́exwəbc. From Index into the mountains were the bəsx̌əx̌əx̌alč, meaning fern people.[3]\n\nThe Skykomish also had summer dwellings on Puget Sound and its islands, for temporary use.[3]\n\nTribespeople used canoes to travel via waterways; shovel-nosed canoes for upriver travel, and deep-water canoes for downriver and ocean travel.[4]\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nThe Skykomish engaged in trade with Europeans at Fort Nisqually[2]\n\nIn 1849, the Skykomish and Snoqualmie attacked Fort Nisqually. However, during the 1855-56 Puget Sound War, the Skykomish followed the lead of Pro-American Snoqualmie Chief Patkanin and remained neutral.[2]\n\nThe Skykomish were represented in the Treaty of Point Elliot by seven signatories: Smeh-mai-hu, Lugs-ken, We-ai-pah, Peh-nus, Twooi-as-kut, Heh-mahl, and Steh-shail (William).[5] This treaty was the impetus for the Tulalip Reservation, to which the Skykomish people relocated.[6]\n\nIn the mid-1800s, the population of the Skykomish was estimated at 300–450. By 1900, there were about 320 Skykomish left, living in Sultan and Gold Bar.[7]\n\nAt a 1933 re-enactment of the signing of the Treaty at Juanita Bay, the Skykomish were represented by Chief Black Thunder, also known as Mr. Bagley.[8][9]\n\nQuestion of Tribal Independence[edit]\n\nScholars have long been divided on whether the Skykomish people are best described as a tribe, or a subgroup within the Snoqualmie Tribe.[2] The Treaty of Point Elliot indicates that the Skykomish were a tribe. However, the historically close relationships between the Skykomish, Snohomish, and Snoqualmie peoples makes it difficult to define distinct territorial and cultural boundaries.[1]\n\nIn 1960, the Indian Claims Commission ruled that the Skykomish people were a separate identifiable people from the Snoqualmies.[2] However, on appeal, Judge Don Nelson Laramore ruled that in light of the fact that a number of members of the Snoqualmie Tribe considered themselves both Skykomishes and Snoqualmies, the Snoqualmie Tribe does have a right to represent the Skykomish people.[10]\n\nThe specific language of the Skykomish, a potential tool in evaluating cultural overlap with other tribes, is an object of debate. Anthropologist Colin Tweddell believes the Skykomish spoke a Skagit dialect of Lushootseed, along with the Snohomish. The Indian Claims Commission found that the Skykomish spoke Southern Lushootseed, as do the Snoqualmies. In 1852, Indian Agent E.A. Starling the Skykomish (or Skea-wa-mish/Skea-nu-mish) speak the Snohomish language, which is distinct both from the Nesqually language (used by the Snoqualmie) and the Ska-git language.[3][11]\n\nSubsistence[edit]\n\nThe Skykomish relied on a diet similar to other tribes on the western slopes of the Cascades. This consisted of plant life (sand rush, salmonberries, strawberries, blackberries, blackcaps, salalberries, huckleberries, blueberries, blue elderberries, hazelnuts) and animal (deer, elk, mountain goat, salmon, clams, and cockles). Deer hides and goat wool were used as trade supplies.[12]\n\nMountain berries were gathered and sold fresh to settlers at lower elevation, or made into dried cakes for storage.[13]\n\nBeargrass was collected to make baskets.[13]\n\nCulture[edit]\n\nPotlatch houses were social, commercial, and ceremonial centers.[3]\n\nSalmon fishing was done with weirs. Skykomish families would take trips to Puget Sound during the Spring and Summer months to gather seafood.[4]\n\nCaps were made from mountain goat heads, with the horns and ears still attached.[13]\n\nThe Skykomish engaged in commerce and communication with many surrounding tribes, including with the Snohomish, Snoqualmie, Stillaguamish, and Wenatchi peoples.[6]\n\nLegacy[edit]\n\nThe Skykomish River, and the City of Skykomish, are both named for the tribe.[2][14]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c Hollenbeck, Jan L.; Moss, Madonna (1987).

It served as the primary book of the Beauvais Cathedral in present Beauvais, Oise, France for well over 490 years, up until dispersal from the French Revolution. Passing from collector to collector, it made it to the manuscript collection of William Randolph Hearst, who eventually sold it to book dealer Philip C. Duschnes in 1942, where subsequently him and his friend Otto Ege, separated the book into several singular folios.[1][2][3]\n\nConsidered a textbook tragedy of the destruction of a medieval manuscript for the sake of collecting in the 19th-20th centuries, where one folio can sell for a higher profit margin than a whole book, the manuscript has dispersed into many museums and private collections. There has been an effort underway to reconstruct the manuscript digitally, and over the courses of years, the discovery of pages has come into public spotlight.[1][2][4][5]\n\nComposition[edit]\n\nThe Missal, which was a composition of 309 leaves composes of a calendrical guide containing the prayers, chants, and guides for the Mass for the Catholic Church.[6]\n\nIn the 13th century, the Missal was standardized into one book, called the Missal Plenum (Latin: \"Full Missal\").[6]\n\nThe Beauvais Missal was written approximate at the turn of the 14th century, under the ownership of Robert de Hangest, a canon to the Beauvais Cathedral. It is speculated that the artist of the manuscript may have been the same artist who composed the Book of Hours of Yolande of Soissons (Morgan Library MS.M.729), as through documents, Hangest lived 10 miles northwest of Amiens, where the alleged artist lived.[7]\n\nThe Missal has been attribute to a workshop called the \"Cholet Group\", based on the similarities of the initials, figures and marginalia to that of the Bibliotheque de l’Arsenal MS 25.[3]\n\nOn September 1356, sensing his death, Hangest donated the Missal to the cathedral as listed in the registers of Beauvais in exchange for an annual remembrance mass for him on his passing. He died 3 November 1356.[2][7][8][9]\n\nProvenance and Separation[edit]\n\nThe Missal was in the cathedral's inventory for centuries, documented in four centuries later in the 17th century, but during the Dechristianization of France during the French Revolution, the library of Beauvais was dispersed. [2][7]\n\nIn 1843, a commercial broker of Lyon, Henri Auguste Brölemann, gilt and bound the manuscript, wherein it was passed through descent to great-granddaughter Madame Etienne Mallet. [2][7]\n\nOn 4 May 1926, it was sold at Sotheby's to an antique bookdealer William Permain for £970 who represented media mogul William Randolph Hearst, who brought it from London to the United States. He subsequently sold the manuscript in 1942 to Philip Duschnes.[1][2]\n\nDuschnes, and his friend, Otto Ege, a teacher at Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland Institute of Art dismantled the book, selling folios for $25-40 to increase the profit margins of the book. As such the manuscript has been separated into fragments since then.[2]\n\nDigital Reconstruction[edit]\n\nThere has been recent efforts reconstruct the manuscript through digital means, in the years since the death of Ege, as the folio has been dispersed in many collections all over the world. The effort under is helmed by Lisa Fagin Davis, professor of manuscript studies at Simmons University as well as director of the Medieval Academy of America.[1][4][5]\n\nAs of December 2023, 122 pages of the 309 have been identified and reconstructed, all of which are identified from the same volume as they compose of the rites of summer feasts, as well as Easter and Advent.[1]\n\nManuscript folios continue to show up on the market to this day.\n\nIn 2022, a folio emerged at an estate sale in Waterville, Maine, purchased for $75. The page was then authenticated by Davis and the faculty of Colby College.[2][5][4][10]\n\nSubsequently on October 2022, a folio featuring entries for the feast of St. Callixtus and St. Lucian was authenticated by Davis upon acquisition to the University of Connecticut's Archives & Special Collection by School of Nursing Faculty Prof. Thomas Long, who acquired the piece in the late 1990s.\n\nCurrently, the bulk of the manuscript is held in New England by UMass, UConn, Rhode Island School of Design, Harvard, Yale, Smith, Wellesley, Dartmouth, and Colby College, in addition to the Wadsworth Atheneum and Boston Public Library.[1][11]\n\nAdditional fragments are currently held worldwide, including Oslo Cathedral, Waseda University, and France.[12][13][14]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d e f Phillips, Kimberly (2023-12-18). \"Page From Storied Beauvais Missal Added to UConn's Archives; Donation Courtesy of Professor Emeritus\".

He is the president of BC Dnipro, the head of the Basketball Federation of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, and a former vice-president of Basketball Federation of Ukraine.[5] According to Ukrainian media, he is part of the Narik group, headed by mafia boss Oleksandr Petrovskyi,[1][4] and he is an associate of oligarch Ihor Kolomoyskyi.[6][7]\n\nEarly life[edit]\n\nValerii Kondratiev was born on 28 August 1970 in Dnipro.\n\nThe era of Gorbachev's \"Perestroika\" — the late 80s — became for Kondratiev a kind of start in career. And at the same time he came to the attention of the police. In the late 80s, the police of the central Dnipro market \"Ozerka\" recorded a group of young sportsmen who were cheating with the help of the then popular game \"Thimbles\". The head of the group was Oleksandr Petrovskyi, nicknamed Narik.[4]\n\nThe group of thimbles, in addition to Valerii Kondratiev nicknamed Gastello, according to police reports, included young judokas and boxers — Dato Suladze (nicknamed Dato), Sasha Yevtushenko, Oleh Panasenko, Roma Shovkoplyas (Roma Lugansky), Bohdan Gulyamov (Bodia), Valera Gulyaev (Slon), Serhiy Oliynyk (Umka), Sasha Lisovenko, Sasha Kavdax (Shtrek) and Albert Koleskor (Durnenky).[4]\n\nMany of the former young \"fighters\", including Valerii Kondratiev, became businessmen, philanthropists, and partners of Oleksandr Petrovskyi in commercial activities decades later.[8]\n\nValerii Kondratiev is the president of the BC Dnipro, the head of the Basketball Federation of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, and was also the vice president of the Basketball Federation of Ukraine.[5]\n\nIn 2019, he was named one of the top 30 most influential people in Dnipro by The New Voice of Ukraine.[9]\n\nInvestigations[edit]\nRelations with Kolomoyskyi[edit]\n\nThe Ukrainian sports media Tribuna calls Valerii Kondratiev a long-time business partner of oligarch Ihor Kolomoyskyi.[7] The investigation states that the BC Dnipro has several legal entities — BSC Dnipro and BC Dnipro — whose ultimate beneficiary is Kolomoyskyi. The trail of the oligarch is also specifically indicated by the fact that, along with Kondratiev, the beneficiary of BSC Dnipro is a Cypriot Andreas Sofoleous, who is listed in BC Budivelnyk's beneficiary company, BUDIVELNYK PROPERTIES INC.[7]\n\nSuspicion of money laundering[edit]\n\nAccording to an investigation by Dnipro journalists, Kondratiev is the formal president of BC Dnipro, as he uses this position to launder money.[1] According to the journalists, under the leadership of Valerii Kondratiev, in 2022, BC Dnipro suffered a loss of UAH 60.4 thousand in financial results.[1]\n\nControversies[edit]\nDeath threats to referees[edit]\n\nIn December 2019, Valeriy Kondratiev, together with Ihor Kolomoyskyi, threatened and intimidated a referee of a Ukrainian Basketball SuperLeague match. The incident occurred during a match between BC Dnipro and BC Kyiv-Basket.[10]\n\nAfter the regular season match of the Ukrainian Basketball SuperLeague between BC Dnipro and BC Kyiv-Basket (75:78), Valerii Kondratiev, as well as Ihor Kolomoyskyi and Valerii Guliaev, threatened the team of referees, in particular the chief referee of the match, Andriy Babyk, according to his report published by the Basketball Federation of Ukraine, on the way to the referee's room, he was approached by three people with threats.[11]\n\nAs a result, the Basketball Federation of Ukraine decided to suspend the president of the Dnipro club for two games and to fine him: BC Dnipro for 32 thousand hryvnias, and Kondratiev for 20 thousand hryvnias.\n\nOffences[edit]\n\nIn December 2021, the Basketball Federation of Ukraine fined Valerii Kondratiev for violating a number of issues related to the conduct and organisation of the Ukrainian Basketball SuperLeague.[12]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ a b c d Petro Shchukin (2023-11-28). \"Гастело: останній політ.

Played at the end of the finals series, the game has been held annually since 2006.\n\nThe club which wins the grand final receives the A-League Men championship trophy, and the best player receives the Joe Marston Medal.\n\nAs of 2023, a total of 18 grand finals have been played, four of which have ended in penalty shoot-outs. Sydney FC have won five grand finals, the most of any club; Melbourne Victory have the second-most with four, and Brisbane Roar third-most with three. Sydney FC have also appeared in the most grand finals, a total of seven; and the only club along with Brisbane Roar to win back-to-back Grand Finals. Every current A-League Men club has played in at least one grand final, with the exception of Macarthur FC and Wellington Phoenix.\n\nMatch history[edit]\nEarly years (2005–2010)[edit]\nMelbourne Victory celebrating their 2007 A-League Grand Final victory.\n\nThe A-League Men was established for the 2005–06 season by eight clubs, after the National Soccer League folded in 2004. The national league finals system was then reverted to the page playoff system, so only top four teams can qualify. The first grand final in 2006 took place at Sydney Football Stadium between Sydney FC and Central Coast Mariners as Sydney FC won the home ground advantage by defeating premiers Adelaide United to host. Sydney won 1–0 to become the first champions of the A-League Men.[1] The first Joe Marston Medalist was Dwight Yorke, captain of Sydney FC at the time. In 2007, The Original Rivalry teams of premiers Melbourne Victory defeated Adelaide United 6–0; the largest margin of an A-League Men grand final. At Telstra Dome (now Marvel Stadium), it set the largest sporting attendance at the venue of 55,436. Archie Thompson scored five in the match; the only player to score five goals in an A-League Men grand final, earning him the Joe Marston Medal.\n\nThe grand final in 2008 between the Central Coast Mariners and Newcastle Jets, despite Central Coast as the host winner and Bluetongue Stadium (now Industree Group Stadiums) being deemed by FFA insufficient capacity to host the grand final, Sydney Football Stadium instead hosted the grand final for the second time, which was won 1–0 by Newcastle. The Original Rivalry teams returned to the grand final in 2009, with Victory claiming their second championship; winning 1–0 against Adelaide becoming the first A-Leagues club to win the domestic treble. Melbourne Victory and Sydney FC, teams of The Big Blue were the grand finalists of 2010; the fourth consecutive rivalry grand final since 2007. Sydney won 4–2 after the first penalty shoot-out in the A-League Men grand final after a 1–1 draw at Etihad Stadium's third and final A-League Men grand final.[2]\n\n2011–2019[edit]\nBrisbane Roar fans during the 2012 A-League Grand Final trophy ceremony.\n\nWith Brisbane Roar claiming the premiership and hosting the grand final in 2011 against Central Coast Mariners, it became the first grand final since its establishment outside of Melbourne and Sydney, to be hosted at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane. Brisbane won 4–2 on penalties, after a 2–2 draw by two late Brisbane goals in the final four minutes of extra time. Mathew Ryan with the Central Coast Mariners won the Joe Marston Medal as the first to win it on the losing team of the A-League Men grand final. It returned to Suncorp Stadium the following year in 2012, with Brisbane against the Perth Glory; 2–1 via a late comeback winner, becoming the first A-League Men club to win back-to-back grand finals.\n\nThe Western Sydney Wanderers in their first ever season reached the 2013 grand final against the Central Coast Mariners. The host venue was again chosen as Sydney Football Stadium for the third time, due to Wanderers' home ground Parramatta Stadium unable to host due to insufficient capacity for the event. Central Coast won 2–0, after losing their past three grand finals. Western Sydney Wanderers reached the grand final again the following year in 2014 with Brisbane Roar hosting for the third time at Suncorp Stadium for the last three of four grand finals since 2011. Brisbane won 2–1 in extra time to win a record third grand final. The Big Blue teams (Melbourne Victory and Sydney FC) reached the grand final for the second time in 2015. Due to Etihad Stadium and Melbourne Cricket Ground being unavailable for the event, AAMI Park became the last option to play host for the 2015 grand final. Melbourne Victory won 3–0; a record equalling third grand final win to the Brisbane Roar. Adelaide United played host for the first time in their third grand final against the Western Sydney Wanderers also in their third in the past four for the 2016 grand final. Adelaide Oval was the chosen venue, instead of Adelaide's usual home ground Coopers Stadium due to bigger capacity and for hosting high-profile matches.[3] Adelaide United won 3–1 to record their first grand final win and the Western Sydney Wanderers' third loss still yet to win.[4]\n\nThe Big Blue teams played the 2017 hosted at Allianz Stadium in Sydney for the fourth time, as Sydney won 4–2 on penalties after a 1–1 draw to equal Brisbane Roar and Melbourne Victory on most grand final wins with three. Newcastle Jets reached the grand final in 2018 after a ten-year drought against the Melbourne Victory hosted at McDonald Jones Stadium for the first time. Victory won 1–0 for a record fourth grand final win. Kosta Barbarouses' 9th-minute goal in the match become the fastest scored in the A-League Men grand final. It also ultimately sparked controversy for the video assistant referee (VAR) that failed to detect an offside for Victory's awarded goal. Perth Glory qualified for their first grand final since 2012 in Brisbane against Sydney FC at Optus Stadium attended by 56,371; the current record of an A-League Men grand final attendance.[5] Sydney won 4–1 on penalties after 0–0 draw; the third time they won on penalties and the record equalling fourth win overall.\n\n2020–present[edit]\nThe 2022 A-League Men Grand Final at AAMI Park.\n\nDuring the 2019–20 A-League season, it was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia and ultimately suspended the season in March 2020. From that point, matches were played behind closed doors, teams travelled interstate, and crowds were restricted for the semi-finals and grand final. These measures caused the entire finals series to be played at Bankwest Stadium (now CommBank Stadium), meaning the 2020 grand final would be first to be hosted at a neutral venue.[6] Whilst originally scheduled for May 2020, it was postponed to August 2020; the first time the A-League Men grand final was played after May. The match was played between Sydney FC and first-timers Melbourne City in a restricted crowd of 7,051. Sydney won 1–0 after extra time to win a record fifth Australian championship and grand final. The same teams met the following year in 2021 with Melbourne City claiming the host at AAMI Park in a 14,017 sell-out crowd of half-capacity,[7] with travelling fans unable to attend due to Sydney's 2021 lockdown. City claimed revenge and won 3–1 to win their first A-League Men grand final. City reached the 2022 grand final for their third consecutive appearance; against locals Western United. It was the first grand final since the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia with no crowd restrictions. Western United won 2–0 to win their first grand final in their third season of existence.\n\nFurther information: Australian Professional Leagues § 2022 Grand Final decision\n\nIt was announced in December 2022, that the 2023, 2024 and 2025 A-Leagues grand finals would be played in Sydney as part of a deal with Destination NSW,[8] breaking the tradition of the highest placed team to host their grand final; the announcement initially being met with universal backlash from fans of all clubs, former players and active support groups.[9][10] The 2023 grand final was then initially set to play at CommBank Stadium which would be the second time it would host there, both times as a neutral venue.[11] Melbourne City and Central Coast Mariners were the participants for this grand final, as Central Coast won 6–1; the second A-League Men grand final where a team scored six goals. Fan controversies continued after the match, for the shape of Melbourne City's disadvantages for the match such as outnumbered fans and not hosting at AAMI Park.[12] The Sydney grand final decision was eventually reversed in October 2023, in replacement of Unite Round.[13]\n\nResults[edit]\nBy final[edit]\nSee also: List of Australian soccer champions § A-League Men (2005–present)\nYear\tDate\tTeam 1\tScore\tTeam 2\tVenue\tAttendance\tJoe Marston Medal\n2006\t5 March\tSydney FC\t1–0\tCentral Coast Mariners\tSydney Football Stadium\t41,689\t Dwight Yorke\n2007\t18 February\tMelbourne Victory\t6–0\tAdelaide United\tTelstra Dome\t55,436\t Archie Thompson\n2008\t24 February\tCentral Coast Mariners\t0–1\tNewcastle Jets\tAussie Stadium\t36,354\t Andrew Durante\n2009\t28 February\tMelbourne Victory\t1–0\tAdelaide United\tTelstra Dome\t53,273\t Tom Pondeljak\n2010\t20 March\tMelbourne Victory\t1–1 (2–4p)\tSydney FC\tEtihad Stadium\t44,560\t Simon Colosimo\n2011\t13 March\tBrisbane Roar\t2–2 (4–2p)\tCentral Coast Mariners\tSuncorp Stadium\t50,168\t Mathew Ryan\n2012\t22 April\tBrisbane Roar\t2–1\tPerth Glory\tSuncorp Stadium\t50,334\t Jacob Burns\n2013\t21 April\tWestern Sydney Wanderers\t0–2\tCentral Coast Mariners\tAllianz Stadium\t42,102\t Daniel McBreen\n2014\t4 May\tBrisbane Roar\t2–1\tWestern Sydney Wanderers\tSuncorp Stadium\t51,153\t Thomas Broich\n Iacopo La Rocca\n2015\t17 May\tMelbourne Victory\t3–0\tSydney FC\tAAMI Park\t29,843\t Mark Milligan\n2016\t1 May\tAdelaide United\t3–1\tWestern Sydney Wanderers\tAdelaide Oval\t50,119\t Isaías\n2017\t7 May\tSydney FC\t1–1 (4–2p)\tMelbourne Victory\tAllianz Stadium\t41,546\t Daniel Georgievski\n2018\t5 May\tNewcastle Jets\t0–1\tMelbourne Victory\tMcDonald Jones Stadium\t29,410\t Lawrence Thomas\n2019\t19 May\tPerth Glory\t0–0 (1–4p)\tSydney FC\tOptus Stadium\t56,371\t Miloš Ninković\n2020\t30 August\tSydney FC\t1–0\tMelbourne City\tBankwest Stadium\t7,051[a]\t Rhyan Grant\n2021\t27 June\tMelbourne City\t3–1\tSydney FC\tAAMI Park\t14,017[b]\t Nathaniel Atkinson\n2022\t28 May\tMelbourne City\t0–2\tWestern United\tAAMI Park\t22,495\t Aleksandar Prijović\n2023\t3 June\tMelbourne City\t1–6\tCentral Coast Mariners\tCommBank Stadium\t26,523\t Jason Cummings\n\nNotes\n\n^ Crowd was restricted to 25% capacity due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia.\n^ Crowd was restricted to 50% capacity due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia.\nBy team[edit]\nClub\tWins\tWinning years\tRunners-up\tRunners-up years\tTotal grand finals\nSydney FC\t5\t2006, 2010, 2017, 2019, 2020\t1\t2015\t6\nMelbourne Victory\t4\t2007, 2009, 2015, 2018\t2\t2010, 2017\t6\nBrisbane Roar\t3\t2011, 2012, 2014\t0\t\t3\nCentral Coast Mariners\t2\t2013, 2023\t3\t2006, 2008, 2011\t5\nMelbourne City\t1\t2021\t3\t2020, 2022, 2023\t4\nAdelaide United\t1\t2016\t2\t2007, 2009\t3\nNewcastle Jets\t1\t2008\t1\t2018\t2\nWestern United\t1\t2022\t0\t\t1\nWestern Sydney Wanderers\t0\t\t3\t2013, 2014, 2016\t3\nPerth Glory\t0\t\t1\t2019\t1\nTrophy and awards[edit]\nChampionship trophy[edit]\nThe A-League Men championship trophy\nSee also: A-League Men § Logo and trophies\n\nThe A-League Men's championship trophy is the main prize for winning the grand final and being crowned champions. Designed by Sydney design company D3 Design, it resembles a laurel wreath. \"We used this model as a basis for a unique, cutting-edge design – our trophy is a modern and versatile translation of the wreath. The winners can hold it above their heads as a symbol of success\".\" It is nicknamed the \"Toilet Seat\" due to its shape.[14][15][16]\n\nJoe Marston Medal[edit]\nMain article: Joe Marston Medal\n\nThe Joe Marston Medal is the award given to the player of the match of the A-League Men grand final. It is named after Joe Marston who played for the Australia men's national soccer team from 1947 to 1958 and a member of Preston North End in the 1954 FA Cup final.\n\nIt has been awarded ever since the 1980 NSL season which was first won by Abbas Saad with Sydney Olympic. Until the A-League Men was formed, Dwight Yorke with Sydney FC became the first to win the Joe Marston Medal under the A-League Men. Currently, no one has won the award more than once in the A-League Men era.\n\nStadiums[edit]\n\nThe stadiums of an A-League Men grand final varies through the highest placed semi-final winning team to host in their own vicinity. Two exceptions have occurred in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia and 2023 due to the Sydney grand final decision; both of which have been played at Western Sydney Stadium.\n\nMultiple instances have occurred where clubs' home stadiums are deemed insufficient to host the grand final and instead move to a venue with more capacity in their vicinity. Examples include Central Coast Mariners in 2007 hosting at Sydney Football Stadium instead of Central Coast Stadium; and Western Sydney Wanderers in 2013 also hosting at Sydney Football Stadium instead of Parramatta Stadium.\n\nStadium\tLocation\tNo. hosted\tYears hosted\nSydney Football Stadium\tSydney\t4\t2006, 2008, 2013, 2017\nDocklands Stadium\tMelbourne\t3\t2007, 2009, 2010\nLang Park\tBrisbane\t3\t2011, 2012, 2014\nMelbourne Rectangular Stadium\tMelbourne\t3\t2015, 2021, 2022\nWestern Sydney Stadium\tSydney\t2\t2020, 2023\nAdelaide Oval\tAdelaide\t1\t2016\nNewcastle International Sports Centre\tNewcastle\t1\t2018\nPerth Stadium\tPerth\t1\t2019\n\nItalics: Neutral venue\n\nTelevision broadcast[edit]\nAustralian television viewers\nYear\tViewers\tNetwork\tRef.\nPay\tFTA\n2007\t282,000\tFox Sports\t—\t[17]\n2013\t297,000\t—\t[18]\n2014\t772,000\tSBS\t[19]\n2015\t442,000\t[20]\n2017\t553,000\t[21]\n2019\t406,000\tNetwork 10\t[22]\n2020\t173,000\tABC TV\t[23]\n2023\t264,000\tParamount+\tNetwork 10\t[24]\nReferences[edit]\n^ Lucas, Adam (5 March 2006). \"Sydney FC prevails\".

(December 2023)\nLanjisu internet cafe fire\nLocation of the fire in Beijing\n\nDate\tJune 16, 2002\nTime\t02:40 (CST)\nCoordinates\t39.997°N 116.361°E\nType\tArson\nDeaths\t25\nNon-fatal injuries\t13\n\nAt around 2:40 AM on June 16, 2002, a fire broke out at a two-story internet cafe in Haidian district, Beijing. 25 people died and 13 others were injured. Many of the dead and injured people were university students. The fire was the deadliest fire in Beijing in over 50 years. The fire was an arson; four youngsters were punished for the crime.\n\nBackground[edit]\nAn internet cafe in China in 2006.\n\nLanjisu (\"Blue Speed\") internet cafe was an unlicensed two-story establishment located in Haidian, Beijing's university district. At the time, illegal internet cafes were common: according to authorities, only 200 out of 2,400 internet cafes in the city had permits.[1][2] The operator was Zheng Wenjing, a 36-year-old engineer, assisted by his girlfriend Zhang Minmin.[3]\n\nTwo boys, 14-year-old Song and 13-year-old Zhang, confessed to lighting the fire out of revenge after a dispute with staff. On television news, one of the boys was shown telling investigators \"I burned the Lanjisu with gasoline because they would not let us play there.\"[2] The boys plotted the arson two weeks in advance.[4]\n\nFire[edit]\n\nSong and Zhang purchased 1.8 liters of gasoline from a nearby gas station at 11:00 PM on June 15, a few hours before setting fire to the internet cafe.[4]\n\nThe fire broke out at 2:40 in the morning.[3] At the time, the cafe was crowded. Making matters worse, the windows of the cafe had been barred and there was just one door, which was kept locked.[2] The fire was put out by 3:30 AM.[4] The fire claimed 25 lives, and 13 were injured. Many of the victims were students from eight nearby universities.[3] The fire was the deadliest in Beijing in more than 50 years.[5]\n\nConsequences[edit]\n\nBeijing Mayor Liu Qi ordered Beijing internet cafes to close for safety inspections. Only properly licensed establishments would be allowed to reopen.[5]\n\nCafe owner Zhang Wenjing turned himself in.[5] For illegally operating the cafe, he was sentenced to 3 years in prison and was fined 300,000 yuan. His girlfriend Zhang Minmin was sentenced to 1 year and 6 months in prison, and was fined 200,000 yuan.[3] The gas station which sold the teenagers the gasoline was fined 50,000 yuan.[6]\n\nOf the four culprits, two boys were sentenced to life in prison, a female accomplice was sentenced to 12-year prison term, and another boy was sent to a Beijing reform school.[1]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b Watts, Jonathan (30 August 2002). \"Boys jailed for deadly fire at illegal internet cafe\".

(December 2023)\nThe South Carolina State House.\nSouth Carolina solicitor David Pascoe, who served as Attorney General when Alan Wilson recused himself from the State Grand Jury investigation of the Quinndom case.\n\nQuinndom was the nickname of a Grand Jury investigation into the South Carolina General Assembly from 2013 to 2021. By the end of the investigation, four members of the South Carolina General Assembly were indicted on public corruption charges. \"Quinndom\" is often considered the most significant political scandal in the history of the state of South Carolina since Operation Lost Trust in 1989. Lost Trust directly influenced the passing of South Carolina's Ethics Reform Act of 1991, and led to the restructuring of the state government in 1993. The Quinndom scandal raised questions about the effectiveness of that reform in the face of dark money influence.[1]\n\nInvestigation[edit]\n\nIn 2013\n\nIn 2014\n\nIn 2015\n\nIn 2016\n\nIn 2017\n\nIndictments[edit]\n\nBobby Harrell - former Speaker of the House Robert 'Bobby' Harrell pled guilty to six counts, resigned from his seat in the House.[2]\n\nJames H.

While he was not implicated in the corruption probe, McMaster was not immediately able to appoint replacements to retiring board members of the South Carolina Port Authority. The authority also contracted with Richard Quinn. After SCPA ended their contracts with Quinn, the State legislature allowed the appointments to go forward. McMaster subsequently ended his contract with Quinn.[10][11][12][13]\n\nCorporate Accountability[edit]\n\nFive corporations - the University of South Carolina, AT&T, SCANA, Palmetto Health, and the South Carolina Alliance for Justice, signed corporate integrity agreements with Pascoe to pay a fine and admit no wrongdoing in exchange for no prosecution.[14]\n\nFormer Senator John Courson with Fred Thompson in 2007.\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"Unredacted 28th State Grand Jury Report\".

The Regalia from the Zogu family consisted of royal symbols and artifacts that represented the monarchy's power and heritage. These regal symbols were emblematic of Albania's monarchy during the reign of the House of Zogu and held significant historical and cultural value for the country.\n\n\n\n\nArms of Skanderbeg[edit]\nThe helmet (crown) of the Albanian warrior king, Skanderbeg, made in 1460.\n\t\nThis section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (December 2023) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\n\nThe Helmet(crown) of Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg, was created for the medieval Feudal Lord in the 15th century, was smuggled out of Albania by members of the Kastrioti noble family. After the Occupation from the Ottoman Empire. Skanderbeg's helmet is made of white metal, adorned with a strip dressed in gold. On its top lies the head of a horned goat made of bronze, also dressed in gold. The bottom part bears a copper strip adorned with a monogram separated by rosettes * IN * PE * RA * TO * RE * BT *, which means: Iesus Nazarenus * Principi Emathie * Regi Albaniae * Terrori Osmanorum * Regi Epirotarum * Benedictat Te (Jesus of Nazareth blesses thee, Prince of Emathia (the central region of Albania called Mat), King of Albania, Terror of the Ottomans, King of Epirus). The crown found its way into the collections of the Habsburg dynasty via an Italian noble family and it currently resides in the Imperial Treasury in Vienna, Austria. In 1931, King Zog I made a very rare foreign tour and visited Vienna in an unsuccessful attempt to regain the crown, for a future coronation he even considered giving himself the regnal name \"Skanderbeg III\" when being crowned. Skanderbeg's helmet gave inspiration to the many Tiaras and Diadems that would be commissioned by the Zogu Family.\n\nHouse of Zogu Regalia[edit]\n\nThe Regalia for the Zogu Family was created when Zog I of Albania in 1928 self-proclaimed himself King of the Albanians and began his rule. He commissioned a regal ensemble for his coronation, featuring rose-colored breeches, gold spurs, and a gold crown weighing seven and five-eighths pounds.[1] That same year there were tiaras commissioned for Zog I of Albania sisters. They were made for Princess Senije, Princess Myzejen, Princess Ruhije and Princess Maxhide. While Princess Adile and Princess Nafije did not receive any tiaras due to being already married when their brother Zog I of Albania became King.[2] In 1930 the diadem of the Princesses of Albania was created by Töpfert Vienna. It was created for one of Zog I of Albania sisters the princesses but nothing further is known about the jewel. Its whereabouts are unknown today.[3]Shortly after getting engaged then getting married to Zog I of Albania. Geraldine of Albania received the Royal Diamond Tiara at the wedding in 1938. Her tiara had 28.05 carats of old European and single-cut diamonds and 4.80 carats of baguette diamonds, the tiara has a floral base relating to her being called the \"The White Rose of Hungary\" and is topped with a diamond ram's head relating to Skanderbeg.[4][5] In 1939 the House of Zogu was deposed by Victor Emmanuel III of Italy during the Italian invasion of 1939. Victor assumed the Albanian throne. While in their exile King Zog was suffering from stomach cancer and required treatment for which the family had little money. Queen Geraldine was forced to sell most of her regalia. Including the Oak Leave tiara and Floral tiara as well as the jewelry except she kept earrings. [6]In 1961 King Zog died in exile and was succeeded as claimant to the throne and head of the house of Zogu was his only son Leka, Crown Prince of Albania who became self-proclaimed King of the Albanians. In the early 1970s the Queen Susan tiara diadem was commissioned by Leka, Crown Prince of Albania and designed by the Iranian imperial family. The tiara was first worn by Geraldine of Albania at the wedding of her son Leka, Crown Prince of Albania and Susan Cullen-Ward. It was then given to Susan Cullen-Ward when she became queen.[7][8] After the Passing of Leka, Crown Prince of Albania, Leka, Prince of Albania became the sole heir to the Albanian Crown. On October 8th, 2016 Leka, Prince of Albania married Elia, Princess of Albania where she became Crown Princess Elia of the Albanians. She inherited the Tiara that was worn by Susan Cullen-Ward and Geraldine of Albania.[9][10]\n\nGallery[edit]\n\nRoyal Regalia of the House of Zogu\n\nThe Lost Diadem of the Princesses of Albania\n \nOne of four identical Oak leave Tiaras commissioned for the four Albanian Princesses\n \nZog I of Albania sword used at the wedding\n \nGeraldine and the Princesses wearing the Oak leave Tiaras\n \nGeraldine of Albania wearing the Royal Floral Tiara\n \nThe Oak leave Coronation Tiara of Queen Geraldine\n \nPrincess Ruhije wearing the family regalia\n \nThe Regalia sold by Geraldine\n \nThe Regalia sold by Geraldine\n \nThe Tiara worn by Queen Geraldine,Queen Susan and currently Elia, Princess of Albania\nSee also[edit]\nHistory of Albania\nList of Albanian monarchs\nKingdom of Albania\nReferences[edit]\nExternal links[edit]\n[11]\nshow\nvte\nNational symbols of Albania \nshow\nvte\nCrowns\nshow\nvte\nRegalia and crown jewels by country"}

It is believed to work by inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), a key enzyme the SARS-CoV-2 needs to replicate.[1][2][3][4]\n\nMechanism of action[edit]\n\nOlgotrelvir is a prodrug that first converts to its active form, AC1115.[2] AC1115 is believed to work by inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (also known as 3C-like protease). This protein is a crucial enzyme responsible for cleaving viral polyproteins into functional subunits essential for viral replication. By binding to the active site of the protease, the drug prevents this cleavage process, effectively halting viral assembly and impeding the virus's ability to produce future virions.[1][2][3]\n\nOlgotrelvir also appears to inhibit cathepsin L,[2] a protein implicated in facilitating viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell.[2][5]\n\nClinical trials[edit]\n\nIn September 2023, the drug's developer, Sorrento Therapeutics, announced top-line data that olgotrelvir had met its primary endpoints in a phase III clinical trial that enrolled 1,212 patients with mild or moderate COVID-19. The drug appeared to shorten the recovery time of 11 COVID-19 symptoms in olgotrelvir-treated patients by 2.4 days on average compared to patients in the placebo group. The drug was also shown to reduce the viral load at day 4 in treated patients compared to the placebo group. Side effects were mostly mild and infrequent, with the most common being nausea (1.5% vs. 0.2%) and skin rash (3.3% vs. 0.3%), which occurred more often in the olgotrelvir group.[6]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b Tong X, Keung W, Arnold LD, Stevens LJ, Pruijssers AJ, Kook S, Lopatin U, Denison M, Kwong AD (November 2023). \"Evaluation of in vitro antiviral activity of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor pomotrelvir and cross-resistance to nirmatrelvir resistance substitutions\".

The genre is entrenched within the cultural fabric of the Nsukka people in Enugu State, Nigeria.[1] The traditional folk genre encapsulates a distinctive cultural tradition characterized by a symphony of specific musical elements and intricate performance practices.[2][3] At the heart of Ikorodo music lies a set of horns known as opi, revered for their melodic resonance and pivotal role in orchestrating complex rhythmic patterns through the application of hocket technique.[4] Alongside these wind instruments, the ensemble embraces a harmonious amalgamation of percussive elements, including the resounding beats of the okpokolo, the lively cadence of osha rattles, and the reverberating tones of alo and igba.[5] Moreover, this musical tradition isn't solely aural; it intertwines seamlessly with visual expressions as young maidens partake in a graceful dance, infusing vibrancy into the melodic tapestry.[6] Ikorodo music holds a sacred place within the community's ceremonies, cultural festivities, and communal gatherings, embodying not only a melodic cadence but also serving as a vessel for cultural preservation, unity, and the transmission of ancestral legacies across generations.\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ Opara, Ruth; Agbo, Benedict (October 1, 2022). \"Music, Seduction, and New Beginnings: The Ikorodo Maiden Dance of Nsukka\".

It was declared Cultural heritage of Peru.\n\nHighlights include its stone doorway, the only one of its kind in the city, the two-section hallway and the imperial staircase, which separates the main patio from the backyard, placed in the central axis of the house.[1]\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nThere are two theories about the origin of its name: one refers to its structural similarity to a house of the same name located in Seville,[3] while the other is included by Ricardo Palma in his Peruvian Traditions, where he tells the story of a tenant, a Portuguese Jew called Pilatos by the people of Lima, who was accused by the Court of the Inquisition of carrying out profane ceremonies with sacred images.[4] It was built around 1590;[4] the second floor was rebuilt in the mid-19th century.[1]\n\nThe house has been occupied by various families of the aristocracy of Lima, being the home of the Marquises of San Lorenzo del Vallehumbroso who moved to this property in 1780, leaving their mansion in Cuzco.[5][6] until the Peruvian State bought it during the second government of Manuel Prado Ugarteche.\n\nFor a long time, it was the headquarters of the House of Culture of Peru (and its successor) during the military government of Ricardo Pérez Godoy. After the promulgation of the 1993 Constitution, the local headquarters of the Constitutional Court of Peru was installed there in 1996.[4]\n\nSee also[edit]\nConstitutional Court of Peru\nCasa de Pilatos\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c Velasco García, María del Rosario (2016). \"La casa virreinal limeña\".

The law has been described as providing a legal framework for the process of the decolonization of Ukraine, which began after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[1][2]\n\nBackground[edit]\nMain article: Derussification in Ukraine\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine that began in 2022 has increased the rate of derussification in Ukraine, especially the removal of names associated with Russia and Russian imperialism. Ukrainian advocates for the process refer to it as decolonization.[3][4] Street names associated with Russia were changed in major Ukrainian cities like Lviv, Dnipro,[5] Kyiv,[6] and Kharkiv. Ivano-Frankivsk became the first city to completely remove all its Russian toponyms.[7]\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nOn April 5, 2022, the Verkhovna Rada registered a draft law of an amendment to the laws of Ukraine regarding decolonization of toponymy and regulating use of geographic names of populated places.[8] On April 12, 2022, Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, said that the total derussification of many spheres of Ukrainian society was inevitable, claiming \"we won't have anything Russian left here\".[9]\n\nOn March 14, 2023, a number of public organizations signed a petition calling on the Verkhovna Rada to adopt a law on decolonization in parliament.[10]\n\nOn March 21, 2023, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted the law.[11] It passed with 248 votes.[12] On April 21, 2023, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed the law.[13] On July 27, 2023, the law entered into force.[2]\n\nContents and implementation[edit]\n\t\nThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (December 2023)\nFurther information: List of Ukrainian toponyms that were changed as part of derussification\n\nThe law prohibits \"publicly honoring and promoting names with symbols of Russian imperial policy, its landmarks, memorable, historical, and cultural places, settlements, dates, events, and representatives.\" The law requires that as of January 27, 2024, all toponyms related to the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, or the Russian Federation be removed from places in Ukraine.[14]\n\nThe law provides a list of steps to be taken by local authorities in the process. Local councils are instructed to form a commission, of whom at least half are members of the public (activists and academics), then collect and process proposals for new names. The commissions will be required to communicate with citizens about the new toponyms, which \"will allow choosing the most appropriate version of the name that will meet the request of residents or the historical features of the area\". Documents like birth certificates and real estate are not required to be updated to match new names.[14]\n\nThe law also requires that toponyms that have been Russified in the past must be brought in line with Ukrainian spelling, listing Yuzhne, Sievierodonetsk, and Yuzhnoukrainsk as examples.[15]\n\nIn addition to toponyms, imperial monuments are also to be removed from public spaces. Types of monuments to be removed include those \"dedicated to persons who held senior positions in government and administrative bodies, political organisations, parties, armed formations of State entities of Russia and who participated in or contributed to the implementation of Russian imperial policy\", as well as those \"dedicated to individuals who publicly supported, glorified or justified Russian imperial policies, called for Russification or Ukrainophobia.\"[15]\n\nOn November 20, 2023, the Ukrainian Institute of National Memory prepared a collection of recommendations and documents regarding how the requirements of the law would be carried out.[16]\n\nSee also[edit]\nDecommunization in Ukraine\nList of Ukrainian toponyms that were changed as part of decommunization\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"Новини комітетів - \"Декомунізація запустила процеси суттєвої зміни ставлення громадян до нашої історичної пам'яті.

It was nominated for the 2022 Hugo Award for Best Novella.\n\nPlot[edit]\n\nEarth sends generation ships to space to establish colony worlds. After Earth's society collapses, these colonies are separated from their home planet. Centuries later, Earth rebuilds and seeks information about these lost colonies. Nyr Illim Tevich is an anthropologist from Earth, currently living on the colony world Sophos 4. His foremost instruction is non-intervention; he is to record the history and culture of the planet without interacting.\n\nLynesse “Lyn” Fourth Daughter is a princess of the Royal Line of Lannesite. She and Esha Free Mark visit the Tower of Nyrgoth Elder, who they view as a powerful and ancient sorcerer. Lyn requests that Nyr honor a promise made to her great-grandmother. (A century ago, Nyr had helped the queen Astresse fight off a warlord, in violation of his instructions). Nyr wakes from suspension to find that Earth has not contacted him in the previous three centuries. Lyn tells Nyr that a demon is attacking the countryside; he agrees to help.\n\nLyn promises a crowd of villagers that Nyr will save them from the demon. Nyr snaps and tells her that there is no such thing as magic. He tells them the true story about their colony's origins. Due to cultural and linguistic barriers, Lyn and Esha do not understand his concerns.\n\nThey are led to the demon's location by a man named Allwer. Along the way, they see wildlife and humans mutilated and combined into various shapes; the “demon” is infecting them and changing them. Nyr cannot understand the entity, believing it to be similar to a virus. He learns that the demonic infection is transmitted through radiation. Esha contracts the disease, but Nyr is able to restrict the infection's EM field and save her. They find an arch that leads to an unknown dimension; the radiation is coming from within.\n\nLyn cuts some of Nyr's equipment out of his body; Nyr uses the anthropologists’ anti-contamination measures to destroy the arch with a missile from a satellite. Because of this, Nyr is permanently cut off from contact with his satellite and gives up hope of ever hearing from Earth. He decides that he will no longer be a detached anthropologist, but will instead return to the queen's court with Lyn and experience life firsthand.\n\nMajor themes[edit]\n\nAccording to Lucy Nield, language barriers and cultural differences play a large role in the story. The split narrative, alternating between Nyr's chapters and Lyn's chapters, allows the reader to \"comprehend the intention of each character\". Nield also gives an example of scenes in which the language barrier is apparent in the narrative:\n\nNyr’s hypothesis is that, should he attempt to dispel Lyn and Esha of their belief that he is an ancient wizard, he might end up saying “I’m not a wizard; I’m a wizard, or at best a wizard,” an imagined interaction that he finds less than amusing.[1]\n\nIn a later scene, Nyr violates the principle role of anthropology and tells Lyn and Esha the truth about the history of Sophos 4.\n\nNyr tells stories of humans arriving from Earth, then adapting to their new planet, engineering body modifications for humans and the native livestock, as well as the machinery used in the colonisation process, but all Esha and Lyn hear is that the Elders used “magic” to travel from the “otherworld” (111) and began “teaching the beasts and plants their place, naming them and giving them their roles,” and about the “monsters” that did the will of men (112). Nyr tries his best to remove magic from the conversation, but once he is finished, Lyn simply states, “yes, that is how we tell it,” unable to grasp the concepts he has tried so delicately and desperately to explain (115).[1]\n\nNield concludes by stating that Tchaikovsky uses these juxtapositions to explore ideas including Arthur C. Clarke's well-known adage that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Furthermore, Tchaikovsky uses the language and cultural barriers to draw distinctions between science fiction and fantasy genre tropes.[1]\n\nTobias Carroll of Tor.com also writes about the language barrier present in the novel; sometimes, it is used for comedic effect. Nyr's translations into Lyn's dialect are always \"a little fancier\" than intended. For example, Nyr intends to say “Why are you here?”, but Lynesse hears “For what purpose do you disturb the Elder?”[2]\n\nCarroll also discusses the way in which Nyr's experience with clinical depression impacts the narrative. Nyr has a modified biochemical system called the Dissociative Cognition System (DBS) which can separate him from his own emotional experiences. Nyr attempts to describe depression to Lyn, but there is no word for it in her language.[2]\n\nStyle[edit]\n\nThe story alternates between the viewpoints of Lyn and Nyr. Lyn's chapters are told in third person, while Nyr's are narrated in first person.[3]\n\nBackground[edit]\n\nThe novella was inspired by Gene Wolfe's 1967 short story Trip, Trap. Trip, Trap also features a dual narrative split between a fantasy-medieval setting and a futuristic setting headlined by an anthropologist.[1][2]\n\nReception[edit]\n\nLucy Nield of the Science Fiction Research Association praised Tchaikovsky as a \"commanding, imaginative writer, who can master and manipulate genre is any way he sees fit\".[1]\n\nWriting for Locus, Russell Lesson called the book a \"tale with a lot of heart\" and praised its mashup of the science fiction and fantasy genres.[3] Publishers Weekly called Tchaikovsky a \"master of the genre mash-up\", writing that he \"wows with this inventive and empathetic story of courage, science, and magic\".[4]\n\nA review for Tor.com called the novella's conclusion \"unexpectedly moving\" and praised the growth of the relationship between Lyn and Nyr over the course of the story.[2]\n\nElder Race was nominated for the 2022 Hugo Award for Best Novella.[5]\n\nSee also[edit]\nElder race\nPrime directive\nReferences[edit]\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c d e Lucy Nield (27 Apr 2023). \"Review of Elder Race\".

(December 2023)\n\nBarry Billcliff (born August 9, 1982) is an American former national wrestler who won the 1996 FHSAA Wrestling Competition. He was part of the American wrestling team from 1995 to 1999. He also participated in the junior Olympics.[1][2][3]\n\nBillcliff got national coverage and appeared on talk shows after he and his friend claimed to have found buried treasure.[4]\n\nBuried treasure case[edit]\n\nBillcliff along with Timothy Crebase, Matt Ingham, and Kevin Kozak, claimed to have discovered a buried treasure while doing a roofing job in Newbury.[5][6]\n\nThe stash included 1,800 bank notes dating from 1899 to 1928, valued at up to $125,000.[7]\n\nBillcliff was arrested and charged with stealing the currency. Most of the money was recovered, and the family owning the property expressed surprise at being thrust into the story.[8][9]\n\nBillcliff's planned TV appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! was interrupted due to his arrest.[10][11]\n\nThe charges were dropped against Billcliff and Tim Crebase. Legal proceedings started in 2006, and the case was dismissed twice.

He rose to fame through Roja Malare (1997), and has gone on to make feature films including the dramas Adada Enna Azhagu (2009) and Thee Ivan (2023).\n\nCareer[edit]\n\nJayamurugan first entered the Tamil film industry as a producer, making Sindhu Bath (1995) through his production house Manithan Cine Arts.[1] Jayamurugan made his directorial debut through the romantic drama film Roja Malare (1997) starring Murali, Arun Pandian and Anand Babu in the lead roles. Prior to release, the film garnered attention for its shoot in St. Mary's Islands.[2] Upon release, the film received mixed reviews from film critics.[3] In the late 1990s, he made a film called Poonguyile with Livingston, Udhaya and Vindhya, which was shelved after several schedules.[4][5]\n\nJayamurugan re-emerged in the late 2000s by directing Adada Enna Azhagu (2009) starring Jai Akash and Nicole. The film opened to negative reviews, with a critic from Sify noting \"there is nothing to recommend in the film. Keep away\".[6] Entertainment portal Behindwoods.com rated the film 0.5 out of 5 and wrote, \"Adada Enna Azhagu is so fake and out of place that you end up feeling you are time-transported two decades earlier\".[7][8]\n\nIn early 2020, Jayamurugan announced another comeback and noted that he was making a film titled Thee Ivan (2023) with Karthik and his son, Suman, in the lead roles.[9] He noted that he would keep the livelihood of people hailing from the Kongu Seemai region as the backdrop, and that it would deal with the bond between a brother and sister.[10] The film eventually had a delayed release in 2023, with a song from Sunny Leone added to the project.[11]\n\nFilmography[edit]\nFilms\nYear\tFilm\tNotes\n1997\tRoja Malare\t\n2009\tAdada Enna Azhagu\talso composer\n2023\tThee Ivan\talso composer\nProducer[edit]\nSindhu Bath (1995)\nReferences[edit]\n^ https://silverscreenindia.com/movies/news/actor-karthik-turns-hero-once-again-for-thee-ivan/\n^ \"A-Z (V)\".

Similarly, Pope Benedict XIII of Avignon, the Aragonese Papa Luna, lends his support by issuing the Crusade Bull in March 1398. This collective effort garners the support of additional towns and cities, pooling resources and contributing to the fundraising and recruitment efforts for troops and ships, ultimately facilitating the assault on Tedelis,[5] Initiated from the city of Valencia and supported by other regions in the Kingdom of Valencia and Mallorca, the expedition received backing from Pope Luna, who issued a crusade bull facilitating support, resources, and funds. The outcome was a fleet concentrated in Ibiza, amassing 70 ships and 7,500 crusaders.[4] Setting sail in August, they plundered Tedelis, resulting in the death of 1,000 residents and the capture of 300 others.[6]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ Colón, Germán; Massot i Muntaner, Josep, eds.

Helble\nOccupation\tAcademic\nYears active\t2018 - Present\nKnown for\tDean of Thayer School of Engineering\nPresident of Lehigh University\n\nJoseph J. Helble is an American academic that has served as the provost of Dartmouth College from 2005 to 2018, as dean of Dartmouth's Thayer School of Engineering from 2018 to 2021, and as President of Lehigh University since 2021.\n\nEarly life[edit]\n\nHelble is a Lehigh graduate from the class of 1982. A student in the P.C. Rosin engineering school with a degree in chemical engineering, he also worked as a Gryphon. He gradated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1987 with a PhD in chemical engineering. He worked in the private sector for Physical Sciences, Inc., as well as working as a science policy fellow for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, as well as being named a Revelle Fellow. Authoring over 100 scientific papers and three books, he was also awarded the National Academy of Engineering's 2014 Bernard M. Gordon Prize for Innovation in Engineering and Technology Education. He also received the National Science Foundation's CAREER award in 1998.[1]\n\nAcademic leadership[edit]\nDarthmouth[edit]\n\nFrom 2018 to 2021 Helble was the provost of Dartmouth College, and from 2005 to 2018. He was also the dean of Dartmouth's Thayer School of Engineering from 2018 to 2021.[2]\n\nLehigh[edit]\n\nOn July 30, 2021, Lehigh University President John D. Simon stepped down with provost Nathan Urban acting as president until Joseph J. Helble assumed the office on August 16 during homecoming weekend or Founders Weekend.[3][4]\n\nHelble's naming as president was well received by the engineering alumni and students of Lehigh due to Helble's former office of Provost of Dartmouth's Engineering school. Additionally, Helble's predecessor, John D. Simon, clashed frequently with the student body, with the conflict coming to a head with the school's COVID policy, as such, students were optimistic that Helble's leadership would usher in a new period of Student-Administration relationships.[5]\n\nEntering his term he stated that he supported the policies of former President Simon and that the College of Health is the immediate priority of his initial administration. He also stated that he would increase the transparency between the school and the students, and will strive to make the school more politically neutral and increase it's academic rankings.[6] He also stated that he seeks to improve interdisciplinary studies between the different schools at Lehigh.[7]\n\nIn November 2022 a 22-year old Black Lehigh University student was harassed and attacked by a pair of white assailants who used racist epithets. No charges were pressed and both the Lehigh University Police Department (LUPD) and the Bethlehem Police Department (BPD) determined that the attack wasn't racially motivated.[8] In the following spring semester, Helble issued an update on the situation and stated that “As we begin a new semester, I want to express my continued commitment to providing such an environment where discrimination and racism, hate, and violence, have no home.”[9]\n\nIn an effort to drive student engagement, Helble has hosted a series called Community Conversation, where he informs the student body about changing school policy. During which he announced the restructuring of the school's Title IX office, integrating Diversity, equity, and inclusion into the school's strategic vision and coining the term \"radical interdisciplinarity\" when describing Lehigh's undergraduate and graduate learning programs.[10]\n\nAt a presentation of the yearly action plan in June 2023, Helble announced that the school was going to cooperate more with the Bethlehem city government, namely by informing the council on issues developing at the school prior to official school releases and consulting with the city council for future action plans.[11]\n\nIn April 2023, Helble announced that the school would be purchasing three historic Lutheran churches and opening discussions with the Lehigh community for their fate.[12]\n\nOn October 3, 2023, Helble announced that families making less than $75,000 per year would be able to attend Lehigh for free in the form of a new tuition grant called \"The Lehigh Commitment\" that works towards ensuring a \"Lehigh for everyone\".[13]\n\nOn November 3, 2023, Helble announced Lehigh would be increasing their \"Go Beyond\" fundraiser from $1 billion to include an additional $1.25 billion by 2028. Stating that the funds are needed for continued expansion of student housing and the College of Health as well as expanding community outreach programs.[14]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\n\nHelble is married to Rebecca Dabora, a manufacturing officer at Adagio Therapeutics, and has three children.[1] Helble is an active runner, having competed in the Boston Marathon. Helble uses his running to host \"Pace the Prez\" events where Lehigh students have an opportunity to go on a morning run with him.[7][15]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ a b \"Joseph J.

Floto was the namesake for the Sells Floto Circus, despite the fact he was not involved in the circus.\n\nBiography[edit]\n\nOtto Clement Floto was born in Cincinnati in 1863.[1] In early 1896, he moved to Cripple Creek, Colorado. Before becoming a sports editor, he worked as a billposter and saloon owner. While living in Cripple Creek, he dated a dance hall worker named Jennie LaRue.[1] On April 25, an argument between them resulted in an oil lamp being thrown at a curtain, which started a fire that burned down most buildings on the street.[2]\n\nFloto was hired to The Denver Post by Harry Heye Tammen as a columnist for sports journalism. Floto was barely literate, and his articles had to be rewritten by other editors.[3]\n\nFloto worked as an advisor for Jack Dempsey[1] and John L. Sullivan.[4] He was a rival to Denver sports journalist Bat Masterson, after Floto duped him in a business deal. In July 1900, they got into a street brawl where they kicked each other in the groin.[3]\n\nIn 1903, when Tammen and Frederick Gilmer Bonfils bought the Sells Brothers Circus, Tammen renamed it to the \"Sells Floto Circus\", despite the fact that Floto was never involved in the circus. The reason for the name change was that Tammen liked the name Floto.[5]\n\nFloto died of epilepsy on July 14, 1929, in Denver, Colorado.[6]\n\nReferences[edit]\n^ a b c Collins, Jan MacKell (2004).

{"date": "2023-12-27-22-39", "error": false, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichronauts", "text_blocks": "Dichronauts is a hard science-fiction novel by Australian author Greg Egan published in 2017. The novel describes a universe with two time dimensions, one of which correcponds to the time perception of the characters while the other influences their space perception, for example by rotations in this directions to be impossible. Hence a symbiosis of two life forms is necessary, so that they can even see in all directions. Furthermore, many fundamental laws of physics are altered crucially: Objects can roll uphill or not fall over any more when oriented suitably. There is negative kinetic energy and a forth state of matter. Planets are no longer spherical, but hyperbolic and therefore have three separate surfaces. The details are described by Greg Egan on his website.[1]\n\nPlot[edit]\n\nIn the world of Dichronauts, there are two types of beings living in symbiosis with each other: Walkers, who can only see to the west (or east when turning around), provide mobility, while Siders, leech-like creatures running through their skulls, provide additional sight to the north and south. Every city is in a permanent state of migration to follow the sun's shiftig orbit and the narrow habitable zone it creates. The Walker Seth and his Sider Theo from the city of Baharabad at the river Zirona join an expedition to the edge of the habitable zone to map safe routes ahead. They encounter a river with the city of Thanton nearby, in which the Walkers seemed to have used poison against their Siders. Seth talks with Theo about their symbiosis. Previously, his sister Elena got pregnant pushing her Sider Irina to abandon her, leaving her side-blind and with a hole in her head. Theo calls through Thanton in the language of the Siders not audible for Walkers and suspects the presence of Sleepsiders, pushing him to ask Seth about Sleepwalkers. Both agree to return to the expedition, where a vote decides against the return to Baharabad and for more explorations. Soon after, the expedition reaches a cliff without another side or bottom visible and suspects to have reached the end of the world.\n\nBackground (literature)[edit]\n\nDichronauts describes the dual situation to the earlier published Orthogonal trilogy by Greg Egan (composed of The Clockwork Rocket from 2011,[2] The Eternal Flame from 2012[3] and The Arrows of Time from 2013[4]) about a universe without any time dimensions at all. In the former, the characters perceive a space dimension as time and in the latter, the characters perceive a time dimension as space.\n\nBackground (mathematics and physics)[edit]\n\nMathematically, the difference between our universe and the Dichronauts universe is just a single sign switched in the signature of the metric of flat spacetime. Our universe has signature \n(\n−\n,\n+\n,\n+\n,\n+\n)\n and the Dichronauts universe has signature \n(\n−\n,\n−\n,\n+\n,\n+\n)\n. A sign change in the signature can be shown in a simplified way by the restriction to two dimensions. A scalar product with signature \n(\n+\n,\n+\n)\n on \n𝑅\n2\n (with the canonical basis) is given by:\n\n𝑅\n2\n×\n𝑅\n2\n→\n𝑅\n2\n,\n(\n𝑥\n1\n\n\n𝑦\n1\n)\n⋅\n(\n𝑥\n2\n\n\n𝑦\n2\n)\n=\n𝑥\n1\n𝑥\n2\n+\n𝑦\n1\n𝑦\n2\n.\n\nA scalar product with signature \n(\n+\n,\n−\n)\n on \n𝑅\n2\n (with the canonical basis) is given by:\n\n𝑅\n2\n×\n𝑅\n2\n→\n𝑅\n2\n,\n(\n𝑥\n1\n\n\n𝑦\n1\n)\n⋅\n(\n𝑥\n2\n\n\n𝑦\n2\n)\n=\n𝑥\n1\n𝑥\n2\n−\n𝑦\n1\n𝑦\n2\n.\n\nThe vectors \n(\n1\n,\n0\n)\n and \n(\n0\n,\n1\n)\n are orthogonal to each other (meaning their scalar product vanishes) other for both signatures. But given the vector \n(\n2\n,\n1\n)\n, the orthogonal direction is spanned by the vector \n(\n−\n1\n,\n2\n)\n for the first and \n(\n1\n,\n2\n)\n for the second signature. An interactive applet about the movement and rotation of objects in the Dichronauts universe is available on Greg Egan's website.[5] Only the second signature allows for a vector like \n(\n1\n,\n1\n)\n to be orthogonal to itself. Such vectors describe the propagation of light, for example in this case that one light-year is traveled in one year by definition. In the universe of Dichronauts, this leads to the fact, that not the entire space is filled with light, but that there are two dark cones in opposite directions. Calculations and illustrations of this effect are shown on Greg Egan's website.[6]\n\nA fundamental change between our universe and the Dichronauts universe can be seen in mechanics, where a ramp will act upon an object resting on it with a force (to counteract gravity, so the object doesn't fall through the ramp) with is orthogonal to the ramp. When considering the combined force of it with gravity, the resulting net force will always pull the object downwards the ramp in our universe, but will pull it up the ramp in the Dichronauts universe when the slope is below diagonal. As a result, there is negative kinetic energy in the Dichronauts universe. Illustrations of this effect are shown on Greg Egan's website.[7]\n\nIn our universe with signature \n(\n−\n,\n+\n,\n+\n,\n+\n)\n, a planet with radius \n𝑟\n is described by the inequality \n𝑥\n2\n+\n𝑦\n2\n+\n𝑧\n2\n≤\n𝑟\n2\n of a sphere, which is convex, bounded and has a surface with one connected component. In the Dichronauts universe with signature \n(\n−\n,\n−\n,\n+\n,\n+\n)\n, a planet with radius \n𝑟\n is described by the inequality \n𝑥\n2\n+\n𝑦\n2\n−\n𝑧\n2\n≤\n𝑟\n2\n of a rotating hyperbola, which is concave, non-bounded and has a surface with three connected components. In both cases, the acceleration of gravity is orthogonal to the surface. But not only „orthogonal“ is different in both universes, gravity is as well. The Laplace operator is given by \nΔ\n=\n∂\n𝑥\n2\n+\n∂\n𝑦\n2\n+\n∂\n𝑧\n2\n in our universe and \nΔ\n=\n∂\n𝑥\n2\n+\n∂\n𝑦\n2\n−\n∂\n𝑧\n2\n in the Dichronauts universe, which changes the form of the gravitational field given by the Poisson equation (of which the Laplace equation is the special case of no matter). Illustrations of the gravitational field are shown on Greg Egan's website.[8]\n\nReception[edit]\n\nPublishers Weekly writes that the novel is „impressively bizarre“ and that „Egan may have out-Eganed himself with this one“.[9]\n\nKirkus Reviews writes, that „Egan specializes in inventing seriously strange worlds“ and „this one might well be his weirdest yet“, but „the problem is, it’s counterintuitive, so downright odd that it’s impossible to visualize the inhabitants, their surroundings, or what’s going on.“ The symbiosis has „plenty of other issues“ and the migration „is not even particularly original“, when compared to Inverted World by Christopher Priest.[9][10]\n\nReferenzen[edit]\n^ Greg Egan (2016-05-11). \"Dichronauts\".

It is located in the Senador Melo Viana district, in Sector 4. According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), its population in 2010 was 3,452 inhabitants (3.3% of the municipality's total), distributed over an area of 1.4 km2.[1][2]\n\nThe area, which belonged to the Archdiocese of Mariana until the late 1960s, was allotted and the neighborhood was officially created in 1971, under the mandate of Mayor Mariano Pires Pontes. It was named after Júlia Kubitschek, the mother of former president Juscelino Kubitschek, who had died that same year. Kubitschek attended the founding ceremony of the neighborhood, which initially had only a few houses. In the following decades, the population grew and the neighborhood acquired infrastructure and commerce.[3]\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nUntil the late 1960s, the area of the current neighborhood belonged to the Archdiocese of Mariana and was administered by Father Rocha, the local parish priest, as were the lands of the current neighborhoods of São Domingos, Recanto Verde and Bom Jesus. After he became ill, his properties were sold or given to other administrators. The land was bought by Fábio Xavier Pinheiro in 1970, who converted it into Bom Jesus Farm. Part of the area was allotted by Empreendimentos Novo Reno Ltda. in 1971, and the rest, in the rural perimeter, remained Fabio's property.[3]\n\nThe name of the neighborhood was suggested by the then federal deputy Aníbal Teixeira de Souza, a friend of Fábio's, to honor Professor Júlia Kubitschek, mother of former president Juscelino Kubitschek, who had died that same year. He attended the founding ceremony of the JK, the abbreviation by which the residential area is now known. The designation was formalized by Fabriciano's Executive and Legislative branches during the term of Mayor Mariano Pires Pontes. When Juscelino Kubitschek visited, the neighborhood had few streets and houses and no water supply or sewage collection. During heavy rains, there were floods in the lower part and major landslides in the upper part. In the 1980s, the area began to develop structurally and demographically.[3]\n\nOn October 1, 1982, the Zacarias Roque State School was founded, the first large school that had operated since 1964 in the Bom Jesus neighborhood and was transferred to a larger space in JK. Its name pays homage to José Zacarias da Silva Roque, the first notary of the Melo Viana district, which became the municipality of Coronel Fabriciano in 1948. In 1984, the Community Association of Residents of Bairro JK was created (now inactive) and in 1985, the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes was inaugurated. In the 1990s, there was an expansion of electricity supply services, sewage systems and bus routes.[3]\n\nGeography and demography[edit]\nCaladão Stream between the Melo Viana and Júlia Kubitschek neighborhoods.\n\nThe Júlia Kubitschek neighborhood has a total area of 1.4 km2 and is bordered by the districts of Melo Viana (to the north and east), Giovannini, Vila Bom Jesus (to the east), Bom Jesus and Nova Tijuca (to the south). It is bordered by the Caladão Stream, which cuts through the city and receives dirt and pollution from homes and small industries, workshops or slaughterhouses on its banks. Deforestation of the area began in 1970 when the land was cleared for allotment. When the residential nucleus was created in 1971, there were still a few houses and several undamaged places, but urbanization occurred during the 1970s and 1980s. The lack of vegetation on the hills led to frequent flooding during heavy rains, but structural improvements were made in the 1990s that reduced the damage caused by intense storms.[4][5][6][7]\n\nIn 2010, the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) estimated that 3 452 inhabitants lived in the neighborhood, which is comparable to cities in Minas Gerais such as São Félix de Minas, Fernandes Tourinho and Jaguaraçu. Among the 63 neighborhoods in Fabriciano, Júlia Kubitschek ranked eighth among the most populous, comprising 3.3% of the municipal population and 6.7% of the population of the Senador Melo Viana district, with a population density of 2,390.82 inhabitants per square kilometer. Of the total number of inhabitants, 1,662 were men (48.1% of the total) and 1,790 women (51.9%), distributed in 1,121 households. Part of JK is also included among the city's 20 informal settlements, with a total of 1,162 residents combined with the neighboring Melo Viana district. The Church of Our Lady of Lourdes is the seat of the Community of Our Lady of Lourdes, whose Catholic pastoral work is subordinate to the Parish of Saint Anthony, under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Itabira-Fabriciano.[8][9][10]\n\nInfrastructure and leisure[edit]\nEntrance of the Zacarias Roque State School.\n\nThe Zacarias Roque State School is located in the Júlia Kubitschek neighborhood and provides elementary education. It was created in the Bom Jesus neighborhood in 1964 and moved to JK in 1984. On June 9, 2014, the Sonho de Criança Municipal Early Childhood Education Center (CMEI) was inaugurated, serving children from six months to five years of age in preschool. There is also a basic care unit, which is run by the Municipal Health Department (SMS) and offers basic care and consultations to the population and nursing services, as well as serving as a vaccination post during vaccination campaigns.[11][12][13]\n\nThe water supply service is provided by Companhia de Saneamento de Minas Gerais (Copasa), while the electricity supply is the responsibility of Companhia Energética de Minas Gerais (Cemig), with 100% of the population having access to the electricity network. There are municipal public transport bus lines that serve the neighborhood directly or nearby areas that cross Júlia Kubitschek.[14][15]\n\nThe neighborhood's main attraction is the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes, inaugurated in 1985. Leisure activities for the population, often organized by the local Presbyterian Church and the Community of Our Lady of Lourdes, stand out. On October 12, children's toys and plays are prepared to commemorate Children's Day. The Zacarias Roque State School also organizes events aimed at the population, such as environmental awareness campaigns and educational talks. There are also June festivals, held by schools and churches, where square dancing is performed and typical food is sold and consumed, bringing together the population of JK and nearby neighborhoods.[16][17][18][19]\n\nGallery[edit]\nCananeia Avenue, where commerce is concentrated.\n \nView from Antônio Pinto Street.\n \nFacade of the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes.\n \nErosion on a hill in the JK neighborhood after heavy rains.\n \nView of the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes.\nSee also[edit]\nList of neighborhoods of Coronel Fabriciano\nHistory of Coronel Fabriciano\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"Tabela 202 - População residente por sexo e situação do domicílio\".
