The most common cause of death from cancer is complications from the cancer itself. This can include organ failure, severe bleeding, infection, or a weakened immune system. Cancer can also lead to death through secondary causes, such as malnutrition, dehydration, or other medical complications. In some cases, cancer can spread to other parts of the body, leading to a condition known as metastasis.

I am hoping to be in my physical prime in my golden years. If you eat healthy and exercise, is it possible to be in your physical prime in your 50's and 60's?,'\n',Nope, sorry. Aging brings about sacrcopenia, or muscle mass loss, no matter what you eat or how assiduously you exercise. Sarcopenia is inevitable, but if you work out HARDER than ever, you can still build muscle mass as you age. The older you get, the harder this becomes. Just maintaining your current workout will not stop sarcopenia; it will slow it down compared to not working out. There is no way to stop sarcopenia entirely.\n\nWe also lose collagen elasticity with aging; which helps explain wrinkles and a greater tendency for injury when working out. Tendons are mostly collagen; they rupture more easily as we age.\n\nThe bumps under the surface of our skin that keep the dermis attached to the epidermis, called dermal papillae, flatten out as we age, and the subcutaneous fat layer gets thinner. These explain why our skin tears more easily as we age. If you used sunscreen your whole life, this will be less of a problem, but it still happens. Some drugs make it worse. Once it begins, there’s not much you can do.\n\nThese examples are just a small set of the many inevitable changes that normally occur with aging. Just about every single physiologic process becomes less efficient and less effective. You can’t stop aging. All you can do is optimize your health at every age. Which stinks, yes, but it’s better than death (probably - we don’t really know.) Glad I could cheer you up!"}

At this level, we're diving into serious athlete territory, or those who are almost obsessive about their fitness regime.\n\nYou'll typically see this with bodybuilders preparing for a competition, or models gearing up for a big shoot. But let's delve into the specifics.\n\nMuscle Definition\n\nAt 8%, the body has just a minimal layer of fat covering it. You’ll see very defined muscles, with vascularity (visible veins) especially on the arms and shoulders. The abdominal muscles are usually distinct, with the coveted six-pack on display, provided there's enough muscle mass underneath.\n\nFacial Features\n\nThe face also becomes more angular, with cheekbones and jawline notably more defined. This is because there’s hardly any subcutaneous fat left padding the face.\n\nHealthy or Not?\n\nKeep in mind, while achieving such a low body fat percentage might look impressive, it’s not always synonymous with good health. Maintaining this level can be quite challenging and potentially unsustainable for long periods. Your body needs some fat reserve, after all.\n\nHow You Feel\n\nGetting down to 8% body fat often involves strict dieting and rigorous exercise. This can lead to increased fatigue, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. For most people, this level of body fat isn’t practical to maintain year-round.\n\nRemember, these are broad strokes. Genetics play a huge role in where and how we lose fat. Two people with 8% body fat can look very different based on muscle mass, where they tend to store fat, and their overall body composition.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nA word of caution for anyone aspiring to hit such low body fat percentages: please consult with a healthcare professional. Ensure your methods are healthy and sustainable.\n\nFor me, personally, I prefer a more balanced approach. Scott, residing in the vibrant city of Portland, OR, might hit the trails or indulge in the rich food scene. Moderation is key, and the goal should be overall health and wellness, rather than just aesthetics."}

The symptoms may change as the malignancy gets worse. Typical signs of carcinoma of the liver include:\n\nUnexplained weight loss: Liver cancer is one of the many cancers that can present with sudden and unexplained weight loss.\n\nAppetite reduction: Fatigue and weight loss may result from a decrease in appetite.\n\nAbdominal pain or discomfort: As the liver enlarges, there may be pain or discomfort in the upper right side of the abdomen. It may also radiate to the shoulder and back.\n\nSwelling or fluid buildup (ascites): Swelling and a fullness sensation can result from fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity.\n\nJaundice: The buildup of bilirubin causes yellowing of the skin and eyes, which is a typical indication of liver illnesses, including liver cancer.\n\nFatigue: Because liver cancer affects the body's energy reserves, it can cause persistent weakness and fatigue.\n\nVomiting and nausea: These symptoms could be brought on by the liver's inability to properly handle toxins.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that not everyone with one or more of these symptoms has liver cancer; in fact, similar symptoms might be brought on by a number of different illnesses.

A patient is thirsty and rather than giving them a refreshing glass of water, a nurse comes over with a cup of ice chips. What gives?\n\nWell, there's a method to the madness.\n\nFirstly, when certain patients are considered a high risk for aspiration, like after surgery or when they're very ill, giving them liquids can actually be dangerous. Aspiration is when something enters the airway or lungs by accident, which can lead to pneumonia or other complications. Not the kind of extra 'adventure' you want in a hospital.\n\nIce chips, on the other hand, melt slowly and in small amounts. So by sucking on ice chips, patients can stay hydrated without the risk of swallowing a large volume of liquid that could end up going down the wrong pipe. It's about controlling the intake.\n\nSecondly, in some cases, patients are required to have an empty stomach for certain procedures or tests. Ice chips can provide some hydration and mouth comfort without significantly adding to stomach contents. Also, if there's a chance of surgery, docs want that stomach as empty as possible, even when it comes to liquids.\n\nNow, let’s talk about the digestive system. After surgery or during certain illnesses, the digestive system can be a bit sluggish to wake up and start working properly again. Sipping on liquids might lead to nausea or vomiting, whereas ice chips melt and trickle down in such small amounts that it’s less likely to upset the stomach.\n\nAnd of course, there's the matter of ice chips being a soothing remedy for dry mouth, which is a common side effect of the supremely arid hospital air. It's also a bit of comfort care, honestly. There's something soothing about the coolness and the slight crunch that distracts from the less-than-pleasant aspects of a hospital stay.\n\nSo, in the ever-busy halls of hospitals where every action usually has a reason behind it, ice chips serve as a simple, yet smart solution for patient care.\n\nI mean, I'm sitting here in Portland, OR, wishing we could solve more of life's problems with something as straightforward as ice chips. Alas, most things aren’t as simple as soothing thirst with frozen water."}

Warm water is perfect for washing your face, it is much less aggressive for the skin barrier.\n\nBut having said that, I don't see the problem with washing your face in the shower.

It's a symbol of strength and a beacon of physical fitness. Lucky for us, you can make significant gains without ever leaving the comfort of your home.\n\nDumbbell Lateral Raises\nGrab a pair of dumbbells, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, and slightly bend your knees. Keep your core tight, raise the dumbbells to the side until they're parallel with the floor, then slowly lower them back down. This isolation exercise is fantastic for hitting the deltoids.\nPush-Ups\nNever underestimate the power of the push-up. It's a compound movement that not only targets your chest but also calls your shoulders and triceps into action. To focus more on the shoulders, try a pike push-up. With your hips in the air, it almost mimics the overhead press motion.\nHandstand Push-Ups\nNow, these are not for beginners, but they’re killer for developing shoulder strength and size. If you can manage a handstand against a wall, you can start by lowering your head toward the ground and pushing back up. Start with small movements and work up to full range as you grow stronger.\nDumbbell Shoulder Press\nSitting or standing, you just press the weights from shoulder height to above your head. It’s a bread-and-butter exercise that targets pretty much all the shoulder muscles.\nFront Raises\nAgain, dumbbells are your friend. Lift them straight in front of you to shoulder level, then back down, keeping your movements controlled. This hits the front part of the shoulders nicely.\nReverse Flyes\nBend over, whether you're standing or sitting, and with a straight back, lift the weights from your sides. Think of hugging a giant tree; that’s the motion. This exercise does wonders for the posterior deltoids, which are often neglected.\n\nAnd remember, Portland's weather can be a bit on the rainy side, so indoor workouts aren't just convenient, they’re often a necessity. Just like the evergreen wonders of the Oregon forests, aim to grow strong and wide. With these exercises and consistency, it's only a matter of time before your shoulders stand out, even in the thickest of flannel shirts.\n\nNow, go forth and build those boulder shoulders, Scott. And perhaps I'll catch you admiring the results as you stroll down the Willamette riverbank on a rare sunny day in beautiful PDX. Keep at it – consistency and proper form are your best friends in this journey."}

Sugars are the body's essential and favored wellspring of energy. At the point when you consume them, they're separated into glucose, which is utilized by cells to deliver energy. In any case, without a trace of dietary sugars, your body doesn't have this promptly accessible energy source. At first, the body takes advantage of its put away type of carbs called glycogen. These glycogen saves are commonly put away in the liver and muscles. As you go longer without consuming carbs, these glycogen stores are step by step drained. Presently, with restricted glucose accessible, the body needs another option.\n\nThis is where the course of ketosis becomes possibly the most important factor. Ketosis is a metabolic state where the body moves its essential fuel source from glucose to fats.

Often, there might be signs of kidney disease like protein in the urine or structural abnormalities but no noticeable symptoms.\nStage 2: Kidney damage is more significant than in Stage 1, but the GFR is still relatively high, ranging between 60-89 mL/min. Symptoms may not be evident at this stage, but there might be slight signs of kidney impairment.\nStage 3: Divided into two sub-stages:Stage 3A: GFR falls between 45-59 mL/min, indicating moderate kidney damage.Stage 3B: GFR further declines to 30-44 mL/min, indicating moderately severe kidney damage. Symptoms might start to appear, such as fatigue, swelling, changes in urination frequency, and possible signs of complications.\nStage 4: Severe kidney damage with a GFR range of 15-29 mL/min. Symptoms become more pronounced, including fluid retention, nausea, anemia, bone issues, and increased risk of cardiovascular problems.\nStage 5 (End-Stage Renal Disease - ESRD): This is the most severe stage where kidney function is significantly impaired, with a GFR of less than 15 mL/min. At this stage, kidneys can no longer function effectively to maintain life. Dialysis or a kidney transplant is usually necessary for survival.\n\nThese stages help healthcare professionals determine the severity of kidney disease and guide treatment and management strategies. Early detection and appropriate management can help slow down the progression of CKD and minimize complications. Regular monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and adhering to medical advice are crucial for individuals with kidney disease."}

{"date": "2023-12-27-22-34", "error": false, "url": "What are the potential negative effects of 5G technology on human health? What are the reported symptoms associated with these effects?", "text_blocks": "What are the potential negative effects of 5G technology on human health? What are the reported symptoms associated with these effects?,'\n',The deployment of 5G technology has raised concerns among some members of the public regarding potential health effects due to increased exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF). Before diving into the reported concerns, it's important to note that as of my last update, major health organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) and other research institutions have not confirmed consistent evidence that 5G technology poses significant health risks to humans when deployed within international safety guidelines.\n\nThe RF-EMF exposure from 5G technology is part of the non-ionizing part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which means it lacks sufficient energy to remove tightly bound electrons from atoms or molecules and hence cannot cause ionization in the human body. This is different from ionizing radiation (such as X-rays and gamma rays), which has been proven to pose a risk to human health, including DNA damage, at high exposure levels.\n\nHere are some of the concerns and reported symptoms that have been associated with RF-EMF exposure from wireless technologies, including 5G:\n\n1. **Cancer Risk**: Some studies have explored the possibility that RF-EMF exposure could be linked to an increased risk of certain types of cancer, but research has not provided conclusive results. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified RF-EMF as \"possibly carcinogenic to humans\" (Group 2B) based on an increased risk for glioma, a malignant type of brain cancer, associated with wireless phone use. However, this classification is not specific to 5G but to RF-EMF in general.\n\n2. **Thermal Effects**: RF-EMF can cause tissue heating, but 5G technology, when operating within safety guidelines, is designed to be below the levels that would cause such heating.\n\n3. **Non-thermal Effects**: There are claims about non-thermal effects such as headaches, sleep disturbances, fatigue, cognitive disruption, and other symptoms associated with electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS). However, scientific evidence has not consistently shown that these symptoms are caused by exposure to RF-EMF, and EHS is not recognized as a medical diagnosis by the majority of the medical community.\n\n4. **Effects on Skin and Eyes**: Some early studies suggested that millimeter waves (used in some 5G applications) could be absorbed by the skin and eyes more than lower-frequency waves, possibly leading to thermal injuries. But within the limits of international guidelines, the energy levels used for 5G should not be sufficient to cause such harm.\n\n5. **Impact on Wellbeing**: Some individuals report general wellbeing issues such as stress or anxiety, which they attribute to the presence of RF-EMF. This could be due to a nocebo effect, where the belief that something can cause harm leads to the manifestation of physical symptoms.\n\nIt is important to continue to monitor the scientific literature as more research is conducted, particularly long-term studies on the health effects of 5G technology. Regulatory bodies continue to review the evidence and update safety standards to ensure public health protection. If you have concerns about 5G and health, it's advisable to review the latest findings from reputable sources, such as the WHO or the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), which regularly assess the safety of RF-EMF exposures."}

Here are the biggest mistakes people are making, in my eyes:\n\n1. Not paying off credit card debt.\n\nDebt can make you feel hopeless—even if you’re responsible about making payments on time, the interest sometimes prevents you from paying off the debt.\n\nBut, believe it or not, plenty of companies (National Debt Relief\n, for example) are willing to help you pay off your debt.\n\nHere’s how it typically works:\n\nYou typically need $10k+ in overall debt (credit cards, medical debt, etc. combined).\nA company like National Debt Relief\n (there are plenty of others, too) negotiates with your credit card companies, banks etc. to try and reduce your debt.\nIf possible, they’ll consolidate all of your different sources of debt so you only have to make one monthly payment to one place.\n\nA lot of times you’ll end up paying significantly less than you owe. Here’s an example from NDR’s site:\n\nE.g. he was $36k in debt, but only ended up paying $23kish.\n\nIf things go well, you could be debt-free in 24-48 months or so. Here’s a calculator you can use to get a savings estimate\n, if you’re interested.\n\n2. Not getting a financial advisor.\n\n99% of people don’t have one, and it’s typically a huge mistake.\n\nSure, you can manage things on your own if you want to, but most people don’t have the time to actually do things right. There are huge benefits to having somebody pay attention to your money all the time.\n\nPeople with financial advisors tend to beat the market by ~3%/year (according to a 2019 Vanguard Study). That can make a huge difference over time.\nBut more important: a good advisor will handle ALL of the annoying retirement stuff & bizarro tax implications you would have never thought of\n\nIf you don’t know a financial advisor personally, use a comparison site (like WiserAdvisor\n) and find somebody near you that has good reviews.\n\nOr if you want something easier, here’s a quiz you can fill out that will find an advisor/planner based on your reqs.\n\n3. Not using an ad blocker.\n\nIf you aren’t using an ad blocker yet, I am begging you to try one. I am not exaggerating when I say it will change your life.\n\nA good ad blocker will eliminate virtually all of the ads you’d see on the internet.\n\nNo more YouTube ads, no more banner ads, no more pop-up ads, etc. It’s incredible.\n\nMost people I know use Total Adblock (link here\n) – it’s $2.42/month, but there are plenty of solid options.\n\nAds also typically take a while to load, so using an ad blocker reduces loading times (typically by 50% or more). They also block ad tracking pixels to protect your privacy, which is nice.\n\nHere’s a link to Total Adblock\n, if you’re interested.\n\n4. Overpaying on car insurance by $400+/year.\n\nThe average American family still overspends by up to $417/year on car insurance.\n\nCheck out a site like Coverage.com\n to compare the best car insurance options available.\n\nAnswer a few questions and get matched with a customized offer today.\n\nSee how much you could save.\n\n5. Getting price gouged on the internet.\n\nYou’d be shocked to know how often you’re overpaying on Amazon and elsewhere.\n\nBig stores like Amazon know that no one has time to price shop through dozens of sites, so there’s often no incentive for them to offer bargain prices.\n\nIf you don’t have the Capital One Shopping app\n installed yet, do yourself a favor and get it\n.\n\nWhen you shop online (on Amazon or elsewhere) it will:\n\nAuto-apply coupon savings codes.\nCompare prices from other sellers to make sure you’re not missing out on a better deal.\n\nThis app has saved me a decent amount of money more than once. Here’s a link to download it\n, if you want.\n\n6. Not getting paid for your opinions.\n\nAs a general rule I would ignore any site that says they'll pay you to fill out surveys, but there are a few that are legitimate (and pay pretty well).\n\nI usually use Branded Surveys (link here\n). You basically just get paid to give your opinions on different products/services, etc. Perfect for when you're watching TV.\n\nHere's the form I used to sign up\n - I think it took me maybe 1-2 minutes tops.\n\n7. Not investing in real estate (start with as little as $20).\n\nIt’s no secret that millionaires and billionaires love investing in real estate, but for the rest of us, buying property has been prohibitively expensive (if not impossible, for some).\n\nTimes have changed. There are a few amazing real estate startups that allow you to buy shares of rental homes for as little as $20/share (Ark7\n is one of our favorites).\n\nThey take care of the property management and collect rent checks for you. Then, on the 3rd of the following month, your share of the property’s profit is distributed to your account.\n\nIt’s an interesting way to build yourself a little rental home empire (without spending like a magnate).\n\nIf you’re interested, take a look at Ark7’s properties here.\n\n8. Not getting paid for your screentime.\n\nThere are a bunch of apps that will pay you to test out new games & apps and provide your feedback (sometimes physical products too).\n\nI typically use TesterUp\n, but there are others too. It's free: you just sign up and pick which tests look fun/interesting to you. I’ve seen tests pay as much as $160, which can add up pretty quickly.\n\nHere’s a link to the app.\n\nHope that helps someone!"}

However, there may be signs of mild kidney damage, such as a slight decrease in kidney function or the presence of protein or blood in the urine.\n\nStage 1 CKD typically doesn't cause noticeable symptoms, and many people may not even be aware they have it without undergoing specific tests to check kidney function. It's crucial to detect kidney issues at this early stage because managing underlying conditions, such as high blood pressure or diabetes, and making lifestyle changes can potentially slow down the progression of kidney disease and prevent further damage.

Regular physical activity, including walking, has been shown to have positive effects on both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.\n\nEngaging in aerobic exercises like walking can contribute to the following benefits:\n\nImproved cardiovascular health: Walking increases heart rate, strengthens the heart muscle, and enhances blood flow. Over time, this can lead to improved cardiovascular health and lower blood pressure.\nWeight management: Regular walking can help with weight loss or weight maintenance, which is often recommended for individuals with hypertension. Losing excess weight or maintaining a healthy weight can contribute to lower blood pressure levels.\nStress reduction: Walking is a form of physical activity that can help reduce stress and promote relaxation. Lowering stress levels can have a positive impact on blood pressure.\nImproved blood vessel function: Regular exercise, including walking, can enhance the flexibility and function of blood vessels, promoting healthier blood pressure levels.\n\nWhen it comes to walking for blood pressure management, consistency is key. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, per week. You can break this down into shorter sessions of 30 minutes each, five days a week. However, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting or modifying any exercise program, especially if you have hypertension or other underlying health conditions.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that while walking can be beneficial for many individuals with hypertension, it may not be sufficient as the sole treatment for those with severe hypertension or certain medical conditions. In such cases, your healthcare professional may recommend a combination of lifestyle modifications and medications to manage your blood pressure effectively."}

Those muscles you've been targeting? They're going through a repair and rebuild phase which ultimately makes them stronger.\n\nThat pain you feel the next day? That's the body's way of saying, \"Hey, we've got some reconstruction work going on here.\" This process is essential because that's how you get gains in muscle size and strength.\n\nI live in Portland, OR, and around these parts, we're big on hitting the trails and staying fit. Whether it's the gym or the great outdoors, we've all felt that sweetness of soreness that comes after pushing our limits.\n\nNow, make sure you're performing your exercises with proper form. Incorrect form may not only lead to an intensity of soreness but could also cause actual injuries. You might not feel it right away during the workout, but the next day, oh boy, your body will send you a not-so-friendly reminder.\n\nMake sure you're warming up adequately before your workouts and cooling down after. Incorporating dynamic stretches and gradually increasing your workload allows those muscles to get ready for the battle and properly wind down afterward.\n\nIn between workouts, don't neglect proper nutrition and hydration – these are your allies in the fight against DOMS. Sufficient protein helps in muscle repair, and staying hydrated means your body's repair processes are working optimally.\n\nAnd a pro tip: consider adding some active recovery into your routine. Think a light jog, cycling, or maybe some yoga. Here in Portland, we've got plenty of options for active recovery, and that increased blood flow to your sore muscles will help speed up the healing process.\n\nSo, embrace the soreness to a degree. It's a sign you're working hard and your muscles are responding. But remember, pain that doesn't feel \"right\" or is excessively sharp should not be ignored—listen to your body, and if in doubt, consult with a fitness professional or a healthcare provider. Stay safe and keep crushing those workouts!"}

It's more prone to breaking down because it's closely connected to the liver and is involved in the body's metabolic processes.\nHealth Impact: Visceral fat is associated with higher health risks such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Therefore, as you start losing weight, the body may prioritize burning visceral fat to improve overall health.\nExercise and Diet Influence: High-intensity exercise and dietary changes can have a more pronounced effect on reducing visceral fat. Aerobic exercises and a healthy diet can specifically target visceral fat more effectively than subcutaneous fat.\nInsulin Sensitivity: Visceral fat can affect insulin sensitivity more directly than subcutaneous fat. As insulin sensitivity improves, it can lead to more effective burning of visceral fat.\nIndividual Variations: The rate and pattern of fat loss can vary significantly among individuals. Factors like genetics, hormonal balance, age, and gender can influence how fat is distributed and lost from different areas of the body.\n\nWhile visceral fat might respond more quickly to lifestyle changes, reducing subcutaneous fat also contributes to overall weight loss and improvements in body composition. Losing fat in a healthy and sustainable manner involves a balanced diet, regular exercise, and lifestyle modifications rather than focusing solely on losing fat from specific areas."}

Scientists are still studying the mystery of sleep and trying to understand why we do it and what purpose it serves.\n\nThe amount of sleep that an individual needs depends on many factors, such as age, activity level, health status, stress levels and environmental conditions. Most adults need between 7-9 hours per night in order to function optimally. However, some people may be able to do well with less or more than the recommended amount.\n\nThere are several theories about why we sleep. One theory suggests that sleep is important for consolidation of new memories and learning. During sleep, your brain processes information from that day, forming new neural connections and strengthening existing ones. This helps you remember what you learned during the day and may even aid in problem solving skills by allowing connections to establish in your brain while sleeping.\n\nIn addition, sleep helps repair any damage done to your body during the day by providing time for cells to regenerate and heal themselves. The hormones released during sleep play an important role in helping control growth rate as well as inflammation throughout the body which helps keep you healthy overall.\n\nScientists believe that sleep is necessary for certain metabolic functions such as appetite regulation or glucose metabolism in order to maintain homeostasis within the body’s systems. Sleep deficiency has been linked with an increased risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes or heart disease along with obesity due to its effect on metabolism.\n\nWe still don't fully understand why we need sleep but research continues in this field every day in order to unravel the mysteries behind it's necessity for both physical and mental health purposes.

However, here are some signs to watch out for:\n\nEarly signs:\n\nHigh blood pressure: This is a major risk factor for kidney disease and often worsens with kidney damage.\nMicroalbuminuria: This is the presence of a small amount of protein, called albumin, in the urine. It's an early indicator of kidney damage, even before symptoms appear.\nChanges in urination: This can include increased frequency, especially at night, decreased urine output, or foamy urine.\n\nLater signs:\n\nFluid retention: This can manifest as swelling in the ankles, feet, legs, hands, or face.\nFatigue and weakness: This can be caused by anemia, a common complication of kidney failure.\nLoss of appetite and nausea: These can be caused by waste products building up in the blood as the kidneys lose their filtering ability.\nItching: This can be due to the buildup of toxins in the skin.\nConfusion and difficulty thinking: This can occur due to waste products affecting the brain.\nShortness of breath: This can be caused by fluid buildup in the lungs.\n\nAdditionally, for people with diabetes, these changes might need closer attention:\n\nReduced need for insulin: As kidneys decline in function, they remove less insulin from the blood, potentially leading to lower insulin requirements.\nUnexplained weight loss: This can be a symptom of malnutrition or protein loss due to kidney damage.\n\nRemember:\n\nEarly detection is crucial. Regular checkups with your doctor, including blood and urine tests, are essential for monitoring kidney function in individuals with diabetes.\nSymptoms can be vague and overlap with other conditions. If you experience any of these signs, seek medical advice promptly.\nEarly intervention with proper treatment can help slow the progression of kidney disease and improve your quality of life."}

I would recommend washing your armpits, groin and feet every morning and night with water (and soap if you want) since those areas sweat often. Occasionally you can put on deodrant but make sure to wipe the sweat off with a wipe before doing so, applying deodrant daily isnt neccesary only apply it if you know your going to excersize or do lots of activity. Also carry around wipes in a small pouch so if you feel yourself stinking in a public place, you can go to the bathroom and wipe your armpits.\n\nhope this helps 😊"}
