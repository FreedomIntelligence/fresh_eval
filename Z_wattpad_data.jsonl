Indulging her, I tell her as much as I can remember until we reach the front of the queue and receive our lunch for the day: undercooked chicken with some kind of vegetables.\"Ooh look, Ruby and Katherine are over there!\" Charlotte nudges me excitedly, after scanning the crowded dining hall and spotting our two friends at a small table.  \"Should we go sit with them?\"\"Yeah sure,\" I shrug nonchalantly and we both make our way over.  As we near their table, we can start to hear some of their conversation even through the chaotic noises in the dining hall. \"Oh my gosh, that's so exciting!\" Katherine gushes to Ruby just as Charlotte and I put our trays down and sit next to our friends at the table.\"What's exciting?\" I ask as I glance back and forth between them, not happy to be left out of the loop.Ruby glances down sheepishly, while Katherine is more than glad to share the discussion with the newcomers. \"Ruby's date with Zac, obviously!\" she exclaims, her eyes sparkling like stars at the fairytale-like romance she has no doubt already imagined in her mind.Charlotte gasps in excitement while my heart feels like someone's put a heavy weight on it, though I try to appear as enthusiastic as her. \"For the last time, Katherine, it's not a date!\" Ruby chastises, her voice muffled, with her head in her hands to hide the blush blossoming across her cheeks.\"Um, you sure about that, girl?\" Katherine crosses her arms, a sure sign that she's about to go into analysis mode.  \"First of all, he asked you to go to town with him, and even if he didn't specify it's a date, it's pretty much implied.  Second of all, when a boy and a girl hang out together — alone, might I add — it's pretty clear to me that it's a date.  And third of all, when said boy and girl have already kissed once before and are now texting each other all the time, surely you see what this means?\"\"This is all just speculation,\" Ruby counters.  \"He might just want someone to hang out with.  We're just two friends meeting up for not-a-date.\"\"Riiiight,\" Katherine nods her head slowly, not believing her words.  \"Come on, Ruby, have some confidence in yourself!  It's obvious he likes you.\"Ruby raises her head at this.  \"You really think so?\"\"Yeah, of course!\" Charlotte chimes in.  \"You're a smart beautiful girl, and he'd be lucky to have you.\"Fiddling with her nails, Ruby turns to me and asks, \"What do you think, Isla?\"Suddenly nervous, I glance around the table, wondering if anyone will come to my rescue at such a targeted question, but Charlotte merely keeps her gaze down while Katherine raises an eyebrow at me as if to say \"your call\".I bite my lip, thinking hard.  Obviously I don't want her to date Zac, especially when they haven't even known each other for a week.  But who am I to stop Ruby from pursuing what I can see she wants?  \"Go for it, Ruby,\" I encourage her.  \"I can tell he likes you as much as you like him.\"There's a look in Ruby's eyes that I can't decode.  If I don't know better, I might actually think that it's disappointment.  But it can't be.  I know for a fact that Ruby's been gushing over Zac ever since they met.  Perhaps she just doesn't think I'm sincere in my encouragement?\"You really think so?\" Ruby enquires once again, unknowingly rubbing salt in the wound.I look her in the eye, put on the sincerest expression I can muster, and say, \"Yes, I really think so.  Stop worrying so much.\"She gave me a small smile, a sign that she believes me.  \"Okay,\" she replies timidly, and that is the end of it.  After that, we return to more mundane topics as we steer the conversation back into calmer waters. ***\"That's it for today, class,\" Miss Jackson announces just in time for the bell signalling the end of the school day to ring.  \"Can you all please read up to chapter 33 of the novel for next week?\"I sigh in exhaustion as I dump my copy of Pride and Prejudice into my bag, glad the lesson is finally over.  English is no easy subject, especially with all the reading between the lines and vague interpretations, which is definitely not one of my strong suits.I return to my own form room and perch on one of the desks, waiting for Ruby, like I do every single week.  As I wait, I decide to take out my book to get started on the English reading homework.  I'm only 2 pages in before I hear a pair of footsteps entering the room. \"Hey, Ruby,\" I greet her as I raise my head from the novel.\"Hi, Isla,\" she says but doesn't sit.  \"I know we made plans to hang out every Thursday after school, but I gotta go to town now.  I'm sorry.\"\"Oh,\" I say, the disappointment clear in my tone.  But then I remember, and I try to act less upset and more excited.  \"It's your date with Zac, right?\"\"Yeah, and once again, not a date,\" Ruby replies.  \"We're meeting at 3:45, and it takes at least 10 minutes to walk to town, and that's if I walk fast.  I should probably be going now.\"  She hovers at the door, and it dawns on me that she's implicitly apologising for not hanging out with me today, even though we made plans.\"Yeah, no problem,\" I shrug, disguising my dismay under a layer of nonchalance.  \"You better walk fast then.  Don't wanna be late.\"\"Right,\" Ruby nods.  \"Bye then, see you tomorrow.\"She leaves, and once again I feel a sort of emptiness in my heart, but I dismiss the feeling, knowing that nothing good will come out of descending down the rabbit hole of misery.Letting out a sigh, I collect my belongings and head over to the music department, deciding that some time alone on the harp can get my mind off things and is also a relaxing pastime.However, as soon as I enter the music building, I come face to face with Elena.\"You again?\" I exclaim, exasperated.  \"Do you really have nothing better to do with your time than pissing me off?\"\"Not everything revolves around you, Isla,\" Elena teases, her tone still playful while mine is annoyed.  \"I actually came here to practise, believe it or not.\"I look at her dubiously.  \"Right.  You play an instrument?\"\"Mhm,\" Elena nods, \"I play the cello.\"I must admit, I am shocked by this revelation.  I never thought that Elena of all people would be good at music or anything remotely academic.  I always assumed that since she's the queen bee, she's different from the rest of us commoners.  But I guess I was being unfair and prejudiced.\"Huh,\" I say lamely, still too surprised to make a proper response.  \"Well, have fun practising then.\"  With that, I start to make my way up the stairs, on a mission to find an empty practice room with a harp for me to play.***\"Isla!\" Nisha shakes my shoulder, startling me out of my stupor. \"Isla, you're lucky Miss Forrester hasn't noticed you zoning out all lesson,\" she whispers.  \"Come on, we're meant to be doing this worksheet here.\"\"Oh right, sorry, just tired,\" I mumble before I refocus my gaze on the questions on the sheet. It's the second-to-last lesson on a Friday afternoon, and nothing can make the students more excited and restless than the prospect of a relaxing weekend ahead of us.  Which is why almost no one is listening in class anymore, with most of them having long since given up on understanding the concept of electrolysis. Skimming through the class notes, I try to absorb the information as quickly as possible before embarking on the questions with Nisha.  Before long, the bell rings just as we complete the final question on the sheet.I let out a sigh of exhaustion as I pack my things away and head over to the art department for my last lesson of the week.\"Okay, everyone, settle down,\" Mr Li hollers when the majority of the class has arrived.  \"Today, you'll just be working on your projects and organising your sketchbook.\"Okay, easy enough, I think to myself as I get started on my individual work without any distractions. Just before I come face to face with the biggest distraction I can possibly have at the moment. Elena and her two sidekicks, Sabrina and Yvonne.  Out to make my life hell. \"Hey, Isla,\" Sabrina drawls as she makes her way over to my desk. I ignore her and keep my eyes trained on my sketchbook.  It's taking every ounce of my self-control not to snap back at her. \"What's wrong, darling?\" Yvonne follows her, refusing to miss out on the fun.  \"Aren't we all friends here?  It's not nice to ignore your friends.\"\"Not to be rude, but would you kindly piss off?\" I growl at them both.  \"I've got work to do.\"Yvonne looks like she wants to give me a piece of her mind, a mock offended expression on her face, but before she can, their ringleader calls them back. \"Come on, girls,\" Elena exclaims all the way on the other side of the room by the paint station.  \"Let's leave Isla to her work.  Besides, we've got things to do ourselves.\"  After hearing that, Sabrina and Yvonne leave me to my own devices, ever the obedient sidekicks, but not before sneering and glaring at me.I stare at Elena, confused.  I thought for sure that she'd utilise this opportunity to tease me relentlessly.  Did she get bored of me that quickly?  Why am I even caring so much?  Shouldn't I be glad that she's not singling me out anymore?  Or is it just because she wants to be in charge of things herself and doesn't want it to be initiated by Sabrina and Yvonne. Elena Quinn really confuses me a lot. But seriously, why do I even care?A week ago, Elena was merely a stranger to me.  Granted, she wasn't just a normal face in the crowd; I knew her as the perfect queen bee.  But why have I been affected so much in just five days?Why can't I get her out of my head?"}

He and I are just going out to meet some of his friends \"His mouth was shut when the same glares were thrown at him by all of them as he murmured \"Lagta hai ab toh gaye \" and by now all others were present in the hall seeing the ladies in their extreme anger.The ladies just said \"MEN ☕\" and moved away while the men passed confused looks to each other. The ladies understood their confusion and said in unison\" Aap mardon mein see koi bhi do din take ghar ke bahar nahi jayenge \"All the men looked at them with horror and wished that they were just joking and teasing them but the look on their faces already told them that it was serious but the question was 'Why?'.The ladies who were giggling looking at their condition laughed out loud when Avanti said \" Waise bhi jija ji ladke to kahi jate hi kahan hai to kya farak padta hai agar aap do din ghar mein rahenge\" She said in her sarcastic tone.Now all the other men were looking at 'Mr. Vineet Shekhawat ' for his explanation for this blunder and her Vineet realised what he did. He looked at all of them and just said\" Kya meri taraf kyun dekh rahe ho sab meri koi galti nahi hai vo bas galti see bol diya that inhone serious le liya usmein mein kya karun\"All of them now took his side not wanting to let the ladies win and said supporting him\" aur nahi toh kya bacha sahi hi to keh raha hai kya galat hai ismein hum mard kaam ke alava bahar jate hi kahan hai \" his grandfather said taking his grandson's side.Suddenly Vaishali Shekhawat snapped back at him saying \" Ohho hoo aap to budhe ho chale hain lekin hai to mard hi kaise apni galti manenge, chaliye zara andar aapko bata te hain hum \" she said the last part that was only audible to him.Now all of them were sitting for dinner when in between Vineet got a call from his friends he just picked up and said \" haan bhai vo kuch kaam hai to nahi aa paunga \" and cut the call without waiting for the response.When he was about to put a morsel of food again his phone rang and the person on the line told him to come or meet them after years. He murmured a sorry to the person and began eating his food.Everyone had moved to their room when Vineet entered the room he found that Yashashvini was taking her blanket and pillow and was coming towards the door, she whispered to him \"Good night\"When she was about to move out of the room her wrist was caught by him and he pulled her towards himself making their front bodies collide with each other. He tucked the hair strands falling on her face and asked her in his husky voice \" Where are you going biwi ?\" She removed his hand which was now travelling to her waist and opened the door.She said \" MR. let me remind you mein aapse naraz hun nahi nahi aap jaiye bahar ab dekhna kaise aap ghar mein rukoge aur mein bahar ghumti rahungi \" She showed her tongue to him and went away.Vineet said \" thik hai biwi ab aapko do din ghar mein rehke dikhayenge aur haan jahan aapke Mr. rahenge wahin pe aap rahengi to hume chodkar aap ko kahin nahi jane denge hum \" he said with a smirk plastered on his face.They all fell asleep while pondering about the challenge.-------------Yashashvini's POVIt was morning and we all decided to go for shopping while leaving our husbands at home only Aditya was allowed. I moved towards Avanti's room to wake her up and begin our evil plan.I removed the curtain and that idiot pulled over her blanket and whispered in her sleep \" Yarrr Yaashu kya hai tujhe sone de na\" and with that I moved towards her bed.\" Madam ji uth jao plan bhi execute karna hai breakfast karne aa ja taiyar hoke phir Aditya ke sath nikal jayenge \" and I don't know why this sentence made her sit straight with her eyes wide open.\"Vo.. Vo... Bandar...  I mean Aditya vo kyun chal raha hai plan to sab ladko ko ghar pe chhor ke jane ka tha na.. vo bhi to ladka hai \" I was just saying \" Nahi...\" when she cut me saying \" Kya matlab vo ladka nahi hai\" with horror in her eyes.I face-palmed myself and explained to her that he was not at fault so this punishment was only for the married men. She just rolled her eyes and went to the bathroom while I moved outside for breakfast.We were sitting at the table when Avanti came and sat between me and Aditya as that was the only seat left.While Papa asked \" Adi beta teri maa , meri maa aur meri bahu humein to leke ja nahi rahi to tu inke shopping bags utha to lega na \" Aditya responded \" Haan papa mein utha lunga aur aap dusri bahu lao to sahi mein toh uske nakhre bhi utha lunga \"he said the last part in a low tone which was only audible to me and Avanti and suddenly he winked at Avanti.I choked my food in shock while Vineet rubbed my back and Aditya passed me the water. I need to talk to him. Does he really like Avanti?-------------Uff another chapter and we have achieved another big milestone of 11K Thank you so much I hope we achieve more and do you like the flirty Aditya with Avanti?

while mine is annoyed.  \"I actually came here to practise, believe it or not.\"I look at her dubiously.  \"Right.  You play an instrument?\"\"Mhm,\" Elena nods, \"I play the cello.\"I must admit, I am shocked by this revelation.  I never thought that Elena of all people would be good at music or anything remotely academic.  I always assumed that since she's the queen bee, she's different from the rest of us commoners.  But I guess I was being unfair and prejudiced.\"Huh,\" I say lamely, still too surprised to make a proper response.  \"Well, have fun practising then.\"  With that, I start to make my way up the stairs, on a mission to find an empty practice room with a harp for me to play.***\"Isla!\" Nisha shakes my shoulder, startling me out of my stupor. \"Isla, you're lucky Miss Forrester hasn't noticed you zoning out all lesson,\" she whispers.  \"Come on, we're meant to be doing this worksheet here.\"\"Oh right, sorry, just tired,\" I mumble before I refocus my gaze on the questions on the sheet. It's the second-to-last lesson on a Friday afternoon, and nothing can make the students more excited and restless than the prospect of a relaxing weekend ahead of us.  Which is why almost no one is listening in class anymore, with most of them having long since given up on understanding the concept of electrolysis. Skimming through the class notes, I try to absorb the information as quickly as possible before embarking on the questions with Nisha.  Before long, the bell rings just as we complete the final question on the sheet.I let out a sigh of exhaustion as I pack my things away and head over to the art department for my last lesson of the week.\"Okay, everyone, settle down,\" Mr Li hollers when the majority of the class has arrived.  \"Today, you'll just be working on your projects and organising your sketchbook.\"Okay, easy enough, I think to myself as I get started on my individual work without any distractions. Just before I come face to face with the biggest distraction I can possibly have at the moment. Elena and her two sidekicks, Sabrina and Yvonne.  Out to make my life hell. \"Hey, Isla,\" Sabrina drawls as she makes her way over to my desk. I ignore her and keep my eyes trained on my sketchbook.  It's taking every ounce of my self-control not to snap back at her. \"What's wrong, darling?\" Yvonne follows her, refusing to miss out on the fun.  \"Aren't we all friends here?  It's not nice to ignore your friends.\"\"Not to be rude, but would you kindly piss off?\" I growl at them both.  \"I've got work to do.\"Yvonne looks like she wants to give me a piece of her mind, a mock offended expression on her face, but before she can, their ringleader calls them back. \"Come on, girls,\" Elena exclaims all the way on the other side of the room by the paint station.  \"Let's leave Isla to her work.  Besides, we've got things to do ourselves.\"  After hearing that, Sabrina and Yvonne leave me to my own devices, ever the obedient sidekicks, but not before sneering and glaring at me.I stare at Elena, confused.  I thought for sure that she'd utilise this opportunity to tease me relentlessly.  Did she get bored of me that quickly?  Why am I even caring so much?  Shouldn't I be glad that she's not singling me out anymore?  Or is it just because she wants to be in charge of things herself and doesn't want it to be initiated by Sabrina and Yvonne. Elena Quinn really confuses me a lot. But seriously, why do I even care?A week ago, Elena was merely a stranger to me.  Granted, she wasn't just a normal face in the crowd; I knew her as the perfect queen bee.  But why have I been affected so much in just five days?Why can't I get her out of my head?"}

The ladies understood their confusion and said in unison\" Aap mardon mein see koi bhi do din take ghar ke bahar nahi jayenge \"All the men looked at them with horror and wished that they were just joking and teasing them but the look on their faces already told them that it was serious but the question was 'Why?'.The ladies who were giggling looking at their condition laughed out loud when Avanti said \" Waise bhi jija ji ladke to kahi jate hi kahan hai to kya farak padta hai agar aap do din ghar mein rahenge\" She said in her sarcastic tone.Now all the other men were looking at 'Mr. Vineet Shekhawat ' for his explanation for this blunder and her Vineet realised what he did. He looked at all of them and just said\" Kya meri taraf kyun dekh rahe ho sab meri koi galti nahi hai vo bas galti see bol diya that inhone serious le liya usmein mein kya karun\"All of them now took his side not wanting to let the ladies win and said supporting him\" aur nahi toh kya bacha sahi hi to keh raha hai kya galat hai ismein hum mard kaam ke alava bahar jate hi kahan hai \" his grandfather said taking his grandson's side.Suddenly Vaishali Shekhawat snapped back at him saying \" Ohho hoo aap to budhe ho chale hain lekin hai to mard hi kaise apni galti manenge, chaliye zara andar aapko bata te hain hum \" she said the last part that was only audible to him.Now all of them were sitting for dinner when in between Vineet got a call from his friends he just picked up and said \" haan bhai vo kuch kaam hai to nahi aa paunga \" and cut the call without waiting for the response.When he was about to put a morsel of food again his phone rang and the person on the line told him to come or meet them after years.

Vo... Bandar...  I mean Aditya vo kyun chal raha hai plan to sab ladko ko ghar pe chhor ke jane ka tha na.. vo bhi to ladka hai \" I was just saying \" Nahi...\" when she cut me saying \" Kya matlab vo ladka nahi hai\" with horror in her eyes.I face-palmed myself and explained to her that he was not at fault so this punishment was only for the married men. She just rolled her eyes and went to the bathroom while I moved outside for breakfast.We were sitting at the table when Avanti came and sat between me and Aditya as that was the only seat left.While Papa asked \" Adi beta teri maa , meri maa aur meri bahu humein to leke ja nahi rahi to tu inke shopping bags utha to lega na \" Aditya responded \" Haan papa mein utha lunga aur aap dusri bahu lao to sahi mein toh uske nakhre bhi utha lunga \"he said the last part in a low tone which was only audible to me and Avanti and suddenly he winked at Avanti.I choked my food in shock while Vineet rubbed my back and Aditya passed me the water. I need to talk to him.

Indulging her, I tell her as much as I can remember until we reach the front of the queue and receive our lunch for the day: undercooked chicken with some kind of vegetables.\"Ooh look, Ruby and Katherine are over there!\" Charlotte nudges me excitedly, after scanning the crowded dining hall and spotting our two friends at a small table.  \"Should we go sit with them?\"\"Yeah sure,\" I shrug nonchalantly and we both make our way over.  As we near their table, we can start to hear some of their conversation even through the chaotic noises in the dining hall. \"Oh my gosh, that's so exciting!\" Katherine gushes to Ruby just as Charlotte and I put our trays down and sit next to our friends at the table.\"What's exciting?\" I ask as I glance back and forth between them, not happy to be left out of the loop.Ruby glances down sheepishly, while Katherine is more than glad to share the discussion with the newcomers. \"Ruby's date with Zac, obviously!\" she exclaims, her eyes sparkling like stars at the fairytale-like romance she has no doubt already imagined in her mind.Charlotte gasps in excitement while my heart feels like someone's put a heavy weight on it, though I try to appear as enthusiastic as her. \"For the last time, Katherine, it's not a date!\" Ruby chastises, her voice muffled, with her head in her hands to hide the blush blossoming across her cheeks.\"Um, you sure about that, girl?\" Katherine crosses her arms, a sure sign that she's about to go into analysis mode.  \"First of all, he asked you to go to town with him, and even if he didn't specify it's a date, it's pretty much implied.  Second of all, when a boy and a girl hang out together — alone, might I add — it's pretty clear to me that it's a date.  And third of all, when said boy and girl have already kissed once before and are now texting each other all the time, surely you see what this means?\"\"This is all just speculation,\" Ruby counters.  \"He might just want someone to hang out with.  We're just two friends meeting up for not-a-date.\"\"Riiiight,\" Katherine nods her head slowly, not believing her words.  \"Come on, Ruby, have some confidence in yourself!  It's obvious he likes you.\"Ruby raises her head at this.  \"You really think so?\"\"Yeah, of course!\" Charlotte chimes in.  \"You're a smart beautiful girl, and he'd be lucky to have you.\"Fiddling with her nails, Ruby turns to me and asks, \"What do you think, Isla?\"Suddenly nervous, I glance around the table, wondering if anyone will come to my rescue at such a targeted question, but Charlotte merely keeps her gaze down while Katherine raises an eyebrow at me as if to say \"your call\".I bite my lip, thinking hard.  Obviously I don't want her to date Zac, especially when they haven't even known each other for a week.  But who am I to stop Ruby from pursuing what I can see she wants?  \"Go for it, Ruby,\" I encourage her.  \"I can tell he likes you as much as you like him.\"There's a look in Ruby's eyes that I can't decode.  If I don't know better, I might actually think that it's disappointment.  But it can't be.  I know for a fact that Ruby's been gushing over Zac ever since they met.  Perhaps she just doesn't think I'm sincere in my encouragement?\"You really think so?\" Ruby enquires once again, unknowingly rubbing salt in the wound.I look her in the eye, put on the sincerest expression I can muster, and say, \"Yes, I really think so.  Stop worrying so much.\"She gave me a small smile, a sign that she believes me.  \"Okay,\" she replies timidly, and that is the end of it.  After that, we return to more mundane topics as we steer the conversation back into calmer waters. ***\"That's it for today, class,\" Miss Jackson announces just in time for the bell signalling the end of the school day to ring.  \"Can you all please read up to chapter 33 of the novel for next week?\"I sigh in exhaustion as I dump my copy of Pride and Prejudice into my bag, glad the lesson is finally over.  English is no easy subject, especially with all the reading between the lines and vague interpretations, which is definitely not one of my strong suits.I return to my own form room and perch on one of the desks, waiting for Ruby, like I do every single week.  As I wait, I decide to take out my book to get started on the English reading homework.  I'm only 2 pages in before I hear a pair of footsteps entering the room. \"Hey, Ruby,\" I greet her as I raise my head from the novel.\"Hi, Isla,\" she says but doesn't sit.  \"I know we made plans to hang out every Thursday after school, but I gotta go to town now.  I'm sorry.\"\"Oh,\" I say, the disappointment clear in my tone.  But then I remember, and I try to act less upset and more excited.  \"It's your date with Zac, right?\"\"Yeah, and once again, not a date,\" Ruby replies.  \"We're meeting at 3:45, and it takes at least 10 minutes to walk to town, and that's if I walk fast.  I should probably be going now.\"  She hovers at the door, and it dawns on me that she's implicitly apologising for not hanging out with me today, even though we made plans.\"Yeah, no problem,\" I shrug, disguising my dismay under a layer of nonchalance.  \"You better walk fast then.  Don't wanna be late.\"\"Right,\" Ruby nods.  \"Bye then, see you tomorrow.\"She leaves, and once again I feel a sort of emptiness in my heart, but I dismiss the feeling, knowing that nothing good will come out of descending down the rabbit hole of misery.Letting out a sigh, I collect my belongings and head over to the music department, deciding that some time alone on the harp can get my mind off things and is also a relaxing pastime.However, as soon as I enter the music building, I come face to face with Elena.\"You again?\" I exclaim, exasperated.  \"Do you really have nothing better to do with your time than pissing me off?\"\"Not everything revolves around you, Isla,\" Elena teases, her tone still playful

to make my way up the stairs, on a mission to find an empty practice room with a harp for me to play.***\"Isla!\" Nisha shakes my shoulder, startling me out of my stupor. \"Isla, you're lucky Miss

She looks smug, and as much as I'd be happy to see her. I'm not. Because I'm sure what she's about to tell me isn't exactly why my ears want to hear.Behind her is the bodyguard she cares so much about. The only reason she has one is because our father is way too paranoid about safety for his only daughter. Guess he didn't really see his son needing one.I laughed at my own joke since my own father was practically my slave. She stands in front of me, smirk, and her blush pink suitcase rolled beside her. Behind her is Elion, who probably had to follow her to a thousand stores before they even stepped on the plane here to China. He's a handsome young boy, earns money out of this simple job, and is also like 27 so. Older than I am.\"Nat.\" She says, rolls it out like it's a curse, and gives me her best teasing grin. \"What?\" I ask, I don't really want to know, but I'm sure if I put up with her little fit right now, I might be able to sleep later. \"I've wanna meet your boy, where is he?\" I roll my eyes so hard I can hear them, \"A skater, he's a skater, not my boy.\"\"Same difference Nat, what's the fucking lining.\" She states sarcastically, giving me a crossed eyed look. I'm hoping Kabuki is so far away from here that she won't be able to harass him. He's already on edge already, I think he'd be panicking about the short program. He never gets it right. \"Get out of here, Ava. I have to go, and you're going to give my skater person trauma.\"\"Ha! You're skater! You said,'My skater,' admit it!\" \"Shut up.\" I snap, she's so annoying when she gets off an airplane, bothers everyone like she's attention starved.I love my sister. God, I have a soft spot for her, and I know it. But right now, she's not my favorite person. I recall our phone call, the reason I hoped she'd be late for the flight that is practically parallel with ours. \"Gosh, heart eyes for a gorgey boy! What a fucking improvement from all those very obviously drug dealers you hang on to.\" \"Ava, I don't hang on to anybody. I can't even date without it being a controversial news announcement.\" \"Ha! That is why this one will be fine. Romance between two skaters? Incroyable!\" \"I think, my girl, that you're forgetting it's between two male skaters.\"\"Ha! You admitted it! On a more serious note. Is there a difference?\" \"Of course.\" \"Whatever. Heart eyes. What will Suli think?\" At that name, my heart had stopped, what will he think? \"It doesn't matter.\" I say nonchalantly, \"Since when does he care?\" \"But he's—\"\"So?\"\"Fine, whatever, don't mind him. Go back to your ohhh tee peee.\"  \"My what?\" \"One true pairing? Duh.\"Then she hung up. She pushed me around, trying to get words out of me for a few measly minutes, and I felt a headache coming on. God, she can be so persistent about love. What love? There is no love, Avonat. But when I see Kabuki come towards me, his hair is tied in a half bun, and every single clothing he wears looks great, like a rich, stylish drug dealer. He isn't, but it looks good. And I can't ignore it, that something slightly flutters for a kid I just fucking met. _________________ᴅᴇᴀʀ ʀᴇᴀᴅᴇʀ╼╺╺╺╺╺╺╺╺ ╾ Lol short chapter cause I'm running out of ideas for Avonats pov and I haven't done the drafts for the events leading up to chapter 10 and I basically pulled this out of my ass and this is turning into a cliche ass fucking book like love at first sight but as long as I keep myself sane it won't be cringe. (Edit after proof reading haha i just fucking realized this is chapter nine so how the actual fuck will this work because I have four days to get through with the break before the SP IM CURRENTLY PANICKING😨😨)"}

The body was faced down while his limbs were stretched like a sea star above the water. His tanned skin and ruffled matted black hair certainly matched the pictures of Hao Ran they viewed whilst entering, however he was topless with only a pair of what Liya could make out to be Ralph Lauren shorts.The clear pool was now tinted with the slightest shade of rose pink, fishing out the body at that moment were a few people in hazmat suits similar to Himari's. 'Forensics seems to be doing their job well', Kaili commented as she smiled.'Well, we have to', Himari answered before twirling her hair into a tight ballerina bun, small strands of its dyed candy apple color stuck out of place when she strapped on her latex gloves'This body is going straight to Ryuu', she stated, 'Hope he likes this gift at...12pm'Dongmin blinked, 'Ryuu?''He's the new forensics guy', she smirked, 'Real smoothtalker, at least he gets the job done''Luckily', he breathed under his breath, 'We'll get to talk to him right?'She nodded, 'I don't know about him though'Pointing at Chen Fang, she tilted her head, 'After all things are complicated between you guys''I'm also on the case', he answered simply, 'It's only fair I obtain the same information as the rest of the detectives'Glancing over at the others who made no attempt to object, she shrugged, 'Okay then', she answered right as the body was lifted on a portable medical bed and was carried away, 'We'll take more pictures around here, feel free to explore the house though because it's all at our disposal''I'd rather call the family and ask more questions', Dongmin suggested instead'Then you can go do that', Kaili chuckled, 'I'll continue with the girlfriend, learn more about her''I'll explore the victim's room', Liya decided, '..What about you Chen Fang?'He remained quiet before crossing his arms, 'I'll go with you', he answered as her face tinted with a cherry hue, 'Come let's go'Kaili grinned sneakily at her friend who followed like a confused lamb behind him as Dongmin sighed, 'He'll come around right?''He can't resist his girlfriend', she answered before giggling, 'Let's see how long he can resist for though'--DeleteCreated with Sketch.As they both inspected HaoRan's room, they couldn't help but feel as though they stepped into a luxury hotel. The pillowy white bed was arranged perfectly with silken beige and tanned cushions and hung on the walls were timeless pieces representing the roaring seas and the great mountains that overlooked the large room. Opposite the bed was a great glass door that led to a simple balcony where two chairs were placed facing the bloody pool below. 'Looks like it rained heavily last night', he picked up after peering through the thick glass to see droplets remaining on the chairs, 'His room looks pretty neat though'Liya immediately bent down to examine the expensive carpet, 'This shade...looks off', she murmured, flicking her eyes back and forth'What?'She pointed at a slight off white area at the edge of the pristine carpet, 'You see that too right?'He viewed it carefully before nodding, 'Bag it up then'As she tied up the evidence, she looked at him as he stared at the pool from the high distance above, 'Where did you go?', she asked, 'I'm genuinely curious'He stayed silent, refusing any attempt to answer before she exhaled patiently, 'I just want to know', she continued, standing up with a building frustration bubbling in her, 'I feel like, I deserve to know. After 6 months of having to deal with you just disappearing can't you just tell me?'The quietness only thickened and a ticking hanging wall clock was the only thing that could be heard for what seemed like centuries passing'Fine', she spat before facing HaoRan's walk in closet, 'Stay silent and go wherever you want. No one will stop you anymore and...no one will care anymore. It's not like you have a girlfriend or friends anymore anyway'His jaw tightened at her final words but he still kept his mouth shut and instead began envisioning what happened the night Hao Ran died. 'I'll tell her eventually', he kept reassuring himself, 'Eventually..'Snarling, Liya balled her hands into fists and knocked the hollow wood of HaoRan's filled shelves aggressively, 'He just-ARGH!', she complained aloud right as her eyes lay on a Jaeger-LeCoultre watch perfectly lined up with other silver rings and leather bands'Woah', she blurted intrigued by the classy items, 'But this..'She stopped in front of a wooden framed picture standing attentively on one of the higher shelves. Inside showed several beaming faces holding scrolls with red ribbons tied neatly around each identical one. 'Graduation', she read the black markered words at the bottom of the imageWhat made her pick up the frame wasn't Hao Ran who had his arms around two other jolly men but a scribbled and etched out face in the photograph. The markings were purposely there to ruin and remove whoevers face he clearly didn't want in the joyous memory. 'I'll be taking this', she chuckled, putting the photo in a clear bag'Liya..'She turned, eyeing Chen Fang who crept up behind her. He lowered his head slightly and lead against the closet doors awkwardly while she rolled her eyes, 'About earlier, I'm so-''Save it', she interrupted before stomping her boots past him, 'The closet is all yours now, I'm done here'And with that she walked away, the echoing clanking of her boots pounding into Chen Fang's head before he rubbed his temples, 'I think I messed up', he realized Walking further into the closet, he judged the rich cologne and the laundry detergent that hung onto all the tailored suits that looked like different trees covering each square foot of the space around him. At the back of what seemed to be an infinite wardrobe, he expected to have reached another world by now just like his favorite book, however he saw a large  safe instead. It was immovable and a simple pin pad was what kept whatever secrets it stored safely insideBending down near it's sturdy edges, he touched it briefly and his hand jolted back in surprise, 'It's loose', he realized, 'It's been opened'He wedged his finger in between the door and pushed it gently. When it refused to budge, he gripped it tighter and ripped it open furiously. It's hinges screamed and the door lay open widely while he investigated using his phone flashlight. A few antique coins and diamond encrusted Rolex's dazzled against the bright light however he realized that they were arranged in a strange way, as though they were meant to fit around something. 'Someone took something from here', he determined, 'I doubt Hao Ran left this open intentionally before his death'He rubbed his thumb on the cool metal surface in thought, 'Watch it be some documents. All victims love to hide those'Sneaking out of the room, he noticed Liya slowly turning the doorknob to another room East of where he was standing. His eyes trailed her in amusement as her serious face reminded him of a bunny furiously trying to much a carrot. 'She became cuter somehow', he said to himself, 'Liya'She stood up straight sharply at the sound of her voice before scoffing, 'Oh it's you', she looked at him as he lumbered towards her, 'Why don't you-'He clamped his hand over her mouth to silence her, 'I'm going to investigate this room with you whether you like it or not'She struggled to scream and her words twisted into a muffled lump, 'Deal with it', he suddenly smirked before releasing herOnce freed, she couldn't help but feel shocked yet in awe that he suddenly found the courage to acknowledge her again, 'Fine', she answered quietly after he entered the next room, 'I'll deal with it'"}

As I looked around I noticed a white blanket of snow covering the trees, ground, and houses. I was surprised by how quiet everything seemed. The only sound I could hear was my boots crunching in the snow. The smell of damp pine trees made the air feel fresh and clean. As I was walking through our neighbourhood, I noticed that there was new family moving in . I went there and saw a boy who was around my age but suddenly I tripped over and the boy saw me , feeling embarrassed i just left the place and went back home .After I came  home I  was preparing for school the day after.The next day at school our home room teacher introduced us a new transfer student who was the same boy from before and his name Sam . Sam is very brilliant boy. That is what the teachers said and they even said that he had won so many trophies in different things like in mathematics , running and also in some other sports too. Our teacher told him to sit next to me and he is gonna be my desk mate for the year . As he sat next to me I began introduced myself to him that I'm Rosabella and that he can call me bella if wanted to. But , he gave me a cold look and rolled his eyes and just sit there . seeing this my friend Isabelle said \" it's gonna be a tough year for you bella \" . "}
